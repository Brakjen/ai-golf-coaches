{"chunk": "hey guys Milo lines along with Ed Lasser and we're out here at beautiful Superstition Mountain we've got a video special for all you who have ever struggled powering out of the top with", "start": 0.08, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "your arms or hanging back on your Trail side and today we're going to show you how to get to your lead side and how to power it with your lower", "start": 9.44, "duration": 17.358}
{"chunk": "body with this magic move let's start with the the root of our issue here so a lot of people who are too armsy or stuck", "start": 24.0, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "on the trail side what they're actually doing is they're winding up and loading to the trail side but not reentering or", "start": 32.32, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "creating this ball of space as they're finishing their winding what's going on there what's what's causing the problem nine times out of 10 either there's too", "start": 42.2, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "much Sway and they're in right Bend at the top or they reverse seeing it this direction and then they teeter totter back this way so if I", "start": 50.559, "duration": 19.598999999999997}
{"chunk": "tilt left and my pelvis Glides too far to the right correct then I'm gonna you have no choice otherwise you have to push forward and then your swing", "start": 60.559, "duration": 16.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "direction is way far out to the right once we add our trigger in and we have a little bit of rib sway we want to feel it's okay to feel that our ribs are", "start": 68.84, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "slightly outside of our pelvis but we never want our pelvis outside of our ribs and as our ribs slightly move to", "start": 77.6, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "the right and we start to wind up the Greater wind up we make over here we'll run at a range of motion and we'll start", "start": 84.759, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "to reenter our pelvis earlier and you'll feel that you're actually moving left as your arms are still going up ah so we", "start": 92.24, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "want to feel like we're starting to move left as our arms are finishing that last little bit of the", "start": 99.64, "duration": 15.56}
{"chunk": "wind up now interestingly enough depending upon a person's mobility and flexibility and strength and central nervous system that feeling probably may", "start": 108.2, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "have to be later or earlier depending upon the person you may have some people with some serious significant restrictions and so they may start to", "start": 117.68, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "feel like it's happening right now depends on the person or if they're able to make a bigger windup it may happen somewhere around arm parallel but", "start": 125.28, "duration": 18.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "certainly no later than that because by then you should already be working this direction to to go along with your point we could use two bookend players we got", "start": 134.44, "duration": 15.879}
{"chunk": "John ROM whose swing is very short you see him almost immediately start to go that direction and his and then there", "start": 142.36, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "like a jake nap who's got a really long more you know he lengthens everything out he probably if we went and looked at when his pelvis starts recenter it's", "start": 149.68, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "probably a little later right certainly yeah so what we're getting at here is that how we wind up leads us to Landing", "start": 159.56, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "correctly into the lead side it certainly gives us a better opportunity there's no doubt yes so in a proper motion we're going to see a little", "start": 168.8, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "trigger little shift wind that look about right that looks about right it just seems like it all kind of flows together when you do it I don't", "start": 176.8, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "feel like I have to shift the shift just kind of organically happened well assuming the windup is an appropriate wind up because you run out of space it", "start": 188.959, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "almost has to work that way you don't have an option especially if you're intendance to hit a golf ball toward a certain direction yes so as I'm winding", "start": 198.4, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "we've got a nice little head cover in here to kind of denote where the Center my pelvis is and you'll be able to see as I'm winding you can probably see", "start": 205.64, "duration": 19.8}
{"chunk": "that it translates a little forward it does a little forward but in addition it's a little back it's not just forward", "start": 217.84, "duration": 15.078000000000001}
{"chunk": "so you can sit here and you can simply push forward but have no depth that's not what we're looking for either we're looking for a match up of the both yes", "start": 225.519, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "and if we look at it from the start of the swing from the trigger there's actually a little a little shifting so it actually moves a little to the right", "start": 234.48, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "first and then as I wind we see it wander back that way and then Circle back again and to be honest", "start": 242.799, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "with you if you look at most of the best players in the world of course there's varying but you rarely see people their max pressure in their Trail leg is about", "start": 251.2, "duration": 19.438}
{"chunk": "shaft parallel to the ground about here mhm by this time things are Mo moving so fast and so violently they're already on", "start": 260.759, "duration": 17.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "a Gra ra and they're already circling back this direction and if they don't they're just too late to the party and there's no popping the bat okay so I'm", "start": 269.32, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "going to hit a couple I want to show Trail View first so you can see how this head cover moves and then we'll move the camera down the line and and see what", "start": 276.6, "duration": 17.438}
{"chunk": "that looks like as well so Milo now when you hit this one but I'm going to video on and I placed a golf ball just at the edge of your right", "start": 285.199, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "hip in the shadow and we're going to clearly see how you create a ball of space and start working Target side with depth at the", "start": 303.479, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "same time you're hitting this ball so can you hit it for us I'll give it my best shot perfect so I think you guys will be able to see as soon as he he gets to", "start": 311.68, "duration": 20.04}
{"chunk": "about right about P2 is shaft parallel this entire time if he was on a swing Catalyst his Force vector would be up in this direction so he'd be going this way", "start": 323.919, "duration": 19.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "with some depth and some lateral to land left to unwind himself he's not pushing he's not standing up he's not pulling his arms down the arms are reacting to", "start": 332.96, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "how his pressure is moving so now that we've shown you this magic move how the the pelvis circles in the correct way", "start": 343.479, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "what are some things we can do to help people train this I often like for my students to do the step drill because I find that um by having the club out", "start": 352.28, "duration": 20.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "front pressuring first and as it passes them they're already going this Direction with a slight step this way that allows the the pressure and the way", "start": 361.4, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "their body is moving to be slightly ahead of where the club head is to generate Max Speed throughout the ball okay so the way you're describing the step drill you wanted to start with the", "start": 370.8, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "club with your feet touching rough feet close together the club's going to swing out front and then I'm going to step little step away as it passes you now", "start": 379.44, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "step okay so you've got to learn how to time that yes it's a drill I use often with with my students as well I find many of them really struggle to", "start": 388.4, "duration": 19.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "coordinate at first and so you I like to have them give it a little momentum where they toss it forward and just learn to kind of dance", "start": 397.56, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "with the weight of the golf club a little bit I like that and then once they get where they can dance with the weight of the golf club then we can start adding speed and then we could", "start": 406.68, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "even introduce a golf ball to it and let them hit it the reason that people struggle with it is that the they don't counter the momentum of the golf club at", "start": 414.759, "duration": 18.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "the correct time what they wind up doing is almost moving at the same time they're trying to move the club taking", "start": 422.639, "duration": 15.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "their steps it's why it's important that as the that's why I like the little toss as the club goes forward I can begin my", "start": 430.96, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "away yes and then as the club begins to move away I can begin my forward step right exactly and that helped me learn", "start": 439.8, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "how to create a opposition mhm and that's how we really learn how to move athletically and dynamically because we're opposing momentum we're we're", "start": 447.4, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "stretching things out and then letting it go the other direction right so commonly when I'm teaching students I'll have them do a basket full of balls or a kettle bell or something like that but I", "start": 455.68, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "don't have that with me today so I'm going to use this this downshift board and you're going to do the same thing it's going to move slightly forward Step", "start": 464.319, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "Go Step Go Step Go step go and that should translate itself into your swing to some degree but you'll notice the shift of pressure", "start": 472.12, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "was always going the opposite direction of that board it was never going in the same cuz if you're going the same direction as the board what happens I lose my balance exactly that thing's", "start": 481.84, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "heavy enough to pull you off balance I I love either a kettle bell or any of those yeah even just my arms just learning how to counter them as well", "start": 490.319, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "right okay so now I I want to show you real time face on what this step drill would look like while hitting a shot and", "start": 498.68, "duration": 15.321000000000002}
{"chunk": "then I'll also show you how the downshift board can really help you learn to sequence your pressure as well thats pretty good okay so like you", "start": 506.36, "duration": 19.159}
{"chunk": "saw with the the step drill there was a clear pressure to the left and then step away you're going to see something similar here with the downshift board", "start": 524.959, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "I'm going to pressure left before I go right and then back left hopefully I can figure out how to time", "start": 533.36, "duration": 15.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "this I did okay yeah so to tie this all together and put a bow on it so everybody can really understand the magic move that we're", "start": 546.279, "duration": 20.162}
{"chunk": "talking about it really starts long before when we see it happen 100% so if we want to be able to land our pressure", "start": 563.24, "duration": 17.278999999999996}
{"chunk": "back to the left we have to learn how to create a proper winding that allows our our pressure or our pelvis to start to", "start": 571.839, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "wander back where we want it right while we're still winding that that's kind of the magic so once we figured out this", "start": 581.32, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "magic motion quite a few things are going to start to line themselves up our ability to control our low Point gets much better players who have often", "start": 589.2, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "really pulled down out the top kind of throw in the club a lot of times that'll just go away because now they're able to use their body more efficiently well", "start": 598.48, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "it's funny how when you often see students when they kind of get this feel you can't pull down because you've got the mass already Landing left and", "start": 606.56, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "getting out of the way it almost it's impossible it would be akin to me saying throw your golf club down the Fairway and doing it with your arms because", "start": 615.6, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "you'd fall off balance instinctually you're going to shift pressure push away have some depth in your pelv us and then sling your arms to toss that club it's", "start": 623.0, "duration": 17.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "the most instinctive thing we do as humans and once this all starts to line up a lot of those other things become second nature exactly so now that you", "start": 632.12, "duration": 16.279}
{"chunk": "know the magic move make sure you get out there and do some step drills maybe get yourself a downshift board and work on these things and for further help", "start": 639.959, "duration": 19.961}
