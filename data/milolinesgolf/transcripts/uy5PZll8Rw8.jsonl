{"chunk": "make it super light in the back swing and then feel it heavy in transition you got to help me understand how do I make this club feel lighter", "start": 8.0, "duration": 19.641}
{"chunk": "okay so for me at least to make it feel lighter I need to have it feel above my hands and sort of the center Mass really up stand it up yeah so the more vertical", "start": 22.359, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "the club sits I don't even hardly have to hold it to keep it up I'm just barely gripping that club yeah now if I start to tilt the golf club back this way oh", "start": 32.52, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "all of a sudden I can feel the weight of it it feels heavy now or this way or this way anything you see a lot of that yeah well anything that gets the the", "start": 40.64, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "center of mass out away from the grip cap yeah it's heavy there y it's heavy over here heavy out here heavy back here", "start": 47.92, "duration": 21.919}
{"chunk": "so that some point towards the top of the back swing we want to feel like the weight of the club is it's like weightless so you think of like a a", "start": 59.399, "duration": 19.88}
{"chunk": "dumbbell or a kettle bell if I kind of it when it's just standing or I'm just holding it up it's pretty heavy but if I", "start": 68.92, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "start to kind of move it up to about here it gets really light for a second yeah when it's floating it's really light right you think of your swing set", "start": 77.4, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "analogy yes so you're kind of riding that swing you get up to the very top on the front end actually and you feel like you're floating you're weightless for a", "start": 86.759, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "second right yeah and then you fall back in the chair and you go back the other way yeah and then you get to the top on this end and you're floating yeah and that's why it's fun but the only way to", "start": 95.32, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "make that happen is if we have that nice up part the standing up and so that's what we're going to talk about in this video is how we make this club feel", "start": 103.439, "duration": 20.242}
{"chunk": "weightless and so part of the key is as we're winding this club up we don't want to swing it back and get the center of", "start": 113.24, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "mass behind us that feels That's Heavy I want to feel like I'm taking this club and I'm tossing it up right here it feels like it doesn't weigh anything so", "start": 121.0, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "a perfect way to practice this and you do this all the time is get a heavy club or you can get a club uh you can get one of those rings to put around the donut", "start": 129.92, "duration": 17.28}

{"chunk": "swing fast too but it can be a good way to feel like wow I really got to stand this up to make it feel light right so if I have", "start": 146.239, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "this power hitter here I'm just like the only time it's feeling light is right in here if I go this way that's heavy so", "start": 156.16, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "how do we get this to stand up that's the question so much of it has to do with how we energize it so we want to feel like we're putting the energy into", "start": 164.0, "duration": 17.561}
{"chunk": "it with our chest yeah and our legs so it's we're using this loading system to put energy into it and then we're", "start": 171.76, "duration": 19.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "feeling like we're we're kind of letting our wrist toss the club up yeah so there's a bit of a folding or extending", "start": 181.92, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "of that trail wrist maybe a little radial mixed in yeah it's got to go a little radial cuz it's starts owner so because it starts in a little bit of an owner position it's going to get itself", "start": 191.4, "duration": 20.521}
{"chunk": "back to here and yeah with hinge so it's going to have kind of a little combination of this purely extension", "start": 200.72, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "it's hard to go in purely extension with owner so that that's got to come out it's got to go back to neutral and then extension which tosses that club up", "start": 209.0, "duration": 19.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "nicely now the other thing I see toss it up out you you mentioned pressure shift kind of energizing the system but also how you're bending your upper spine and", "start": 218.76, "duration": 19.0}
