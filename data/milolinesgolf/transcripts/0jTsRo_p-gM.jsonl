{"chunk": "had a few requests for swing analysis of the top ladies in the game so I figured I'd start with the top three players in the world so you can kind of get an idea", "start": 22.47, "duration": 21.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "of how they swing it relative to my ideas on how to swing a golf club and relative to the mint in the game so", "start": 33.719, "duration": 19.531}
{"chunk": "let's just put her in motion here you can see she's got a beautiful backswing before we put her in motion I want to", "start": 44.25, "duration": 15.778}
{"chunk": "just talk about her setup so you can see her rear ends not really far behind her heels but if you look at her where her", "start": 51.149, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "armpits are they're out in front of her toes so before I even put this swing in motion I know either she's gonna suck a", "start": 60.57, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "rear-end dam or her upper body's gonna pull back just a little bit to get balanced over her feet now we'll see if she goes into motion she stays pretty", "start": 67.86, "duration": 19.969}
{"chunk": "much out where she started and then she immediately starts to rotate she's got a pretty awesome transition though she", "start": 77.759, "duration": 17.471}
{"chunk": "reflexes her knees and she's back to square by the time her or her left arm reaches parallel to the ground so that's", "start": 86.61, "duration": 19.47}
{"chunk": "pretty sweet and you can see immediately she started to have some pull back so her head is now well back of where it started now", "start": 97.5, "duration": 19.26}

{"chunk": "first wing is very rotational and the face is very able through the hitting area not a lot", "start": 122.299, "duration": 15.811}
{"chunk": "of rotation so very similar to what you see with the best male players in the world one thing that's a little different is it impact there's not a lot", "start": 130.39, "duration": 21.78}
{"chunk": "of lean of the shaft and that's pretty typical amongst the ladies if they lean the shaft they're not swinging it hard enough to get out elevation on its ball", "start": 140.71, "duration": 20.34}
{"chunk": "so they need a little less shaft lean so the club's gonna tend to line up a little more with their left arm at impact to get the ball in the air", "start": 151.0, "duration": 17.29}
{"chunk": "pretty darn good no other thing I want to look at is the face on view here you can see in transition how she immediately goes into rotation her left", "start": 162.42, "duration": 21.61}
{"chunk": "hip stays low for quite a while until she gets back re squared which is about there then her hips start to get about", "start": 173.26, "duration": 17.1}

{"chunk": "Gitano gone I believe is how you pronounce your name and boy this is an athletic looking motion so you could see", "start": 209.47, "duration": 16.17}
{"chunk": "very classic looking takeaway very symmetrical pivot of her legs you can", "start": 215.799, "duration": 15.09}
{"chunk": "see her right legs pulled back about the same amount or her left legs gone forward so pretty symmetrical hip turn her heads", "start": 225.04, "duration": 16.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "lowered so she's compressed into the ground a little bit and you can see her right pocket or her right rear end is", "start": 233.709, "duration": 18.572}
{"chunk": "slightly behind the line now shiri squares before she gets her left arm back to parallel to the ground so this is a", "start": 241.81, "duration": 19.459}
{"chunk": "pretty early Rhys query and she's got a little bit of a steep approach so she probably plays a little cut out of gas", "start": 254.53, "duration": 17.430999999999997}
{"chunk": "just looking at this motion but she looks like there's a real powerful golfer so you could see that pivot is", "start": 263.77, "duration": 17.67}
{"chunk": "beautiful she stays in two in the box she doesn't move forward her hands come in a little high I kind of like mine do so I would just guess she's a little", "start": 273.1, "duration": 17.25}
{"chunk": "cutter of the ball impact a lot of Bend in that right arm you have a little window right there let's see how stable that face is you can see that face is", "start": 280.87, "duration": 19.11}
{"chunk": "turned down pointing pretty much down toward the ball so it's pretty squared of a target line early into the ball and", "start": 291.4, "duration": 16.499}
{"chunk": "threw the ball you can see that clubface is really square for a long time no wonder she's number two in the world looks like a really powerful golf swing", "start": 299.47, "duration": 22.32}
{"chunk": "a pretty darn dynamic rotational move there so you can see where that one", "start": 308.38, "duration": 20.641}
{"chunk": "would work and number three in the world here we have Minji Lee now let's just", "start": 318.94, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "take a look at this motion she's got so you can see she stays in the box pretty good in the backswing maybe a little bit", "start": 328.33, "duration": 16.378}
{"chunk": "of motion move forward and it's with everything not just her hips it's er her head moves a little forward and her hip hips move in a little more and her head", "start": 337.599, "duration": 21.842}
{"chunk": "pulls back so you could see she's kind of standing a little more straight up and down there that I would prefer to", "start": 347.02, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "see so her pelvis has sucked under her a little bit but she managed to manage us", "start": 355.18, "duration": 20.52}
{"chunk": "to move the club shaft very efficiently and create a very stable release through", "start": 365.86, "duration": 16.83}
{"chunk": "the ball so even though there's things that I probably would work on with her she's got an awesome motion", "start": 374.56, "duration": 21.8}
{"chunk": "I've never seen anybody get back to square as soon as she does in the downswing that's a really fast square", "start": 385.89, "duration": 21.21}
{"chunk": "and you can see how literal that how little lateral motion she has going through the ball you really see that from I drew a vertical line off of her", "start": 396.51, "duration": 18.630000000000003}
{"chunk": "left foot and you could see as she turns there is hardly any lateral motion there it's just pure pivot she has a little", "start": 406.24, "duration": 25.57}

{"chunk": "and almost goes backwards for a split second and then continues on its way and that has to do with the fact that she really opens up early in the transition", "start": 430.3, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "and her arms fall a little behind her but because she rotates so much she can still create a really stable face", "start": 439.63, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "through the ball pretty cool at the golf swing you you", "start": 447.43, "duration": 10.790000000000001}
