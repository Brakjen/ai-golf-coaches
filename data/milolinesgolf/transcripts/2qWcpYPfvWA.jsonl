{"chunk": "see how that sacrum just peels out of there and works dramatically in this video we're going to talk about what the upper body is doing to correspond with", "start": 49.62, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "that and to be a team yes and we call this ribcage sway right yes and I think what's really awesome with it is it", "start": 57.059, "duration": 15.899999999999999}
{"chunk": "marries so well with what the pelvis is doing so again if we go back to that like rear view or posterior posterior view we see what that sacred move is doing", "start": 65.519, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "but it's really important in this system as you brought up not to just look at one point you want to look at the entire system so we got to look at what the rib", "start": 73.619, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "cage is doing as well just so that we can see what the center of mass and the ribs is doing to go ahead and help or partner well with the pelvis or the", "start": 82.2, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "sacred well let's get into it let's do it why don't we do this Cameron why don't you face the camera and then hug that Golf Club all right so what's really cool we're gonna we're gonna show", "start": 90.119, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "spine Bend in this and we're going to show them the proper way to do it and an improper way to do it so let's show improper Bend first which would be the", "start": 99.0, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "center of mass and the ribs working this way that hurts yep yep so first we bent the spine but it's going to leak down here in the L spine that's why you go", "start": 107.159, "duration": 17.581}
{"chunk": "that hurts doesn't feel good right so the center of mass Works away from the Target and the ribs when performing that act now show rib cage sway on your", "start": 115.92, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "own we're going to go forward towards the target there you go excellent so this is what's droopy do that again from setup so he's neutral spine here the", "start": 125.04, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "center of mass and the ribs is going to go towards the target ooh but the trail side the right side went into Bend and what's really cool like from our view", "start": 133.739, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "right here Milo we can see that now all the bend notice you don't go ow yeah it's because it's high on the T the thoracic spine now it's all", "start": 142.26, "duration": 19.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "thoracic this side's expanded this side is yep yep exactly it's like an accordion right so do that one more time", "start": 151.739, "duration": 17.161}
{"chunk": "that's another really good thing to see is as as Cameron's showing that these ribs are all separating these ribs collapse on top of one another but you", "start": 160.92, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "probably feel that underneath your armpits cam am I right and saying that correct it feels just a slight I say pinch but it's not painful in any way", "start": 169.2, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "shape or form it's just this is the actual it's a scrunch beautiful exactly there's no there's no pain there I feel like I can be in this position and you probably feel like a stretch right here", "start": 177.12, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "yep so let's do that from post fear posterior view so we just put a sweater on him so we can see some markers that we put on his spine to denote kind of", "start": 186.06, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "where the the spine is yep so let's show the boo-boo the bad bad bin first so you see there how like very little is", "start": 195.0, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "happening some is happening in here but you see how drastically the these you can see the bend down in here right my little like around in like lower T and", "start": 204.36, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "all the L and that's where Cam goes ow yeah it doesn't feel good yeah you're putting all the pressure and it also sends the center of mass of the ribs behind the center of mass of the pelvis", "start": 213.659, "duration": 18.540999999999997}
{"chunk": "so now it's tilted over there exactly so what's the sacrum going to do in that pattern slide exactly yep bad right so", "start": 222.9, "duration": 15.419}
{"chunk": "let's go uh rib sway proper there we go and you can even see it in the wrinkles in the shirt see how all the all the band is like right up in here you can", "start": 230.099, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "see how it's like straight up and then it goes whoop yep Bend up here and like T and C it's beautiful look right there", "start": 238.56, "duration": 15.059000000000001}
{"chunk": "so that's really important because again we I think we were talking about this off camera Milo how the center of mass and the ribs and the center of mass and", "start": 245.94, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "the pelvis they counter one another for us to just stay in Balance so if Cameron you can make a backswing for us right now there you go there goes the sacrum", "start": 254.099, "duration": 18.422}
{"chunk": "towards the target the center of mass of the ribs went away from the Target now as the sacrum starts to move away and cam starts to rib sway back forward", "start": 263.34, "duration": 17.538999999999998}
{"chunk": "there we go now we're in a good good position so you can see that the sacrum is working away there you go no it looks like a real golf swing yep let's do that", "start": 272.0, "duration": 19.66}
{"chunk": "again okay so if I belt loop yeah and I go away that way there you go we can see all this really beautiful bend up here by the way", "start": 280.979, "duration": 18.06}
{"chunk": "in our opinion very very healthy move when it comes to bending like you see this in babies", "start": 290.94, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "crawling you see it in swimmers you see it and and guys throwing a baseball Runners Runners you see everybody Bend", "start": 298.8, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "but the bad place to bend is in the L spine that's a friggin like tree trunk down there we don't want to bend the tree trunk that's how the facet joints", "start": 306.36, "duration": 15.058999999999997}
{"chunk": "are lined up they're not designed to bend down there the t-spine is designed to be mobile and rotational exactly the l-spine is designed to be", "start": 314.34, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "kind of solid it's it's where your core you need your core on so that it holds that solid yeah absolutely and so rib sway is is really important for a number", "start": 323.039, "duration": 17.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "of reasons number one is we need like and I think your term is landing on your left side in my opinion that's the landing mechanism we're getting the", "start": 331.86, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "center of mass and the ribs working back forward towards the target from the rib sway the sway also because I could get my ribs moving back forward again but", "start": 340.8, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "not bounce into this right Bend and go this way well what's that going to do to my golf swing steep steep over the top nowhere in a wall that's a hacker's move", "start": 349.74, "duration": 15.181}
{"chunk": "that's a hacker's move so right there then you'll still see this extend and the and the ribs work away now I'm still in a bad position but at least I got the golf club in an okay spot at delivery", "start": 357.84, "duration": 18.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "that's what a good player would come up with for their match up with that yeah face yeah this to show it out yep versus", "start": 366.84, "duration": 16.519}
{"chunk": "the most dynamic players are going to have more of the the bend from up in the t-spine up from the ribs up exactly and", "start": 374.78, "duration": 15.341}
{"chunk": "so I'm going to keep going back to this because it's like the perfect word for this it's all a system yeah right like the pelvis and the ribs work in harmony", "start": 382.86, "duration": 17.579}
{"chunk": "with one another yep right if you don't get the center of mass of the ribs up and you're trying to move the sacrum away it's not going to feel good you're not going to hit quality shots you're", "start": 391.319, "duration": 16.261}
{"chunk": "never going to compress it your bottom out is going to get whacked you're not going to have face control blah blah it feels very unathletic too I think is the the big takeaway from that is like when", "start": 399.78, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "when you're striking a golf ball and you're moving in a your system is moving in in harmony it doesn't feel like a lot", "start": 408.0, "duration": 16.379}
{"chunk": "of effort it feels very athletic feels very easy yeah Cameron if you can go back in there again and let's let's go face on with holding the golf club", "start": 415.74, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "traditionally from right here and Camera needs to rib sway or laterally move away from the target you", "start": 424.08, "duration": 15.658000000000001}
{"chunk": "see a lot of really high level players throughout history do this like early in their golf swing Stinson does it dramatically tiger really did it in 2000", "start": 431.699, "duration": 16.442}
{"chunk": "doesn't do it as much anymore but in essence if Cameron goes rib sway into his Trail side here there we go he's got lateral movement and and Lead side Bend", "start": 439.38, "duration": 19.919}
{"chunk": "left Bend like in the first two feet of his golf swing so we've knocked out both of those stones right shifted as pressure because when the ribs swayed a", "start": 449.28, "duration": 16.26}
{"chunk": "little bit the pressure moved into the trail foot yeah like that too because it's not a pressure shift of me sliding laterally it's just the way mass is moving they just moved a little bit of", "start": 458.099, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "your upper Mass yep exactly now you could move this laterally and this laterally and it's not going to feel very good at all right unathletic again", "start": 466.02, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "like you you always talk about so let's do that one more time with the first portion here there you go now I don't want to knock you right in the teeth you're not going to hit it let's go", "start": 475.08, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "ahead and turn and let the arms rise and that's what's going to come complete the backswing which is awesome so Cameron just did all three things that we just", "start": 484.259, "duration": 16.141}
{"chunk": "talked about lateral movement early right you can do that early both in the away and the forward swing and get your", "start": 492.0, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "your bends more or less all done early in in both in both moves as well the away and the forward then you're just left with rotation exactly we're going", "start": 500.28, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "to show kind of a modified two-piece drill that we'd love to do here at the Academy so let's show rib sway early good so now what Cameron's done is he's", "start": 509.52, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "knocked out left lateral Bend and Rib lateral movement there now all he's left with is turning to the top and hitting", "start": 517.62, "duration": 15.378}
{"chunk": "it beautiful so again it's like this lateral move you", "start": 525.959, "duration": 16.262}
{"chunk": "just do it early I mean in the backswing we can get this done early now I'm just left with turning now as the sacred moves if I", "start": 533.58, "duration": 15.620000000000001}
{"chunk": "move this laterally towards the Target and then work into that right Bend there's that lateral and bend early now I can just turn boom just makes it so", "start": 546.6, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "simple get your laterals and your bins done early in turn so another really really cool view let's show that same exact drill so nice and lateral here", "start": 554.94, "duration": 18.181}
{"chunk": "boom so you can see how now we've got that that lead lead side Bend here you can see the shape that's that's made right here I'm out of the way go ahead", "start": 563.7, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "and complete and hit it foreign that's nice we'll be able to see and we'll slow this down for you guys how", "start": 572.519, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "his spine is moving from that rear view there we're going to get one more angle here real fast so guys let's let's recap this real fast", "start": 583.019, "duration": 17.181}
{"chunk": "and just talk about this is all one big system and it's not only my ribs moving it's also how my pelvis is moving as", "start": 608.7, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "we've shown in another video it's all one big global system and the key is we want to move our middle well yes exactly", "start": 616.68, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "like I think there's three basic systems in the entire golf swing there's the club system and how it's just designed right and then there's the arms and", "start": 624.6, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "hands that swing the instrument and the body's there just to support the swing of the arms and the hands well if the body doesn't do its job the arms and", "start": 633.779, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "hands are just left to their own way too much work yeah that's where we get into this whole consistency thing yeah I want more consistency well if you want more", "start": 641.519, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "consistency you need to move your middle well so that the arms and hands have an easier job to control the club yeah exactly I always say that the the body", "start": 650.279, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "is the transport system for the arms and hands yes beautiful it transports it in space so you can accelerate fast and then your arms and hands can make the", "start": 658.92, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "little minute adjustments we need to make the ball go where we want that's such a cool way to say it I'm probably going to steal that just so you know there you go okay sweet that's all good", "start": 667.92, "duration": 17.539}
