{"chunk": "hey everybody milo here with henry we're out here at superstition mountain again we've got a really good lesson for you guys today on how our trail foot works in the golf", "start": 0.24, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "swing [Music] yeah so we talked about this before we came on camera here yeah we had about a 20-minute", "start": 14.92, "duration": 15.931000000000001}
{"chunk": "conversation trying to figure out what we were going to say here because there's a lot of different actions we've seen in the best players throughout history so there's not one", "start": 36.88, "duration": 15.758}
{"chunk": "way that people do this we we basically boiled it down to three and a half right different things we see in golf swings so it's probably another 20 but there's", "start": 44.399, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "probably a lot more but we made these are three and a half of what we see as the most common ways that people use their trail foot yeah", "start": 53.52, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "so i'm going to start with number one which i would say is probably the most common and what that looks like is as i start down", "start": 60.8, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "the trail foot stays fairly planted and as i keep going the trail foot goes to the ball you see the heel come up as the player", "start": 68.72, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "goes through so it's kind of a banking motion [Music] but it gets to the ball of the foot so the heel is not staying down", "start": 77.439, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "the next most common way i probably see it would be kind of a totally banking of the trail foot with irons you don't see this so", "start": 86.24, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "much with woods but with irons you see players who really bank this trail foot and kind of keep the heel down for a", "start": 94.72, "duration": 15.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "long time now our you said three and a half i'm assuming this banking one the half is sort of that that sliding", "start": 101.92, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "back that we've seen a little bit of history you've got guys like greg norman who kind of had a little bit of a slide of their pelvis and as they went through their", "start": 111.2, "duration": 18.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "foot kind of went that way so a little bit of a bank and slide back yeah now my preference is that we don't do that", "start": 120.479, "duration": 15.442}
{"chunk": "that generally tells you that the pressure got off the trail foot a little bit too much the player had a little too much lateral motion too much slide in the motion", "start": 128.56, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "and the sequence was a little off it's not my preference so if i show them further down the line that motion i'm starting to get a little lateral", "start": 137.2, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "here hip slides that foot bangs and then it kind of goes back and my chest still opens up and i get", "start": 146.0, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "this this tilt and a lot of sort of chest to the sky there yeah right kind of a lot of reverse c", "start": 155.44, "duration": 15.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "type motion so you're you kind of leaned back this way with this foot going this way and the pelvis going really forward to me that puts a lot of pressure right", "start": 163.28, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "here on the low back i mean there's been some great players that played from there and i you know i think most recently too a tiger when he won the masters", "start": 171.519, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "yep the 13th hole his right foot slipped back about a foot or two now the ground was a little wet well there's i've seen video footage of pretty much every swing tiger made", "start": 178.959, "duration": 17.362}
{"chunk": "during that tournament where that foot was his foot was kind of sliding so it's a way to do it yeah it worked for tiger that week is it the", "start": 188.56, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "best way to do it i don't think it's optimum personally it's a way to do it one one thing on that too if you go ahead and just set up again", "start": 197.519, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "and make that move a little bit when i watch it on tv it almost looks like they're taking a gut punch so this move here where no when the foot", "start": 206.159, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "goes back where it's like and they have to really keep their chest on top of the ball it's like that yeah", "start": 215.2, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "interesting it's an interesting move a lot of what i see it happening i i think the face is a little too open so the players having to throw the brakes on some things to let", "start": 225.04, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "other stuff catch up interesting so it's a timing mechanism you know they make it work all right let's talk about the other ones here so we've talked about", "start": 234.4, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "the banking with moving to the ball of the foot we've talked about banking and staying basically the whole foot down the third one is what", "start": 243.599, "duration": 19.841}
{"chunk": "some term the marching move so it's more of like what we see justin thomas jb holmes bubba watson doing where their front heels kind of up", "start": 253.84, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "and then as they change directions their lead heal so it looks like this in transition interesting yeah so that's another way", "start": 263.04, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "that we see players doing and most long drivers tend to fall into this category of where as they change directions they get", "start": 274.56, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "into the ball of their foot and they use the ball of their foot to push everything around and that's what we see from like justin thomas", "start": 282.32, "duration": 16.958}
{"chunk": "and bubba quite a few of the really long hitters out there because it's easier to put pressure into the ground out the ball of the foot", "start": 289.759, "duration": 17.122}
{"chunk": "and so that's why they generally go to the ball of foot interesting so now what's the real key between all", "start": 299.28, "duration": 15.518999999999998}
{"chunk": "of these is what happens in transition is no matter what we do we don't want this right side flying out in the way so", "start": 307.12, "duration": 17.520999999999997}
{"chunk": "if when i'm at the top of my backswing my belt buckle's pointing some amount down here when i change directions", "start": 315.68, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "it should be pointing more down and and turning and moving more down and pointing more out in front of me so down the line what he's saying here is if this is my", "start": 322.72, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "belt buckle i'll even take it out for you guys on camera it's pointing more down to the ground and beginning to point a little bit left", "start": 332.24, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "for us right-handers a little more towards our target side as opposed to going up and out towards the ball exactly so you've heard the the humping or the", "start": 340.479, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "thrusting right so it's this that you're i guess referring to and so what allows us to be able to do that well", "start": 348.96, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "our right leg or our right foot has to actually be rotating clockwise on the ground even though it might not be moving", "start": 357.36, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "what is moving is our leg and our hip socket is moving so it's rotating clockwise in this manner", "start": 366.0, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "well you did a great video on this a while back i think you had like a wooden board i brought a clipboard but if i get set up here i have a little foot flare", "start": 374.24, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "basically in transition like we talked about this belt buckle starts to go down and a little bit to the left here", "start": 383.52, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "and as i do that this slides out so this this trail foot is almost like moving that way right it's rotating clockwise yeah", "start": 391.6, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "yeah and that rotates the hips counterclockwise or opening up toward the target so in the early part of the transition that's one of the things that's happening is", "start": 401.52, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "the trail foot is rotating like that but because it doesn't actually slide hopefully it's gripping the ground right that opens our body up and then", "start": 410.4, "duration": 15.677999999999997}
{"chunk": "from that point on so once we've gotten down into here where we re-squared back up now my preference would be to see this go to the ball of the foot", "start": 418.319, "duration": 17.762}
{"chunk": "and work in this way because that's more athletic and more dynamic than it than say banking the foot is it's harder to get my pelvis to keep", "start": 427.28, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "going while i bank this foot but again there's been players that have won a lot more golf tournaments than i've ever won who banked it", "start": 435.039, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "and there's been players who've won a lot more golf tournaments than i've ever won who actually slid it back but the most dynamic players are either going to have the", "start": 443.84, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "the foot banking and getting to the ball or the marching move where it goes to the ball really early i guess the one big one we would say not to do", "start": 452.0, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "would be to get the on your toe real fast like because you you've heard about people being told that hey you need to get to your finish right well the first", "start": 461.12, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "move isn't this no we don't want to and we definitely don't want to be squashing the bug with this type motion so it's this is definitely not what we're", "start": 469.919, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "doing right so you've done this drill before and you had a great video on that before um what's an exercise that our viewers can do at home", "start": 478.479, "duration": 17.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "uh to kind of feel that sensation that you're talking about well one of my favorites would be just to make their their motion symmetrical so", "start": 486.56, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "as you turn back go ahead and allow your lead foot your lead heel to lift okay and then as you change directions", "start": 495.039, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "let your trail heel lift so plant your lead heat plant your lead heal lift your trail heel boom and so you start to feel how to", "start": 503.68, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "use the ground correctly and what i love when you do that is that belt buckle is starting to kind of go down and left like you're you're naturally does boom", "start": 513.599, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "yeah and your your heel isn't it's not going like this not spinning out it's just going like this yeah so i have why don't you do that", "start": 522.56, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "down the line just so they can sew and you can see my pelvis is never moving that way yeah so that's more that", "start": 532.16, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "marching order that's more of the marching motion so i like to practice that feeling i don't actually do it", "start": 542.16, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "except with driver so when i go to hit something really hard that's my natural motion with my irons i actually more of a bank", "start": 549.6, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "my foot interesting and a lot of it's probably because i was taught to keep my heel on the ground and so i got good at it yeah but when i", "start": 557.92, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "want to hit it as hard as i can i don't do it so what's right well it is many different ways and it's just interesting to look at some of those", "start": 566.64, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "players throughout history that have have done it in their own unique ways and been successful at it so yeah but definitely a great feeling", "start": 575.2, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "at home get that trail heel up or lead heel up plant the trail heel while the or sorry plant the lead heel while the trail heel goes up", "start": 584.24, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "as you pressure the ball of your right foot so exactly because then the pressure starts to shift correctly it goes from", "start": 593.2, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "heel to ball yeah and then toward the heel of the left foot to the ball the right and that's it's just making a circle around us because that's how pressure moves it", "start": 600.08, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "kind of moves in a circle awesome well if you like this video make sure you like uh hit the bell icon so you get notified when we have a new video up and uh make sure", "start": 608.959, "duration": 18.0}
