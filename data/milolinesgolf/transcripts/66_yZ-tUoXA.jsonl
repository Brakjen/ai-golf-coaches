{"chunk": "middle of the of the pelvis hey everybody we're back with Riley Andrews from Elite quite a bit's changed here at Elite over the last year I think", "start": 24.66, "duration": 17.041999999999998}
{"chunk": "you guys have grown your presence has gotten really big yeah uh thanks to you no not only thanks to you guys you guys have the good content I just helped", "start": 38.34, "duration": 17.818}
{"chunk": "shine a little light on it hey man all we're trying to do is is help people with this game um but yeah more staff more students it's awesome it's good yeah good problem", "start": 47.219, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "to have sweet so let's talk a little bit about a really cool concept that I've talked about it before you guys talk", "start": 56.219, "duration": 15.722000000000001}
{"chunk": "about it a lot and that is the sacrum move sacred move so what is the sacred move well first off shout out Luke", "start": 63.6, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "brackey on sacred move sacrum is your tailbone so in essence what we're looking at is just how it's moving like obviously into the backswing but in", "start": 71.82, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "transition and then through the strike I think it's a great point to look at because for a lot of years especially like back in like the 90s and early", "start": 80.88, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "2000s everybody was talking about the belt buckle and how the belt buckle needs to rotate and face the Target and so we're looking at like anterior side", "start": 89.52, "duration": 15.899999999999999}
{"chunk": "like our face on front side and one of my favorite views and I think one of your favorite views is just look at students and how they're moving is", "start": 97.02, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "posterior view rear view heck yeah I love to film from behind just so I can see how things are operating yeah exactly which I mean you see like how", "start": 105.18, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "the pelvis is moving how that sacrum is moving how it ties into the spine which is something we're going to chat about today as well how", "start": 113.939, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "the ribs are operating you just see like this really cool image from back there yep um and in essence what we're saying is that the sacrum", "start": 121.619, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "at some point needs to move quite dramatically away from the Target in fact our longest hitters that you see like on the PGA tour or live now are", "start": 129.119, "duration": 16.822000000000003}
{"chunk": "guys that move their sacrum the most from like transitions so somewhere in like the P 4.5 P5 range and then all the", "start": 138.12, "duration": 15.459999999999999}
{"chunk": "way through the hit so through like the P 6.537 range it's moving a ton for the big Ballers so when we say it's moving which way is it moving for those at home", "start": 145.86, "duration": 19.459}
{"chunk": "is are they are they moving more forward or is the or is it reversing course and going back where it came from yes and", "start": 154.92, "duration": 15.821000000000002}
{"chunk": "even beyond that so it's moving forward so I guess I'll just demonstrate let's do a little demo so this little belt loop right here okay that is that's", "start": 163.08, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "pretty much right where our sacrum is and at the start from right here in the backswing I'm going to go ahead and move and as I'm moving and turning here the", "start": 172.8, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "sacrum is going to move towards the Target in the backswing now you'll see this in Rory where they like this re-centering phase from probably P3 ish", "start": 182.4, "duration": 19.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "all the way to P5 they might actually move the sacrum even more towards the target as they're finishing up this load phase yeah and then from there as they", "start": 191.28, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "start to turn out of there you notice that that sacrum starts to move away from the target as they get into the strike and then eventually obviously they're going to peel out out", "start": 199.56, "duration": 20.04}
{"chunk": "of there but from P1 all the way until roughly P5 that sacrum is moving towards the Target and then it dramatically", "start": 208.26, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "moves away from it into the strike curls around behind it yep I mean there's this talk about like the Pivot Point", "start": 217.86, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "shoot there's like endless amounts of pivot Points there's not really one pivot point in the swing that's exactly the pit where the pivot point is actually is changing places constantly", "start": 226.5, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "as well 100 percent and I think um let's see if we had like well we'll do this like if we're looking at our pelvis so if my pelvis is sitting like", "start": 235.739, "duration": 15.479000000000003}
{"chunk": "this and somehow we just had like a bird's eye view right here well this is good so like we would have in essence that would be belt buckle and this would", "start": 244.319, "duration": 19.380000000000003}
{"chunk": "act as the sacrum so if I move this this way so from the camera angle we'd have a bird's eye view as I'm turning into the backswing that way right there goes the", "start": 253.439, "duration": 19.862}
{"chunk": "sacrum starts to rotate or the pelvis is rotating and it's going to move towards the target well where's the belt buckle going away from the target away from this in essence the pivot point is", "start": 263.22, "duration": 18.419}
{"chunk": "somewhere in the middle of the of the pelvis right then we would re-center there's into P5 right and then from here if we're really rotating there goes the", "start": 272.88, "duration": 18.779999999999998}
{"chunk": "sacrum it's going to spit it out away from the target if you have again in my opinion I think in your opinion a proper pivot in the pelvis yes", "start": 282.66, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "the lead sides putting on the brakes here and not continuing to float this way then that sacrum is going to naturally yeah turn and go back behind you exactly what what creates that", "start": 291.6, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "sacral move in in your opinion that's a blend of a lot of things so I don't think anything moves in a golf swing independently I think everything's tied", "start": 300.96, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "together as a system yep so the lead leg is definitely putting on the brakes the Torso is starting to unwind and bend", "start": 309.9, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "this leg's got to straighten makes the sacrum go around behind you it's all a big system-wide thing nothing's doing anything independent of", "start": 318.9, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "anything else yeah you bring up a really really cool point there too because just our culture and golf instruction all those great positions that we see are", "start": 327.3, "duration": 19.801}
{"chunk": "because of a system and I think it's really important for everybody to know no matter how quality a player you are that you can overdo or under do anything", "start": 336.9, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "and you're just looking to like kind of get in between the bookends so you feel right as an athlete and how much of one thing one athlete needs versus another", "start": 345.419, "duration": 15.899999999999999}
{"chunk": "athlete we all vary slightly for various reasons we don't all hold the golf club the same so the face conditions are different so we can't all move exactly", "start": 352.919, "duration": 16.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "the same way so yeah sacrum move move it away from the target after P5 here we go so let's walk everybody through a good", "start": 361.08, "duration": 15.298}
{"chunk": "Elite golf school drill for teaching the sacred move yeah absolutely so I think what would be really cool just to see this go ahead and just make a backswing", "start": 368.759, "duration": 15.602}
{"chunk": "so you notice there when Milo makes a backswing he does this really well how that sacred move towards the Target now go ahead and land like you like you talk", "start": 377.1, "duration": 15.058}
{"chunk": "about there you go so now you can definitely see like all the way into impact at p7 that that sacrum dramatically moved away so go back to uh", "start": 384.419, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "address if you could for a smile good and in general Milo's sacrum is right over the top of the stripe or this crack right here between both mats okay so go", "start": 392.16, "duration": 16.58}
{"chunk": "ahead and make a backswing whoa so you'll see that that sacrum is now on this side it's over this mat now float into P5 there you go excellent now", "start": 400.56, "duration": 18.34}
{"chunk": "you see that it actually went further that way that's our fully loaded phase right there now from right here as he works into impact you'll see how that", "start": 409.74, "duration": 18.781}
{"chunk": "sacrum just peels out of there and works dramatically away from the target it's a big move from like P5 all the way to p7 it's a huge move it's a dramatic move so", "start": 419.1, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "this is one of the exercises that we really like to do Milo where you're just grabbing yep so I'm going to go ahead and hold you right here go ahead and hit one at like 50 you're actually going to", "start": 427.56, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "hit a ball here you guys watch out over there this could go anywhere okay when you're ready yeah", "start": 436.139, "duration": 16.981}
{"chunk": "so all I'm doing is pulling Milo both of those belt loops away from the Target and really it's a curve it's a curved path but the you probably felt", "start": 444.0, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "that pressure when I did that a little bit yeah yeah I mean you move really well already so you're probably not going to feel a ton of pressure go ahead and hit one again", "start": 453.84, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "it's so nice foreign obviously a super skilled mover when it comes to the systems that we like to see there's certain athletes that we work", "start": 463.319, "duration": 19.463}
{"chunk": "work with that are like super early early extenders right like yeah they start extending some of them start extending like right off of P1 right and", "start": 479.46, "duration": 18.418}
{"chunk": "then just continue to do so in in the world I'm in with mostly older players everybody's extending right from the get-go it's extension", "start": 488.699, "duration": 16.561999999999998}
{"chunk": "extension extension extension extension it just keeps going toward the ball yeah right right you just crash it in there now you don't have any room and that just creates all kinds of chaos but even", "start": 497.22, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "for some of our our players that move really well into into the backswing one of their big hit mechanisms or hip patterns is like just rotating and", "start": 506.58, "duration": 18.181}
{"chunk": "laterally drifting that pelvis towards the target yeah and it just crashes their ribs it kind of gets the golf club in an okay hit position but then through", "start": 515.58, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "the strike it's like anybody they wind up shallowing the golf club by tilting their whole body this way exactly and then the low point is", "start": 523.74, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "yeah hard to manage so go ahead and show that like while we have this camera angle right here like go ahead and like you're gonna hit one out of the bay actually so we can hit one that way yep", "start": 532.5, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "so we're gonna do it wrong these work yeah so this is the wrong so go into uh go into P4 and then that there you go exactly so go ahead and do that again it", "start": 540.6, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "hurts yeah it hurts right so just up here so we'll see that and we'll see this start to rotate out that way right and it just whacks the whole thing out", "start": 549.72, "duration": 15.42}
{"chunk": "right it's just and it's so common everybody I see what I really see a lot of is people drift into the the trail side like this so that they don't", "start": 557.7, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "actually get their sacrum to move toward the target in the backswing I see a lot of this yeah and now they've got to push out of this Trail side yes and that's what they wind up with", "start": 566.22, "duration": 19.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "exactly it's super interesting because like the center of mass and the ribs then and the center of mass of the pelvis are just countering one another it's teeter-totter yeah we just have to", "start": 575.519, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "do that because we don't want to fall over right if I have my center of mass in my in my pelvis moving forward in the center of mass and my ribs moving forward I'm off balance I'm gonna fall", "start": 584.459, "duration": 19.499000000000002}
{"chunk": "over right so that same same action happens or same Theory happens if I move my pelvis away from the target yeah then", "start": 593.339, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "your rib is going to tilt that way yeah to just keep you in just general human yep I feel like I'm going to make some speed now I've got to shift my lower", "start": 601.98, "duration": 15.659}
{"chunk": "body this way and my upper body has to it's just super whacked it's just a bad system at the end of the day it's just a really bad bad system yeah so yeah", "start": 609.899, "duration": 16.562}
{"chunk": "that's uh I think a really simple exercise to do I mean even at home you could put your your buns right up against a wall and and as you make a", "start": 618.12, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "move I mean what we're wanting is a little bit more depth and what the wall is actually going to allow for but you can definitely feel the right cheek for", "start": 626.279, "duration": 15.541}
{"chunk": "a right-handed player the trail cheek working away from the Target right or towards the target rather and then in", "start": 634.08, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "that transition you could feel it slide away from the Target and that's going to put you in some pretty good general movement patterns I like to have players move like an inch and a half two inches", "start": 641.7, "duration": 18.480000000000004}
{"chunk": "away from the wall and then in transition create that depth and make the pelvis slide that way they're actually creating a little bit of depth you just made that drill even better", "start": 650.82, "duration": 17.698}
{"chunk": "yeah so yep absolutely sacred move it away move it away one more time from down the line and Riley you're going to move me through the same motion yep", "start": 659.279, "duration": 18.241999999999997}
{"chunk": "exactly you ready ready when you are so which direction does that feel like I'm pulling you feels like you're", "start": 669.12, "duration": 17.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "pulling me kind of away from the ball and away from the target yeah kind of this way yeah yeah yeah yeah that's perfect so it's not like", "start": 679.26, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "humans like to think just in lines right we don't like to think in shapes and curves so I'm not just pulling like you just said away from the Target only it's", "start": 687.18, "duration": 18.539}
{"chunk": "like you said it's it's a way immediately and then I'm sweeping you out of there that way circle like this yep exactly so this energy is going this", "start": 697.079, "duration": 16.261}
{"chunk": "way and the club's going that way spitting it out that's exactly right so that's even better like what a great image that is because once you get into that fully loaded phase around P5", "start": 705.48, "duration": 20.399}
{"chunk": "to get the club head spit out on its curve Target side we need the center of mass of the pelvis to be moving away and that's its counter mechanism to actually", "start": 714.959, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "shoot the energy out otherwise it's just a big block you're going to work hard and not hit it anywhere no fun okay so let Riley let's let's", "start": 723.959, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "wrap this up and kind of just put a bow on it for everybody so what are the keys here to take away well big keys are", "start": 732.06, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "I mean just understanding where the sacrum is moving is one of many pieces to this entire system as you brought up", "start": 739.98, "duration": 15.599000000000002}
{"chunk": "right so I think it's just a really good point in space to look yeah because we see a whole lot of really good stuff there so first takeaway sacrum needs to move", "start": 748.079, "duration": 17.161}
{"chunk": "towards the Target in the backswing and I think and then maybe just a tick more toward it in the transition phase to P5 exactly and that's cool what does that", "start": 756.66, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "do for us yeah so that one that re-centers us and there's a lot of different ways to recenter we have preferred ways for sure and some stuff", "start": 765.3, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "that we're going to talk about in in ribs where the center of mass and the ribs here in just a sec too but in general there's a loading phase which is", "start": 774.54, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "from P1 to P5 and P5 being honey hole if you watch some of our other our other videos um but that is the the fully loaded phase in the golf swing and so in", "start": 781.92, "duration": 18.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "essence the sacrum for most players is moving towards the target during all of that phase all the way to P5 and then from P5 to p7 it's the unloading phase", "start": 792.12, "duration": 18.419999999999998}
{"chunk": "it's the unload it's the start of the unloading phase so now we're we're peeling that sacrum away to sling the club out and that's an easy way to get rid of energy in the golf swing awesome", "start": 801.779, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "wait a that's a really good way to explain it so hope you guys like this video if you did hit the like And subscribe come visit Riley and his crew", "start": 810.72, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "at Elite they have an awesome you guys have awesome social media platforms and lots and lots of good information so come visit them come visit us as well", "start": 819.12, "duration": 17.801000000000002}
