{"chunk": "the body [Music] okay henry so what in the world are you talking about", "start": 9.2, "duration": 17.048}
{"chunk": "i was up late last night i had this crazy idea and i i think i've mentioned this one to you before though is that when i feel level or", "start": 20.0, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "on top of the golf ball where you can really compress it especially with irons it feels like my body my upper center my", "start": 28.8, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "shoulders chest feels like i'm i'm over the top i'm hitting a a fade basically yeah so your top so your pivot pattern is", "start": 36.559, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "kind of like this right yeah now it's really more symmetrical now do i ever really quite get there no we don't in reality we wouldn't want", "start": 46.559, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "this right side coming out we want it to just go turn back turn through with symmetry right yes but for somebody like me who", "start": 54.8, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "has especially over you know been more lateral slightly tilted from underneath so your tendency would be to be this way", "start": 62.96, "duration": 20.479}
{"chunk": "yes okay so for you this feeling of fade the body evens you out makes me more symmetrical", "start": 72.159, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "yeah okay okay now i was thinking about though my my hands and arms if i were to fade the body", "start": 81.439, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "like this and my hands and arms were to also come like this that would be no bueno that would be really steep from the", "start": 92.079, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "outside you'd hit like nasty pulls and slices so that to me feels like with the arms i'm going from", "start": 100.799, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "way high up and out to down and in narrow yeah you're gonna get a gentleman might be like this oh chicken wing yeah", "start": 108.88, "duration": 20.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "so that is a fade body and fade arms that feels like a fade it's almost like a bunker shot feeling to me yeah where it's more it's carving across carving", "start": 118.56, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "across yeah so to me that would certainly stall our rotation create a", "start": 128.239, "duration": 16.162}
{"chunk": "lot of dynamic loft high slice city or push city or if you happen to square the face it's a dead yank yeah yeah to me that seems", "start": 135.84, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "like the match up then would be if i'm more making that symmetrical turn which may feel a little bit over the top that's", "start": 145.76, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "sort of that fade feel the body my arms still have to almost be more of a draw pattern where they're working more from", "start": 154.319, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "the side of me and then getting slung off almost a little bit out to the right yeah so if i if i make this move right", "start": 162.72, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "here you can see you guys on camera i'm swinging way out to the right with my arms and then i add that over the top feeling now my hands get slung", "start": 171.36, "duration": 20.24}
{"chunk": "on this nice arc that we're looking for more symmetrical so that could be a really good feel if you want to add rotation so in order to feel", "start": 181.04, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "that draw the arms what you're feeling is your arms are staying over here to the right yeah to the right to the right to the right and then naturally momentum", "start": 189.92, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "slings them out away from you like this right so to the right to the right to the right swing out away from you and they're long out here well that would match up really nicely", "start": 198.48, "duration": 20.56}
{"chunk": "yeah to that rotation now one one key thing i want to bring up though and we actually just had a golf school in san diego for our academy members", "start": 208.159, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "and you and i had kind of a a point where we had a few students working on a similar thing and we noticed it was popping up and that was", "start": 218.08, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "they were trying to shallow the club or get from the inside by dropping the arms excessively okay so i think it's important to understand is", "start": 227.04, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "that even though this the arms are maybe more of that draw pattern from into out it's not necessarily low to high like we're not trying to drop and", "start": 236.319, "duration": 16.401999999999997}
{"chunk": "then well it wouldn't be possible if your body is doing what we're asking it to do right so if you actually were feeling this in your arms but your body was", "start": 245.12, "duration": 17.598999999999997}
{"chunk": "doing this the hands would stay almost up a little bit yeah so the only the thing that would be really bad is draw the body and the arms then you'd", "start": 253.2, "duration": 15.520999999999999}
{"chunk": "get this look let's again it goes back to the match-up where the body needs to feel more centered or", "start": 261.44, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "maybe for some of you guys a little bit on top and then the arms need to feel like they're to a little bit just staying up and to the right of you and then you can", "start": 269.12, "duration": 18.398}
{"chunk": "get a little bit of that shaft circling with the wrists we talk about okay so let's hit a few milo let's see if we can maybe what i'll do", "start": 277.919, "duration": 17.682}
{"chunk": "i think we've done this before is i've kind of held up your left arm a little bit in transition yeah so first let's let's show them the body", "start": 287.28, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "move with a club or no club um how about how about just make a backswing and then just let's leave the whole", "start": 294.4, "duration": 15.678}
{"chunk": "system here and let's make that little over the top body move we're talking about so the fade feel so now see what would happen is if the hands went like", "start": 303.039, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "that with you yep right so we're going to learn to circle that thing a little bit okay so now we're going to do the same body feel and i'm going to leave", "start": 311.039, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "this arm up for a second okay so that club can still come from the inside and you can rotate matches up right yep and i'm basically going to", "start": 318.96, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "just hold your left arm for a second you're going to go nice and slow and let that that draw feel start with your arms while you're turning out of the way okay", "start": 326.56, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "the way we want okay arms are going to feel like they're going this is getting held up there for just a second yep okay okay", "start": 335.44, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "now you get that little push draw okay so that's a cool feel let's try another one now i got to do it on my own", "start": 345.6, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "i want to feel my body moving that way my arm's moving that way to match with", "start": 354.4, "duration": 18.038}
{"chunk": "it oh that was pretty milky two fields that match up you can get them right well i think a lot of you guys at home are so worried about", "start": 364.4, "duration": 19.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "getting this low left exit we see it all the time they're wanting to get that club to move back around them to the left but they're coming from the wrong place", "start": 386.56, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "and that we still want the club the club exiting left is all just a byproduct of you turning yeah", "start": 395.759, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "and the club being moved by your turn around the ark you don't pull the club around to the left yeah and we as you always mentioned we want", "start": 403.68, "duration": 17.118}
{"chunk": "to sling the club and and extend our arms into the finish so they can get slung by our turn", "start": 413.199, "duration": 16.562}
{"chunk": "versus trying to control things and pull them in pull it left yeah exactly all right guys well there you go draw the arms fade the body", "start": 420.96, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "kind of a crazy match-up but it really can work for rotation it's a little bit different but something you guys can try out at home and see if it fits into what", "start": 430.319, "duration": 18.281}
{"chunk": "you've been thinking cool", "start": 438.4, "duration": 3.96}
