{"chunk": "kind of two trains of thoughts on this subject throughout the history of golf really, right? If we start as simple with something like a ball you put between your arms,", "start": 15.679, "duration": 20.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "right? Well, there's also Hogan's train of thought where he would put a belt around his elbows. Now, we had this discussion before this video and there's", "start": 25.439, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "a I think there's a lot of questions that come up. Okay. So, with a belt that keeps your arms in, right? It holds you in. Holds you in. Pins you in. Yeah.", "start": 35.44, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "So, what whether you know it or not, a lot of times your subconscious starts to fight out against it. Yes. And then when you take the belt", "start": 43.84, "duration": 15.521}

{"chunk": "eventually, aren't your arms going to want to kind of fight out of that if you do it wrong? Yeah. So, if you're feeling a tension like you pushing", "start": 60.559, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "against it, you'll probably push this way as you start down. Okay. If you can swing with the belt on your arms and not feel any tension.", "start": 68.72, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So you feel like that it's not helping you or hurting you. Yes. Then it could probably be beneficial. Okay. And then vice versa, if you put a", "start": 77.28, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "ball between your arms, now you're in your your tension levels more inward, right? You're pushing in to keep that ball secured here.", "start": 86.08, "duration": 20.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "When you take the ball away, aren't your arms going to be more apt to stay there or even work more inward? Yes, I would", "start": 96.32, "duration": 16.718}
{"chunk": "say for sure. Okay. So, this is this is just really interesting because it it goes into how we're trying to develop", "start": 104.479, "duration": 17.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "certain feels in our golf swing, right? Whether it's the ball or a belt, uh certain training aids, but we're also going to talk about using resistant", "start": 113.28, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "bands, which maybe you guys have seen again other coaches or players use where we're talking about, you know, whether it's keeping depth, right? And so often", "start": 122.0, "duration": 20.32}

{"chunk": "where they want them to go could work that the player is actually fighting that and so they might get more of what they don't want. Yeah.", "start": 140.8, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "So another example was if you could just take it up to the top of the back swing for me. We brought up this one is okay I want you to feel your start your down", "start": 148.64, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "swing. I'm going to hold this up for a second. Okay. So you feel your left arm move across your chest a little bit more. Yeah. But I also felt pressure down. You were", "start": 157.76, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "fighting me. So the question is if I did that as a feel, you know, we made 10 swings with that feel, would your arms really want to stay up", "start": 165.76, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "or would they eventually keep wanting to let go more? So I think if you do it wrong like what I did there, I actually fought into you.", "start": 173.84, "duration": 16.558}
{"chunk": "Now, if I was doing this correctly, what I would have the player feel is I would have them feel like they turn into it and they don't put any resistance into the coach.", "start": 182.159, "duration": 16.402}
{"chunk": "It feels like the arms are actually going up, not down. So, what I could do is say vice versa here again, back", "start": 190.8, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "swing, I want you to feel like you're pushing into my hand in the down swing. That's totally different. Right now, you're pushing up. So, I guess the", "start": 198.239, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "question becomes which is the right way and I'm not sure we have an exact answer for our viewers. I guess it kind of", "start": 207.599, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "depends. I think it depends on what you're trying to get. I think in the beginning both can be functional. Mhm. Like if I've got a player who's tending", "start": 216.56, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "to go like this Yeah. or when they make a back swing their pelvis shifts this way and then they get to the top and they're stuck over here on their right foot and they spin. It", "start": 223.92, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "might actually be beneficial for me to take a hold of them. Yeah. And move them where I want them to go. Right. But over time, as they figure out", "start": 233.36, "duration": 16.478}
{"chunk": "how to do that, then it might be beneficial for me to fight them. It's just like working out. When you're working out and you're training a a", "start": 241.439, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "certain movement, you're trying to build up some strength in that movement. You're applying more and more weight resistance against you, right? Yes.", "start": 249.76, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "But on the flip side, we talked about sprinters, right? how some sprinters will run through sand just like that. Build up that resistance, build up", "start": 257.919, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "strength, but then they'll run down a mountain as fast as they can go. Yep. Right. So, again, which one is it? Cuz one, on one hand, they're getting an", "start": 266.479, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "advantage. On the other hand, I think both are needed from time to time cuz sometimes you need the resistance to make you stronger", "start": 275.199, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "and other times you need to just let go and go fast. I guess the best analogy in our sport would be what you see with", "start": 282.88, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "speed training and speed sticks is you have a heavier weight, right? To build up some strength, some mass, probably slow you down. Theoretically,", "start": 292.24, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "you can't you don't swing the heavy one as fast as you swing the light one usually. And then you go back to a light one. You swing as fast as you can, right? So you", "start": 302.16, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "you feel your body go faster. Everything's faster. So you kind of got to maybe train both and figure out what works best for you.", "start": 310.16, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So you have to build power, more strength, but you also have to build the quick Yes. Quick. You got to build that quickness. Yeah.", "start": 317.759, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "Now, at times when we're going to do some exercises here to talk about how to put more force, I actually think that when you're learning how to develop more", "start": 326.08, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "force, you need resistance. Mhm. But when you're learning how to move, you need guidance. Guidance. That's a good word. I like", "start": 334.56, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "that. So, let's do it. Cool. Let's show the guy, the folks at home, what we're talking about. All right, Milo. So, I got a really light resistance band, but we're going to make", "start": 342.479, "duration": 18.882}
{"chunk": "it a little more taut as I get it wrapped around you. And we're going to do a couple different exercises here. Okay. And something again, maybe our viewers", "start": 352.32, "duration": 18.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "are have seen at home before. Okay? So, let's start with the back swing. Okay? cuz you know we're we're working", "start": 361.12, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "on getting this right hip a little deeper right getting in our bends and and making a good turn off the ball.", "start": 370.479, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "So we're going to make sure we get wound up and we start to reenter probably a little bit in the back swing. Yeah. And some of the pressure trace", "start": 377.919, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "here right in your right foot. What's going on with our our pressure? Right. We kind of get into this right foot and then sort of back into the the heel a", "start": 385.68, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "little bit and that pushes this upper center back a little bit. Right. Makes us centers us back up and gets us wandering back to the middle. Yeah. Okay. So, I'm going to wrap this", "start": 394.8, "duration": 19.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "around. You feel like a doctor today. Sweet. Okay. So, let me see if I can get this set up the way I want.", "start": 404.08, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "So you can see I brought the one handle through the other and I'm actually going to get feel right to you. Yep. I'm actually going to get over We talked", "start": 414.08, "duration": 18.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "about doing it over here where I'm more in line with the camera. I would say a little bit more on like that angle. Yeah, right there.", "start": 423.12, "duration": 15.119000000000002}
{"chunk": "So what he's going to do is I'm not going to be pulling quite yet. And again, this is the guided way, right? So I'm going to as he makes this back", "start": 431.759, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "swing, I'm actually going to get a little more over here. Start pulling me. I'm going to start to pull on this just a little bit. He's going to feel it pull his right hip back.", "start": 440.319, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "It's pulling my right hip back. And it's actually starting to make my right hip go to you. So, I can feel it taking me to you.", "start": 448.4, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So, the question becomes, if we did this for a long period of time, would you actually fight that more? Maybe sway more?", "start": 455.599, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "I don't think so. Okay. I don't I don't think I would. So, what else are you feeling here when", "start": 465.199, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "I do this? I'm feeling a a bigger wind up than I normally would get. So, my my right hip feels like it's getting more around.", "start": 475.919, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "Yeah. Pressure is going into the inside of my right foot, and I feel like it's when you put that force on me, it's recentering me back to the middle pretty", "start": 486.56, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "early. Pretty early. Okay. So, for someone who's really struggling with a sway or slide off the ball, this", "start": 495.28, "duration": 17.599000000000004}
{"chunk": "might be a good feel. Yeah, for sure. Okay. So, let's go the opposite side now. Let's do one on impact", "start": 503.84, "duration": 22.241}
{"chunk": "or clearing the lead side through the hidden area. So, I'm you good?", "start": 514.32, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "Yep. So, I feel like my force vector is in the right place. Yeah, it's pulling me right. It's pulling that right that left hip back around like that.", "start": 523.76, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So, I'm not pulling very hard, but it's it's helping him feel the sensation, wouldn't you say?", "start": 532.56, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So, it's kind of the guidance I was talking about earlier. This is a little guidance on how to move. Yeah. Is it going to make me faster? Maybe", "start": 541.6, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "not. Yeah. Now, let's talk a little bit about well, let's talk about the opposite. What if I was pulling you in the", "start": 550.8, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "opposite direction, right? So, let's say let's go this way this time. So, again, so for let's do impact. Okay. So, I on", "start": 558.0, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "that one I just pulled you that way to help clear your lead side. Okay. Now, I'm going to help I'm going to fight you. All right. So, here's one where I'm actually fighting", "start": 566.56, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "him. Now, he can't hit a golf ball cuz it's resistance band. We know that. But this is a good way again an exercise where I'm resisting", "start": 575.12, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "that hip clearance, that lead side clearance. And we see Dr. Scott Lynn uses this a lot with students when he's working with them on swing catalyst to create more", "start": 586.56, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "force. The way he'll do it, we just take this off for a second. He'll wrap this band. Go ahead and take that, wrap it around", "start": 594.959, "duration": 19.041}

{"chunk": "to go, pull. And now I can really feel Yeah. what it's like to use my front side. Push back.", "start": 614.079, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So there's definitely no guidance here. There's no help. No, this is restriction. This is more of a a resistance. Yeah. So this is something again in a", "start": 622.64, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "gym would be a great workout. You know, just like if you were doing a bicep curl, right? Um, you're there's", "start": 632.0, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "resistance there. So, you're resist you you're getting pulled against and you got to really open up and get deep with it. And then once you pull that", "start": 640.32, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "resistance away, you better believe it's going to be a little easier. Oh, yeah. If that goes away, it's going to feel like, wa, this wants to just go around on me.", "start": 647.92, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "Yeah, for sure. So, two different ways to train this. We can guide. Yes. Or we can resist. Yep.", "start": 656.56, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "I think both have their place in the coaching. Yeah. Let's do one more, Milo. I got another resistance band here.", "start": 666.32, "duration": 15.199}

{"chunk": "Now, I felt a little pull back. Okay. Little more. That was good. Yeah. Now try to Can you grab one side and", "start": 710.399, "duration": 15.520999999999999}
{"chunk": "pull and then pull the other? Yeah. Oh, that felt different. That works pretty good, actually. So, this could be", "start": 720.8, "duration": 15.279}

{"chunk": "Uh-huh. Okay. So, vice versa. Now, let's drop the club cuz you're not going to be able to swing. Okay. So, if I did it this way, you're", "start": 739.12, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "going to have to get lower. Good. You just sort of hugged yourself or made a swing. Now I feel like I have to really push", "start": 748.639, "duration": 15.037999999999998}
