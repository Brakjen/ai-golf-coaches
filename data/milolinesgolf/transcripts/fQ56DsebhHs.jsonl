{"chunk": "[Music] hey guys welcome out to Superstition Mountain today we're going to talk about how we can counter our driver", "start": 27.34, "duration": 17.668}
{"chunk": "to demolish the drives something we've done on this channel before have a kettlebell or we've used a bucket of balls some type of weight just to kind", "start": 38.7, "duration": 18.06}
{"chunk": "of get a sense of the sequence of events that are happening the pressure shifts and how important this is to creating that flow and building that flow up into", "start": 47.879, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "speed and hitting driver where you can have that you know it's like these guys on tour they have such a freewheeling action right and a lot of that is just because they're just being naturally", "start": 56.219, "duration": 18.722}
{"chunk": "athletic but for a lot of you at home maybe we need to add some exercises like this in to help kind of feel that now we've done videos before we did the", "start": 65.28, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "Zombie Walk video it was really good but I got the Kettlebell out again today so why don't we just talk a little bit about this countering action so I'll", "start": 74.64, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "just start making some little counters first let's start with the ball not moving what do we have to do to to energize and get the ball to start to move what do you have to do with your", "start": 82.979, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "mass I kind of feel like I have to go a little towards the lead side so you go a little you go a little lead side and then you go pretty heavy Trailside right", "start": 91.619, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "yeah so it's kind of just a little shift left or A Little Fall left and then as I'm doing that I actually feel like my right heel is coming off the ground", "start": 98.759, "duration": 19.141}
{"chunk": "slightly so if I do it face on you see that right heel and we actually see that I just posted a video on Instagram with Dustin Johnson doing just", "start": 109.02, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "that doing a heel tap and that was his trigger yep to get going in the backswing we see this with a lot of great players so it's boom", "start": 118.079, "duration": 15.78}
{"chunk": "and it's not like all the pressure is going right into that heel it's really still more middle of the foot but that's just showing that there's a little bit of force going left and then back to the", "start": 126.479, "duration": 17.722}
{"chunk": "right yeah so that kind of gets me going that gets it swinging to the right whoosh now as this kettlebell is going", "start": 134.94, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "up this backswing side you have to start to counteract the weight because it wants to pull you yeah I don't if you keep going to the right you go to the right right", "start": 143.7, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "so you're going to have to counter it and start to shift pressure back to the forward side so even on these little short swings you can see that so I can I'm just going to do a few and then I'll", "start": 152.94, "duration": 20.66}
{"chunk": "slow it down so you can see it at home you see how the change from down the line too the flex in my legs is changing", "start": 162.0, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "so at first in the backswing my right leg is losing a little Flex a little Flex not straightening not locking out but losing a little flex and the left", "start": 177.18, "duration": 19.859}
{"chunk": "leg is increasing in the backswing now in transition the left leg actually increases a little more and then it reverses now my left leg starts to", "start": 186.959, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "straighten out straighten out a little bit Yeah again not really locking out so you can see that chain of events let me make a little bigger now", "start": 196.019, "duration": 17.979}
{"chunk": "you can really see now I'm even incorporating a little bit of my upper center now I'm going to even step a little forward as I do it", "start": 206.64, "duration": 16.540999999999997}
{"chunk": "so that's a really good workout and exercise you can do how heavy is that kettlebell not very heavy whatever you've been working out I've been", "start": 214.8, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "carrying a bag that was pretty heavy I'm cattying what is this 12 kilograms whatever that is 26 pounds that's too heavy to be swinging", "start": 222.54, "duration": 15.86}
{"chunk": "start light but that's a good exercise and I'll link the Zombie Walk video to do that now if you gave me a driver I", "start": 230.12, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "could do the same thing it's going to feel like nothing but I can kind of start it out the target so there's my little left the right heel raising", "start": 238.86, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "and now I can swing it back the other way so now I'm starting to oppose it a little bit and what would you know I actually have", "start": 247.62, "duration": 16.499000000000002}
{"chunk": "a fairly centered action there is some sway but as I increase that motion now we get", "start": 254.459, "duration": 15.721000000000002}
{"chunk": "more rotary right so the initial Parts on both sides are a little more linear but then a lot of it turns into yeah you", "start": 263.16, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "need the linear to create the energy that starts the system moving so if I want to get this thing started I need linear motion linear motion before", "start": 271.02, "duration": 19.74}
{"chunk": "I have too much rotation and then I can wind up and naturally as the momentum of that club starts to move I'm going to need to", "start": 280.32, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "re-center myself for counter that momentum and I do it on both ends so as the club's coming as the club's going up I'm going left", "start": 289.139, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "now the club's coming down and now about here my I've got to start to counter it because it's going to be going that way really fast so you're going to see me", "start": 297.96, "duration": 17.9}
{"chunk": "pushing back so the reason we bring up a wrecking ball is when you you see this Tower with a you know a chain connected", "start": 306.259, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "to this wrecking ball that just demolish this building that Tower is actually countering where that ball is going otherwise what", "start": 315.0, "duration": 16.979999999999997}
{"chunk": "would happen to the tower would fall down boom now we got two things down right so as that weight gets slung back away from the intended target the", "start": 323.58, "duration": 19.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "building the tower starts to shift towards the building now it creates a little tension on that that line and now", "start": 333.3, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "the ball starts to come back yeah this is really where that sequence and the power in our with driver really can come", "start": 341.759, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "from versus you guys moving with the unit together which we see so often you're depriving yourself of all those", "start": 349.02, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "potential slings you could be stretching yeah we talk a lot about the lead arms stretch and transition The Landing the pressure shifts there's", "start": 357.24, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "a lot of power in that motion for sure and it gives you some mechanical advantages as well so you get to use physics to create energy versus just your strength but why don't we do a", "start": 366.36, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "little bit of uh kind of a kettlebell swing with the driver and warm up to a couple drives how about that okay love it yeah so I'm going to start off with", "start": 375.419, "duration": 15.061}
{"chunk": "just some little kind of small ones but really feeling a trigger wind wind", "start": 382.68, "duration": 19.258000000000003}
{"chunk": "so trigger shift wind shift unwind all right let's do that one of those face on okay once I kind of feel how I use my mask to", "start": 390.539, "duration": 19.481}
{"chunk": "get the club energized now I'm going to start letting the lever system play a role in the system as well so when you say the lever system you're", "start": 415.02, "duration": 17.62}
{"chunk": "talking kind of wrists wrists arms so creating angle and letting it go too yeah so I'm going to start creating some angles and letting the letting the", "start": 424.8, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "shifting and unwinding of my body sling those those angles so this will be a little more speed", "start": 433.86, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "and so for those of you that gets stuck at the golf ball this is so cool you can go ahead and hit one more actually", "start": 444.84, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "or get ready to hit one and just watch how Milo starts rocking you start shuffling he's there's a dance", "start": 454.199, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "to this you see this with Lee Trevino you see this with Dustin Johnson a lot of the best players are creating some movement", "start": 462.18, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "so you see how that movement creates that free-flowing freewheeling sequence that we see amongst the long hitters yep", "start": 471.199, "duration": 17.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "you know I really think of Kyle Berkshire so I'll post a video of him and man he's like he's almost creating like a stomping pattern yeah he does and", "start": 481.139, "duration": 19.681}
{"chunk": "he used to be big stars now it's more it's more subtle but it's still same ideas there's even a couple of them now who go", "start": 490.74, "duration": 15.898000000000001}
{"chunk": "yeah I'm gonna lift that front leg like they're pitchers yeah they're getting their whole Mass involved in that it's creating big stretches this wrecking", "start": 499.379, "duration": 18.901000000000003}
{"chunk": "ball move oh it really comes back to is just that same sequence and chain events we always talk about with the pressure shifts and countering or opposing the", "start": 508.259, "duration": 20.519}
{"chunk": "weight that we have even as with a golf club that's pretty light obviously compared to the Kettlebell that I was swinging around you still want to feel", "start": 518.459, "duration": 15.122}
{"chunk": "like there's you're creating a little of that opposite pattern where it's working into you a little bit in transition yeah this club's light but", "start": 526.2, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "when you start moving it fast it's actually creating significant amounts of force all right everyone so thanks for", "start": 534.48, "duration": 15.379000000000001}
{"chunk": "watching make sure you get countering in your golf swing especially with driver let's get moving that thing with good sequence good pressure shifts", "start": 547.32, "duration": 20.101}
{"chunk": "oppose the weight right first and then for one-on-one help make sure you guys come over to mylinesgolf.com where we can help you one-on-one with your games", "start": 557.58, "duration": 17.819000000000003}
