{"chunk": "Mhm. And you'll see like what's weird is this looks okay. This looks way better. [music] Hey guys, we're back with Riley. Good to", "start": 8.8, "duration": 19.581000000000003}
{"chunk": "see you again. Golf School. How you going, man? Yeah, baby. Doing great. And we're talking about sort of three exercises, three trainings you can do for spiral", "start": 21.6, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "line. This is really about more of a rhythmical motion, less tension. That's the big the big key here. Yeah. And I", "start": 30.48, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "think like even on that tension topic, there's tension in parts of it and you're slacked out in others and you're bouncing back and forth from like", "start": 37.84, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "tension to relaxation. Okay. So, let's let's set this up cuz you off camera you kind of showed me this spiral spiral line. We're talking", "start": 46.32, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "about sort of the fascia in our body, right? So, why don't you demonstrate on me? So, I'm like anatomical example. I guess you can kind of show.", "start": 55.039, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "Perfect. That's great. So, the first thing I'm going to do like all of this stuff I really learned from Dr. Luke Brachie. So, we got to throw him in there before we start. We're going to have him on the channel.", "start": 63.6, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "He's going to be on show. Yeah, he's fantastic. So, typical chinesiology, right, is like we would go cut here, cut", "start": 71.76, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "there. Cool. Look, a bicep. When it contracts, it does this. When it relaxes, it does this. Then we go to the next muscle and which is like super intricate,", "start": 80.08, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "time consuming. It's like you look at it as like a system of like pulley clunk is just not not worth your time. We're all about the flow. So we all about the flow up in this", "start": 88.56, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "building. So [laughter] uh spiral lines. So we have all these different like they're called fascial lines, right? But what's cool in our", "start": 97.28, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "musculature, all of the tracks, like in the bicep, the highways go this way, like the grains. Like cut through a steak, right? You cut through it and you see", "start": 105.2, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "all those different strains. That's what we're seeing in the in the in the bicep here and they're going that direction and then they go this direction and this direction and so on and so forth. So", "start": 114.079, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "it's like a system of highways. It's not like we have the grains going this way and then in the forearms they're going here. They're all in the same direction. So that would be a fascial line and the", "start": 122.399, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "arm line. So, we have anterior arm line, we have posterior arm line. Mhm. And we have all these different lines. One of them is the spiral line. And the", "start": 131.52, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "spiral line starts right up here, right in the back of uh of our head. It'll go down underneath our scalp. So, it tracks", "start": 140.4, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "this way. Okay. Now, as you rotate the other way, go ahead. Wraps around under here. Wraps right around under there. Right underneath your booby. Okay. Across on", "start": 148.64, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "an X like this. There's one side that goes this way as well. goes right at top that pointy portion in your pelvis. It's your iliac crest and then runs down", "start": 157.28, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "here. [snorts] Now, this side, like the lower spiral, lower body spiral, I don't like to talk about a whole lot. Like leg action is almost like a", "start": 165.519, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "response of what's going on in our upper spiral. I think often times there's a lot of talk on, okay, like basket drill,", "start": 173.599, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "let this go. A lot of that is just slack. Even though we see that happen, a lot of it is just because of the behavior that the upper spiral is", "start": 181.68, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "commanding. Like this is the conductor, this is the orchestra. And I think for people that watch our channel, you know, we've talked about things with the the leg action, but a", "start": 189.68, "duration": 19.678}
{"chunk": "lot of that has to do with our pressure shifts, too. Yes. Right. So, falling, landing, um pushing into the ground the right way, but that", "start": 199.599, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "has to do with our center as well. Exactly. How that's all matched up. So when we're looking at the spiral to like really simplify this the spiral line if", "start": 208.879, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "we thought about it right up here right underneath the scap crosses underneath and right here to the oat crest that line and this line just imagine a big X", "start": 217.84, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "like if I put duct tape on you those are the upper spirals like like really looking at um our golf swing. So anterior slings [snorts]", "start": 226.4, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "anterior spirals. So, if you get into setup, just right here facing the camera, an easy way to feel this is if back here, right on this scap where it's", "start": 235.36, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "running up here. Yep. I would like players to feel like they're getting this portion of the spiral separating away from this portion", "start": 244.319, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "of the spiral. There you go. And I feel a little bit of a crunch up there. Exactly. And you'll feel this like super stretched. Crazy stretch.", "start": 251.439, "duration": 17.919}

{"chunk": "Okay. Go ahead and use that spiral line, not your arms to go ahead. Not that. Exactly. So, whoop. There you go. So, you'll", "start": 267.759, "duration": 15.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "really feel all that load up. That's a beautiful look right there. So, I feel it even in my glute a little bit, but y right through there. Yep. And so, what you're feeling, this", "start": 275.759, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "is part of the spiral. This is the lower spiral that's on. So all of this when we're talking about that tension model like you're talking about, you're", "start": 284.96, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "creating tension in one spiral and the other spiral is slack. Yeah. So tension in this one, the other one slacks out. Mhm.", "start": 292.24, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "That's just general movement. If you're moving, walking like typical gate patterns, parts of your of your fascia lights up and the other ones slack out and then you'll bounce out of it.", "start": 300.96, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "You bend it like this. You create a stretch one place and slack slack the other side. Okay. So why don't you hold this for a second? This is something we talked", "start": 310.08, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "about too is like if this was a rubber band and I go ahead and kind of stretch this out and I were to let go. Yep. Go ahead and let it go. There you go.", "start": 318.08, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "So now if I really did that hit some kids at school, right? Right. Um but in theory that's what we're doing in our golf swing and in these exercises", "start": 326.0, "duration": 21.68}
{"chunk": "is to is to stretch the right way, right? in a safe way that allows us to use sort of forces as opposed to", "start": 336.08, "duration": 19.119}

{"chunk": "instead of distributing the energy throughout like a line like the spiral which is a massive line fascial line in our body. If you put energy throughout", "start": 364.319, "duration": 18.642000000000003}

{"chunk": "all the time, right? You're putting all the energy in one spot. No good. It's just like when I'm when I first started working out in college,", "start": 382.08, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "I would try to isolate. Y what I began to realize is that one I would if I was just doing bicep curls", "start": 390.72, "duration": 16.16}

{"chunk": "Position one, position two. And that's where that like the positions like if you go up to the top, which I guess that would be typical P4 position", "start": 432.96, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "just to hold that position, you're energizing like the whole system. Yeah. It's not dynamic. It's super static. It's tough to train that way because you", "start": 441.039, "duration": 17.2}

{"chunk": "athletic way to move compared to this position, this position, this position, stale, still stale. I I got to tell a little story about this cuz last night I was at baseball", "start": 457.68, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "practice. And right now I'm letting somebody else coach my kid. Well, my boy, I throw him ground balls. He feels the ground ball", "start": 466.88, "duration": 18.4}

{"chunk": "Yeah, that too. Right. It could have gone one of two ways. Could have. Luckily, it went the way I wanted it to because they saw", "start": 511.199, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "immediately. My boy is actually Yeah. When he did it right, when it was there was bounce in his step and it wasn't like this mechanical thought process. He", "start": 518.88, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "actually has a good arm. when he was doing what they would they had him field it step point your glove throw like", "start": 527.12, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "breaking it into all the pieces he went from being able to throw really hard to could bounce it and rolled it across the infield yeah and the ball's probably going all", "start": 535.04, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "over straight so he loses all precision and all easy speed like gh yeah piece to piece to piece just not a good way to train no", "start": 542.88, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "matter what sport exactly all right so let's get into we did this one movement where we were talking about sort of winding it up right", "start": 550.48, "duration": 18.16}

{"chunk": "Yep. Yep. So, you can um demonstrate this one about how we're trying to make sort of uh these sticks cross, right?", "start": 567.839, "duration": 20.962000000000003}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So, really easy couple of like at home deals. You can either grab a band like the one that we were just talking about, one that's pretty slacked. You", "start": 577.04, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "can wrap it around either, you know, a a table leg on the bottom, so it's kind of on an incline plane of 45 to 30\u00b0 somewhere in there, and do the exact", "start": 585.92, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "same exercise that we were just doing, or get an alignment stick, put it in your belt loops, um, and then grab another alignment stick, or in this", "start": 594.88, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "case, we have a PVC, but you'll notice the distance from the left side of the sticks is the same as the right side of the sticks.", "start": 602.16, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "It's set up. So, we're not set up here or here, right? We're just generally stacked. Now, when you start moving like into the back swing, for example, we", "start": 610.8, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "want those those sticks to intersect fairly early here. So, we're creating this again anterior sling with the", "start": 618.959, "duration": 16.24}

{"chunk": "And one area I talk a lot about is sort of up in here too. A lot of you guys get stiff chin high. You probably heard that before. So softness in the neck", "start": 661.76, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "so that the eyes can be down at the ball the correct way. Yep. Exactly. And that's what's interesting is you'll we'll see guys that are that way. They're actually in right bend", "start": 671.2, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "cuz they're trying to travel level. Not just do we see it. I see it every day all the time. [laughter] All the time. Right. Shows up. That's what they do.", "start": 680.0, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And the problem is is our fascia likes to bounce and it feels like speed. So we'll see guys we", "start": 687.6, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "see it too, Milo. Right. where guys will get into right bend early and then they bounce out and what's that pattern? Well, that's why that's one of the big reasons they do it. Once you go right,", "start": 696.0, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "you're going to go left cuz your body likes to bounce. Yep. And just like we did when you stretch that fascia and let it go, it wants to bounce out of there and get rid", "start": 705.04, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "of that energy. Just that's just general. So, we want it to be able to go in this pattern where we go the opposite of over the top. Yep. Then we've got to get into that", "start": 713.839, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "leftward bend early. Left bend and then we can trade into right hand which you'll see like every highle player there at impact. Every one", "start": 721.92, "duration": 20.4}

{"chunk": "cool cuz it um still body driven, but we actually got a little bit into the wrist, too. I want to point that out as you do this. Perfect. So, what do we got a name for", "start": 739.92, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "this one or? So, this is um David Wack developed this rope system, which I think is is tremendous. So, shout out to", "start": 749.839, "duration": 17.281}

{"chunk": "looks athletic.\" And the other one just doesn't. Yeah. Right. Just the same as if I did this again and I did it with the whole See how the pelvis moves all over? This just", "start": 878.16, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "doesn't look right. So now this like whole unit goes like teeter totters tipping using little bins. Yeah, I kind of I've done a video", "start": 886.88, "duration": 19.360000000000003}
