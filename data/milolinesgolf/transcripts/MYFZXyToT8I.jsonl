{"chunk": "first two places I go to address as we do many times in our schools and with our students we're always teaching a hip hinge type of exercise so that's the", "start": 65.199, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "first place I start and with the with the player I may just have them do the test itself which is going to be something where they're moving their hips backwards and as a coach I'm", "start": 74.6, "duration": 19.200999999999997}
{"chunk": "looking down the line making sure that their pelvis is in fact creating some distance towards translating backwards", "start": 84.56, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "I'm looking for like 6 in to a foot and can they do that without their spine gaining inflexion so the first key to", "start": 91.72, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "this is getting the pelvis to translate back without much spine flexion or rounding people that have problems with", "start": 101.0, "duration": 15.558}
{"chunk": "this you see a lot of bending happening with the upper body and or there's just no weight shift back if that is you and", "start": 108.119, "duration": 17.722}
{"chunk": "you have a hard time moving back like that we me may need to look at Mobility exercises for the hip so first place I", "start": 118.0, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "will start is on your back and doing a leg raise backup like this people that have issues with hip hinge they might", "start": 125.28, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "have length issues on the back of their leg so if you're taking your leg up and you are getting to like this area and it feels like it's got nowhere to go this", "start": 134.72, "duration": 20.56}
{"chunk": "is the first place you need start yeah so the more of these we do right it starts working back back further there's muscles on the front of your leg you may", "start": 144.16, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "experience some cramping with that but that's not a bad thing we need to make the hamstring or the back side of the the leg be inhibited by the muscles on", "start": 153.8, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "the front activating that is a very useful tool we can use to get muscles and tissues to open up hey Milo how'd", "start": 163.319, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "you grab a golf club here and I want you to see and understand why this hamstring length is important for the golf swing", "start": 171.76, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "itself looking at you down the line what we see all the elite players do take this thing up to the top as they start to transition down you see some type of", "start": 179.84, "duration": 21.519}
{"chunk": "squat or hinge we like to call it a flexion of the pelvis yes gaining and hip flexion and what's happening is this", "start": 190.519, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "butt is moving backwards which is then creating more length on the back side of his leg so this is why this is important", "start": 199.599, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "let's say that you're player that cannot do this like leg rise or you have a hard time doing this hinge take one up for me", "start": 208.159, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "and as I want you to make a transition where your pelvis does not actually gain inflexion so you're going to see some type of unloading of the tissue of the", "start": 216.239, "duration": 17.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "back the leg that's going to cause a shooting forward of the pelvis and that's really what we're trying to avoid so a lot of these early extension issues", "start": 225.439, "duration": 18.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "we see are because of patterning loading into tissues that are probably a little bit too tight tight the second you load a tissue it's going to want to unload so", "start": 233.4, "duration": 19.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "if you're loading tissue that only has let's say like this amount of range of motion you load it up and you're going to shoot it back forward so the best", "start": 243.799, "duration": 15.802000000000001}
{"chunk": "players in the world their hips move back they gain hip flexion and most of them or I I would argue all of them can", "start": 251.84, "duration": 16.279}
{"chunk": "do a hip hinge with very good success so every day on the lesson te yeah this is kind of one of the most common things I see and I've created some interesting", "start": 259.479, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "EXC is using hockey sticks I love that and things along those lines to help players feel what it feels like to add that hip hinge or that flexion in", "start": 269.24, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "transition and for everybody it feels extremely strange at first but I find a lot of it has to do with just patterning", "start": 278.88, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "the coordination because a lot of people just that's not something that they're used to doing so even though they may lack Mobility somewhat like me there are", "start": 287.4, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "ways around it if they learn to coordinate it correctly they can get the patterning moving in the right way one thing I've always done in my career is teach this hip hinge and I'm G can I", "start": 295.56, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "borrow this for a second I've always spent a lot of time working on finding the best way to teach this and I've done", "start": 304.36, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "things like putting the golf club on your back it's very hard for some people with shoulder Mobility um maybe using a", "start": 312.88, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "weight in the front but the best way I found is to put a golf club or a stick a dowel whatever on your forehead on your", "start": 320.08, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "stomach and as close to your belt buckle as you can and doing a pattern where you're maintaining those points of contact while you're creating a depth", "start": 329.68, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "backwards early extenders this one's for you AKA just about every one of us we need to learn how to hinge we need to learn how to hinge in different angles", "start": 338.96, "duration": 17.997999999999998}
{"chunk": "we need to learn how to rotate and get back into your hinge so here's back swing and then back into the hinge that we are working on this will take you out", "start": 347.759, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "of early extension allow you to stay down through the ball I think this goes hand hand in hand with the patterning you're talking about cuz if we add rotation let's say we do a one where we", "start": 356.199, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "turn and then hinge that's going to look very similar I think to your hockey stick turn and hinge yes so the way I", "start": 365.479, "duration": 19.122}
{"chunk": "the way I teach it is I we go first straightforward and then we start implementing rotation while hinging and we're going to do that both", "start": 375.56, "duration": 21.12}
{"chunk": "ways and the key with this is is not letting the upper body move out this way in the golf swing if you're ever", "start": 386.639, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "working with the player and their back swing looks like that do you like that hard to recover from there it's hard it's hard to get out of that so we can", "start": 396.039, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "try to influence some of these patterns with hinging or with the work you're doing in the gym if you have the proper like alignment or if you're focusing on", "start": 404.759, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "making sure that it looks similar to what you're working on with your golf swing yeah I actually find players make the fastest progress when they are using", "start": 413.28, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "the same patterns under some load in the gym their muscles get used to it they they actually make progress quicker so Zach everybody's wanting to to get that", "start": 421.44, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "more rotary pattern and you've shown us hip hinge with basically without rotation you've created rotation and hip hinge no hip no rotation and then", "start": 430.12, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "backwards rotation and hip hinge but really there's no rotation happening during it yeah how do we tie this together so the hip hinge portion is the", "start": 439.919, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "gaining inflection or pelvis moving away where the hip separation really happening is going to be like at the top", "start": 448.96, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "with transition and with a with players that lack uh hip dissociation this is a skill that we need to learn so I I've", "start": 456.36, "duration": 18.279}
{"chunk": "worked with some really high level players they come to me and they're really good and their hips don't move at all and it's just kind of shocking to me", "start": 466.68, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "but they have adequate amount of little separation and I've worked with other players that you ask them to do something like this and their pelvis is", "start": 474.96, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "all over the place so this is Step One is just creating an exercise where you have stability where you're in like somewhat of a pelvic tilt and you're", "start": 483.52, "duration": 19.758000000000003}
{"chunk": "creating some separation of the pelvis from the Torso the reason why this is important is because as we go up to the", "start": 493.199, "duration": 16.082}
{"chunk": "top create our little hip hinge and start to get moving into the down swing my shoulders need to be able to lag", "start": 501.12, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "maybe for a decent word or stay a little bit back so that way we can get some shallowing mechanisms to happen and", "start": 510.319, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "that's coming from the pelvis starting to create a little rotation first and one of the interesting things I find if a player winds themselves up and then", "start": 518.599, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "begins to go into flexion naturally the pelvis unwind it wants to unwind some amount mhm and so a lot of that is like", "start": 527.839, "duration": 17.242}
{"chunk": "you get it for free you don't actually if if you move correctly you don't have to try to turn the hips the hips when I flex the hips naturally just turn and", "start": 537.12, "duration": 19.639999999999997}
{"chunk": "res Square so really what I'm looking for is not to gain the ability to rip the hips and turn them I'm just looking", "start": 546.92, "duration": 15.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "for some freedom to do exactly that I'm thinking of it we're trying to get a segment below the Torso to move Freer so", "start": 554.04, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "it's not a pattern where you're trying to whip them and really turn them it's just to create more effortless freedom so Milo I got I got you with this orange", "start": 562.519, "duration": 18.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "stick and I just want you to C try to create a pattern that's similar to your golf swing and what I want everybody to recognize is that go back up to the", "start": 571.56, "duration": 19.319}
{"chunk": "top as you start working down start going down the pelvis is moving backwards the upper body is maintaining", "start": 581.079, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "some uh lag maybe for a better term as you turn down the pelvis creates some freedom and you start to see this little", "start": 588.76, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "Bend happen in the right side of ler that's because the that's upper and lower separating slightly separating yeah the way the spine works as you", "start": 596.76, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "start creating rotation it's facilitated with side Bend so that's why it's important that we have this ability to turn the pelvis so that it allows things", "start": 605.04, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "to naturally Bend in the proper way up the chain all right Zach so you've got three main exercises to accomplish this task these are exercises we do at golf", "start": 613.88, "duration": 19.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "schools you do them with clients here at the at the fitness center kind of walk us through what are the main three exercises so first is going to be creating a pattern that facilitates or", "start": 623.8, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "allows you to create a better hip hinge so it could be like a Mobility exercise for hip flexion so opening up tissues on", "start": 632.44, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "the back sides of your body okay the second is the patterning part of hip hinge itself so we got the stick and we're creating a hinging type of motion", "start": 640.88, "duration": 19.478}
{"chunk": "a flexing type of motion with something that gives you some feedback about your spine not rounding or flexing that's the key and then the Third is being able to", "start": 650.279, "duration": 19.122}
{"chunk": "create some pelvic rotation or separation it's a little disassociation of upper and lower right yeah and this is all it really needs to be it doesn't need to be anything crazy you don't need", "start": 660.24, "duration": 18.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "to go super fast but you do need to have that pattern so the these are three like very simple exercises you guys could do", "start": 669.24, "duration": 15.801}
{"chunk": "on a daily basis maybe spend I don't know 3 to six minutes and I guarantee you're going to start to see some change", "start": 676.88, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "with how your pelvis moves through your downswing and through your golf swing hopefully you like this video and you learned something if you did hit the", "start": 684.68, "duration": 15.799999999999999}
