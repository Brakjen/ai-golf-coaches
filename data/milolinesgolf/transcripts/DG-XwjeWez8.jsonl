{"chunk": "much right it doesn't it doesn't seem like that much 2\u00b0 most average golfers wouldn't be able to tell by their eye what is Li angle just show us what that is just uh the simplest plane if this is", "start": 125.84, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "a a flat plane on the bottom here it would be the angle that this shaft is to the ground on this side here okay so a flatter L angle if the club stayed flat", "start": 134.84, "duration": 15.081}

{"chunk": "would also be close so this angle would be more acute in here okay and so we made this one upright from where it was so standard is generally around 64 65\u00b0", "start": 150.4, "duration": 20.359}
{"chunk": "we've got you just a hair over 65 so your Club is sitting more vertically your shaft is sitting more vertically how's that going to affect things it doesn't seem like it should affect", "start": 160.239, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "things very much well wedges are the one that you want to be in the most accurate with right you know you've got to hit your start line every single time as important is how the wedge interacts", "start": 167.76, "duration": 15.479000000000001}

{"chunk": "much perfect you can see my club path was actually 2.4 to the right into out into out but the ball went like a long", "start": 236.2, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "way left your Club your spin AIS so your ball's axis was tilted eight or 9\u00b0 this way yeah which is a lot so the ball yeah", "start": 243.64, "duration": 15.68}

{"chunk": "it's going to be variable through your wedge set but you'll see good strikes going left you'll see more bad strikes because you'll see the heel digging in", "start": 311.68, "duration": 15.839}

{"chunk": "between your good strike and your manipulated strike yeah yeah it's just crazy the the disparity between those so what happens if you make just your", "start": 347.44, "duration": 15.959000000000001}
{"chunk": "normal swing you just set up standard and you you know you just make a normal swing I don't think there's any way I can hit it straight it's just so far left club path", "start": 355.36, "duration": 17.438}

{"chunk": "because it's something you don't think about fitting people think about bounce right they want to get the right bounce but when you go into a store and you see all these wedges on a wall and it's like", "start": 402.16, "duration": 16.999}
