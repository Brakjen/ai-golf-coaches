{"chunk": "there's not really a pause in your Mot I but what I do see here is a little bit of a outward lift", "start": 117.28, "duration": 16.279}
{"chunk": "so see how your arms are separating from you they're kind of going out this way I hate that so that's the first thing I want to clean up is just get rid of that", "start": 126.36, "duration": 17.321}
{"chunk": "outward motion cuz that gets you really up on top of the plane oh yeah and coming down a little on the Steep side and then that ball has is going to go a", "start": 134.36, "duration": 19.839}
{"chunk": "little bit to the to the left but I like is overall the motion of your body is pretty good you don't invade the space", "start": 144.239, "duration": 16.641}

{"chunk": "out let's find the medium between the two where it's just your arm structure stays pretty intact and we just turn and bend", "start": 270.36, "duration": 17.040000000000003}
{"chunk": "correctly pretty good now every shot I want to have starting to the right of this orange stick that's out here in front of", "start": 280.52, "duration": 15.16}

{"chunk": "but you're turning it back to where your arms are in front of your chest like that the wrists get pretty loaded something like that now if your wrists", "start": 333.039, "duration": 16.441000000000003}

{"chunk": "you wind just a little longer and you can load the wrist but feel like your body winds just a little bit more and longer and then we can drop", "start": 375.4, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "just a little bit more and just a little bit longer in transition okay good rehearsal exaggerated okay", "start": 384.36, "duration": 15.8}

{"chunk": "in Flex it down get out of the way boom look at that okay now let's start winding it a little", "start": 434.879, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "bigger Longer still stay that smooth that much energy but just started lengthening out the wind", "start": 452.16, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "up there we go feel that how long you wound up make that rehearsal flow all the way through so one rehearsal all one", "start": 464.56, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "flowing motion so I want a little bit more energy through it so you're feeling like an actual", "start": 473.199, "duration": 21.0}
{"chunk": "motion okay so wind wind wind it's pretty good you feel like your arms are just going around because you get you tend to go just don't understand", "start": 481.96, "duration": 18.918}
{"chunk": "what it's causing it or how much to shut it off just not up just don't feel any up and I do it everywhere it's in short game it's in sand trap like it's just", "start": 496.479, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "lit well it's cuz you you built a pattern so when you build a pattern it kind of shows up everywhere but look at this motion if we can just clean up that", "start": 504.96, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "arm lift we've got some really awesome stuff cuz look at how your body is moving holy cow yeah you don't feel like you're turning at all look at you turn", "start": 513.68, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "yeah it's beautiful looks like a tour pro and look how shallow it comes down it's like oh killing it it's beautiful great golf swing I would just love to", "start": 523.959, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "get rid of see how your hands have just a little bit of that I didn't see it okay they're kind of coming into to me too much yeah", "start": 532.04, "duration": 16.480000000000004}
{"chunk": "they come they're up and out in front of you and then they go just a little bit this way in the transition I'd rather them just be here back out in front here", "start": 540.44, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "okay back out in front ooh tasty yeah that was really good he gets", "start": 549.76, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "a little that was that was nice oh yeah good you feel that yeah that looked much more structured but", "start": 559.839, "duration": 20.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "it's still loose yeah but it's like away from but a lot of great golfers talk about the swing being from here to here that first part of the", "start": 570.48, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "takeway if they can just set it and get it right feel like it's in front of them it's in control face good game over starting wind up it's done that's how I", "start": 579.64, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "felt but mine was getting out here and doing all kind it's hard when you start adding elements that was really good wow that's crispy right there a nice little tight", "start": 588.48, "duration": 17.558}
{"chunk": "draw about 150 yards that's nuts I didn't even try to do that I'm so used to trying to manipulate this like I say first things is really like we'll go", "start": 599.399, "duration": 15.801}
{"chunk": "through and measure what you got in the bag talk about it a little bit favorites and that gives us like a jump off point today to be like okay what's problems", "start": 607.36, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "what's good what should we focus our attention on what are our goals for the session just make sure that you get out of much of it as uh as you need all right sounds like plan all right so it", "start": 616.04, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "takes about 15 minutes and we kind of talk as we're going but really you kind of just watch it and it's kind of fun to see what your golf clubs are built like right now so do you have any clubs in", "start": 625.12, "duration": 15.4}
{"chunk": "the bag that you favorite or ones that you hate I'm loving the eat iron like I just feel like I can get solid contact out of that eight okay again so the", "start": 632.92, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "eight iron the that was your favorite CLA yeah I you found that it's what the eight iron and the seven iron are the same length as each other so the eight", "start": 641.2, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "iron is a little over yeah and the Seven is matching the rest of the rest of the set what about swing weight but this is the the big one right here because", "start": 650.24, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "that's eight on longer than it should be it swing weight jumps up way higher than the rest so all of a sudden now we got two things standing out about the 8 yep could be psychological but now probably", "start": 658.44, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "not it's longer it's heavier in the head the L angle is almost certainly going to be different so there's loads of stuff different about the 8 so now it's almost like we're on a back back down to normal", "start": 667.76, "duration": 20.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "35 and 3/4 cut length on that that white line they're inch different yeah stepping all jacked up that makes it really tough you to pull an eight on out", "start": 677.639, "duration": 18.722}
{"chunk": "and then a N9 out and just is is that common or was that common back in' 08 or they just like hey this manufactur cut them up get them shipped out hey we yeah", "start": 687.76, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "go and that's that's the difference and we like to say that's the difference between Club assembly and club building you know when things are on assembly line just pump pump pump get it done", "start": 697.16, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "chop them up Muna are actually one of the best companies out there now for producing stock equipment they make really really good stuff and all other companies INF fairness have gone from", "start": 705.44, "duration": 19.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "this is 14 16 years old now right yeah they probably clean up so everyone's kind of fig out this is how we do it but mistakes get made you know building a", "start": 714.8, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "club with your spec we know one build is dedicated to all of your clubs so before we've done the The Loft and lies basically this is this is length and", "start": 722.92, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "flex and swing weight and we're looking for like I say either an increasing number going down the set which would be considered flighted getting softer and", "start": 731.6, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "four iron stiffer in the wedges or all this number within point two of each other would be considered under our scale really good a quarter of a flex difference but what we're seeing is half", "start": 739.279, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "a flex fluctuation pretty much through the through the set it's it's pretty good in the 99 8 iron 79 and 4 but the", "start": 748.8, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "five ir's softer the wedge is softer and you can start see these two you can ignore a little bit cuz they're a completely different product made by different people but the swing weight as", "start": 757.72, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "well we saw that big jump from the seven to the eight Lon that's the length issue that's gone on we've got you know conflicting lengths through the set some", "start": 768.48, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "longer some shorter um really it makes it hard to be a consistent golfer when your golf clubs are inconsistent so that's why this piece of the puzzle is so big for us to start it helps people", "start": 775.76, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "understand not only what we're going to do for them in terms of building the clubs but what they're playing with and starts to link those feelings well my 's good that gives me something to hang on", "start": 785.8, "duration": 17.997999999999998}
{"chunk": "to maybe this guy like swing weight maybe we need to add more length and I'll check out the line angle maybe it's i' like to get along with all my clubes if I could right all of them that's", "start": 794.399, "duration": 16.402}
{"chunk": "that's the thing have you had these adjusted or no um I had like one pro kind of dink around with my Gap where a little bit okay just to get the Loft in", "start": 802.32, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "the right spot or uh I think we were working with L angle okay it was a couple of years ago so same kind of thing here like the the Munos originally", "start": 811.519, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "had you know a standard right that was whatever that Loft was through the set I can't recall it right now um and then L angle for every half an inch you lose in", "start": 820.519, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "length you normally jump up about half a degree in L angle so that triangle is changing shape right and your your posture is going from forine down to", "start": 828.88, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "wedge so that lle adjusts with your your posture there's loads of different beliefs on be that much adjustment right like your setup should be pretty much your setup for a lot of the clubs like", "start": 837.16, "duration": 19.76}
{"chunk": "you don't really get much more bent over unless you're hitting well you're you're losing a few inches of golf shaft through like imagine your drivers out", "start": 847.16, "duration": 17.238}
{"chunk": "here and you're let's say most drivers around 59 60 58 something like that and then your wedge ends up at about 64 in a", "start": 855.639, "duration": 16.202}
{"chunk": "standard setup because obviously you've gone from 45 and a half Ines down to 35 in your case 4 and a half so we've lost like 10 in of golf shaft sure between", "start": 864.04, "duration": 18.998}
{"chunk": "those two clubs so that L angle has to dynamically you know be you are more on top of it just with that length change so we expect to see that lie fluctuate through the set but it just it should be", "start": 873.759, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "pretty linear although some people believe it should be all the same or there's a bunch of different theories on that but we we've had consistency wow", "start": 882.639, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "this is the pitching wedge this is a good one pitching W always goes uppr is it uppr it's up so it's 4\u00b0 up", "start": 891.519, "duration": 21.161}
{"chunk": "why that little left yesterday in that lesson tends to pull it when he hits it good yeah every ball to the left can I blame that on", "start": 900.519, "duration": 17.561999999999998}
{"chunk": "the we just let's just through that we tinkered with so in the example for the video that we did for the website we", "start": 913.24, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "moved my lob wedge was it 4 degrees Yeah and I literally would sit here and hit it into the left corner of the screen I watched that yeah it makes a difference", "start": 920.24, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "that was 4\u00b0 so this is your 9 on wiges at 62 and this is the pitching widget at 64", "start": 929.639, "duration": 15.518999999999998}
{"chunk": "how much higher the oh my God yeah just that club sing out flat on the ground there so you've got to count for that in your swing you're going to usually heel", "start": 937.319, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "dig heel grab you're also the other major factor is the Loft points left so the pitching wedge is more upright than", "start": 946.12, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "the mhm than the Gap gap wedge so yesterday we started with p did you hit kind of between that went", "start": 953.839, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "from Pitch to an eight eight iron was good yeah yeah well the yeah those first like 10es pretty good flat standard yeah", "start": 962.68, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "just slightly flatter than standard huh yep look at that your pitching W is two degrees more upright than your blob wge we'd like to probably get those about", "start": 970.399, "duration": 17.561999999999998}
{"chunk": "the same yeah my green in regulation is already going up this Seas basically all these will be really close H so just", "start": 979.56, "duration": 17.319}
{"chunk": "this low angle the fluctu sitation in L we want either a steady increase some people believe in Flatline but essentially this looks pretty good up half a degree and we lose half an inch", "start": 987.48, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "up half a degree up half a degree and then bang all of a sudden four degree jump that's pitching wedge and gap wedge both kind of yeah they're really upright", "start": 997.0, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "comparative to that to that nine iron that 8 iron that seven onon that 6 iron setup and then we go down into here and these two clubs are not part of that", "start": 1005.56, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "Muno sou and they're pretty much standard of what you'd see off the off the shelf okay so just in good posture arms hanging down Palms facing kind of", "start": 1013.759, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "me and that's a good referen as you glove there 362 in for the floor and 6'2 so so that's average right it like", "start": 1021.839, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "sounds like these numbers are starting to line up if you were looking at just static you're actually a little over so yeah tiny tiny bit", "start": 1030.4, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "so yeah is that a typical like kind of height of your flight too that was actually a little bit lower than I normally", "start": 1039.24, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "so this is seven iron in his set yeah angle of attacks just kind of matching what we've seen earlier zero is a", "start": 1049.6, "duration": 20.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "little little up on everything he like yesterday when we we had him out his ball position was real forward and everything was too forward yeah he had", "start": 1059.96, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "it Way Forward like driver okay it's pretty forward right there just looking at it that's nice little toey but seven", "start": 1069.559, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "angle attacks down one degree Club P into out half so do you remember sort of your key feels from yesterday what what were those I feel like that it was just", "start": 1079.0, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "turn this thing back keeping it close to the inside yeah and trying to be", "start": 1087.559, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "flatter and I from the comments I'm still doing this back there but I'm trying to think flat yep we're round", "start": 1094.0, "duration": 15.440000000000001}

{"chunk": "just check that ball position cuz it tends to get a little too up that was pretty", "start": 1111.52, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "good little push but the low point was better that's you can't hit better than that can I see the bottom of that club", "start": 1117.48, "duration": 16.918}
{"chunk": "for a second that's pretty good right there the last couple have been nice I definitely want to give him at least you know that that length back quarter inch", "start": 1127.799, "duration": 15.481000000000002}
{"chunk": "over at least yeah I think he needs more I think a half inch The Loft is pretty traditional you know this was strong for backing M 208 and now it's like one of", "start": 1139.48, "duration": 16.28}
