{"chunk": "all right back out at superstition mountain milo lines henry fall we're going to be talking about grip pressure in the golf swing", "start": 0.32, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "and specifically touching on in transition some things we notice with grip pressure that's going on that could be causing some issues", "start": 8.24, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "especially down at impact where it really matters so stay tuned we'll talk about it [Music]", "start": 16.72, "duration": 17.09}
{"chunk": "so we've all heard that you want to have your grip light and i would agree to some level", "start": 27.359, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "that we want our grip fairly light i don't want to grip it so tight that it's causing me to tighten up in my shoulders", "start": 35.44, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "and in my elbows too much but i also don't want to grip it so loosely that the club gets out of control on me now what i've seen", "start": 42.559, "duration": 19.761}
{"chunk": "from just teaching thousands of golf lessons is a lot of people that struggle with the golf swing they actually lose control up here at the top when they swing this club", "start": 53.12, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "up they lose control of the club this actually opens up this opens up so that they lose connection in both of those places and then from there", "start": 63.84, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "yeah nothing good ever happens now part of that has to do with not necessarily the firmness of the grip but their actual grip structure some of it has to do with how", "start": 72.88, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "they hold the golf club yeah some of it has to do with the fact that they are actually letting these bat these last three fingers", "start": 81.439, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "loose on the golf club which makes the head drop which we really don't want to let that club get free we want to make sure that when we're", "start": 90.0, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "holding on to that golf club we're holding it firmly enough so that i swing it to the top and i've got a fairly firm grip on it the club doesn't run away on", "start": 98.0, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "me right okay also connection points are really important so i see people if you lose that", "start": 107.04, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "connection you're probably not very good there's a pretty good correlation there so where the right hand is", "start": 116.159, "duration": 19.681}
{"chunk": "when i hinge my wrists that should stay connected and the club shouldn't get away from my left fingers like that yeah so how henry how tight do you feel", "start": 125.6, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "like you're gripping the golf club i mean it varies a little bit on the shot there's actually some shots i increase my pressure like if you're", "start": 135.12, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "hitting out a deep rough right you're gonna you're holding onto the club more securely so that the club can't twist in your hands right right so um but i would say", "start": 142.959, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "normally like if it was on a scale of one to ten i'm i'm honestly probably above that five number most of the time a lot of people think you should be", "start": 152.239, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "gripping it at like a one or two but to me i mean i do have a fair amount of swing speed so that's part of it", "start": 160.239, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "so i need control over that club face and having some pressure in the fingers and in my grip is where i want it i really don't want a lot of tension up in my", "start": 168.08, "duration": 17.038}
{"chunk": "arms and forearms but definitely down in the grip i i have a little more pressure and i'd say because i hold the golf club", "start": 176.879, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "really in my fingers if you measured the pressure it's probably fairly strong you know i have it's probably greater than a lot of people think", "start": 184.319, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "and compared to i mean with your swing speed especially so one especially since you know i've been doing this for a long time", "start": 193.44, "duration": 16.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "my hands are pretty strong as far as just grip strength goes so for me to be what feels like not a lot of pressure because i definitely feel like i'm less than five", "start": 201.12, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "you know i feel like i'm holding on the golf club probably at like a three yeah but my three in motion yeah is probably enough to hurt", "start": 210.72, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "somebody's hand right yeah how hard i'm squeezing so there's a lot of pressure in it i guess my five pluses in relation to what my", "start": 219.44, "duration": 15.278999999999998}
{"chunk": "general understanding of this is but yeah i mean i i definitely i acknowledge the fact that there there", "start": 226.879, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "is more pressure here than maybe some people think at starting point yeah so i start with you know enough pressure so that when i", "start": 235.04, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "move off the golf ball i can control the golf club if i was gripping it super loose when i move off the golf the club would look like that well i think", "start": 243.519, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "you know a lot of people they they kind of got struck in the 90s by ernie yells and fred couples vj singh", "start": 251.92, "duration": 16.078}
{"chunk": "and they kind of had these you know long fluid golf swings and they think that they're not swinging hard or gripping it tightly when in reality if i guarantee you if you", "start": 259.759, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "bring them into a lab and did some testing they're swinging pretty aggressively and i mean i've heard fred couples say i swing as hard as i can", "start": 269.199, "duration": 16.402}
{"chunk": "yeah so i've hit balls next to fred couples and asked him and he's hitting as hard as he can i've also you think of those swings as being slow", "start": 276.8, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "and smooth yeah i challenge most of you to film your swing set it side by side to one of those guys and watch and see who hits the ball first", "start": 287.36, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "they just have their flow and their sequencing is i mean world class obviously yeah so um all right so let's talk about the top", "start": 294.8, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "though because that was kind of the topic of this this was from a youtube question and it was as we start transitioning down", "start": 303.12, "duration": 20.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "we know a lot of people struggle with this sort of pulling down they're trying to sort of one either create lag this way", "start": 313.039, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "or they they slide and they pull a combination of things right you get steep so how do we combination the pivot that we like", "start": 321.199, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "right that sequencing where we get in the ground are we still pretty firm up here so my pressure actually i would guess it", "start": 331.12, "duration": 15.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "it probably slightly increases as the club goes faster yeah so yeah up at the top of the swing there's definitely enough pressure in my hands", "start": 338.56, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "to keep the club from getting floppy on me right and there's enough structure in my arms to keep things from breaking down so", "start": 348.0, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "the real key to the whole thing is kind of the timing of the change of direction yeah so what i see people do you know you swing up here you come to a", "start": 354.8, "duration": 15.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "stop and then you go to hit it i'm out of order yeah or they swing it up here and they go to hit it with their hands maybe they want to hit down on it or", "start": 364.4, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "something it's hard to know exactly what's in their head but generally there's something going on their their intention what they're", "start": 373.12, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "trying to do is off yeah so what i'm trying to do with the golf club is i'm trying to it's basically like i'm throwing it back this way", "start": 381.6, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "and then my body's catching it so the club goes here and my body catches it and turns it the other way and naturally when that happens you can see that that", "start": 390.4, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "kind of sets the club and makes it fall back this way a little bit looks like his pressure's gone from like you know maybe a 10 to down to like a", "start": 399.12, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "five because of this the supination of that trail arm and now the right hand is basically getting more underneath or on the side of this club", "start": 408.0, "duration": 20.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "the other thing that people get mistaken they think that supination is opening the face but supination of this arm if you actually", "start": 417.36, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "look at that face the face is not opening yeah so i don't want it to do this all right this would be an ugly mess", "start": 426.16, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "because now i've got to recover from something terrible so is this super pretty physically challenging to do though i would imagine right like", "start": 435.199, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "this well yeah i guess supination and external rotation in that shoulder too much but i see a lot of people when they feel like they're letting the club shallow", "start": 442.8, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "out they do this yeah okay and now that now we've got the face pointed straight at the sky what i really want to see", "start": 451.28, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "when that changes directions you can see it's still in a strong position it's still square ish you know once it gets down in here you can see that that club is that face", "start": 458.88, "duration": 16.558}
{"chunk": "is ready to go i don't want to see it opening up in transition but there's really no necessarily softening or lightening of the grip", "start": 467.599, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "but it is i guess at a pressure level that still allows that for it to happen because if you if you if you go up softly where it's", "start": 475.919, "duration": 18.002}
{"chunk": "almost too soft then then you grab it you have to increase that pressure and if you increase the pressure because that club's moving 100 miles an hour yeah if you increase the pressure", "start": 485.44, "duration": 17.438000000000002}
{"chunk": "out of the top you'll get that look right i want to feel like or if your hands come off or something if your hand comes off then you're", "start": 494.479, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "already guaranteed that it's not going to go where you want it to this yeah the odds are pretty slim that you can recover from that yeah a lot of timing", "start": 502.319, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "so show us show us a slow one where you sequence and that club you know it's going to shallow a little bit", "start": 509.759, "duration": 15.202}
{"chunk": "now you guys at home might look like his pressure's you know almost decreasing at the top but it's really not", "start": 517.12, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "pressure's still there it's just what's happening with this pivot and getting into the ground that sequencing is what causes that to look", "start": 525.279, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "more languid i guess just like if you were tipping a baseball bat i bet baseball players don't have a light grip at the top", "start": 534.48, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "not when they change directions i guarantee that there's yeah they've got a bat's heavy they've got to be holding on to it tight enough so that", "start": 551.2, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "i mean there's no way they're hitting home runs over the green monster with a light grip pressure so", "start": 559.44, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "i think there's probably some similarities you see it with that pressure as well i don't really feel like i do anything different with my golf swing than i did", "start": 567.2, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "when i was a kid and a kid playing baseball i felt like the two motions are really similar just some different alignments with how", "start": 575.76, "duration": 16.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "my hands work yeah but the way that the motions work and the way that the pressure works and the way that the change of direction works yeah pretty similar so one thing we've", "start": 583.6, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "talked about before too is sort of laddering or building things up right so whether it's building up the speed or in", "start": 592.48, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "any case if you want to feel this sort of shallow move and sequencing right", "start": 600.0, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "at the top you can have a light grip pressure just to feel that feel the club weight behind you but you better hit it off a t and only", "start": 608.24, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "hit it like 20 yards yeah so you're feeling really soft but going really slow really slowly what club's at it's a seven iron he's hitting it maybe", "start": 616.48, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "carrying a hundred yeah maybe it went even shorter for us so i'll go so let's let's do your grip pressure at a one right now a one", "start": 625.44, "duration": 18.638}
{"chunk": "right so you can hit something like that and you probably could see that sort of this motion right here but", "start": 637.12, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "i i if you're doing this in a full swing at full speed you can't you can't do it with a grip pressure one it's just not gonna work", "start": 646.48, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "one won't work so my grip pressure is gonna be and it basically starts off right off the ball my grip pressure is going to be enough to control the club yeah", "start": 654.16, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "so if i'm going to hit this ball like my normal 7 iron 195 you know that's going to be definitely from the beginning there was more", "start": 662.72, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "pressure in the in the grip right because otherwise i would have lost control because i moved that club off the ball pretty fast", "start": 675.839, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "right all right so just to sum up this this video on grip pressure again a lot of you are probably pulling", "start": 683.44, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "down from the top because of how light you were at the beginning and then your grip structure might have not been the best so then you get kind", "start": 693.519, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "of loose here you pull down you're trying to create lag or hit down on the ball whatever it may be so don't be afraid to mess around with", "start": 702.48, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "grip pressure and you can have it higher than you think a little tighter than you think so the real key is your grip the pressure's", "start": 710.959, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "fairly tight in the fingers but you've got to have the loose wrists and arms so you can grip it as tight as you want as long as you have freedom", "start": 719.44, "duration": 16.961}
