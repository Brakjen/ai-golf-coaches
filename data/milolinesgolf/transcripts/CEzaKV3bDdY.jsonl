{"chunk": "decided i want to make a change i want to make my golf swing better what do we generally see from most people what what's their process", "start": 38.0, "duration": 18.159}

{"chunk": "they never really had someone or honestly assess themselves physically if they're able to do it so i would say that there's four levels of change one", "start": 55.76, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "is can you physically make the change sometimes people have bad hips and shoulders and wrists and and leg issues and whatnot", "start": 64.159, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "mobility issues and they simply can't make that change they're looking for but let's say that they can well can they then repeat that change on", "start": 71.68, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "the range generally in a slow fashion to begin with and then over time with as you build confidence in what you're doing", "start": 79.52, "duration": 16.559}

{"chunk": "hit some shots on the range and they immediately take it out to game day with their and they play their five dollar nassau or whatever they get one bad shot", "start": 111.6, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "and they say the hell with this exactly didn't work scratch it that guy doesn't know what he's talking about and i'm gonna do what i've always done and they're right back where they were to begin with yeah exactly because they", "start": 119.28, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "didn't stick to the process so change does it happen like that no sir it does not and the reality is is that yes you are changing", "start": 128.72, "duration": 18.398}
{"chunk": "a motor pattern but what you're really changing is your brain because the muscles don't have memory your brain does", "start": 138.319, "duration": 15.362000000000002}
{"chunk": "so to change that it takes time and it takes uh effort and it takes a while for your brain to build confidence in this new pattern that", "start": 146.08, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "you're trying to build to then execute it when now you have a cost to it i mean out here on the range you can blow it 100 yards left or right", "start": 155.2, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "it's irrelevant but on the golf course you've got your four dollar premium golf ball there's bunkers and water and somebody's backyard where they're", "start": 162.72, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "barbecuing and embarrassment in front of your friends add all that together with something you're not confident with a lot of times the recipe for disaster", "start": 171.36, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "yeah and it's usually it you end up going right back to where you're comfortable 100 because you know a lot of times the change we're making", "start": 179.92, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "it requires your ability to commit you have to be able to sometimes it might even be your lining up different you're seeing the target in a totally different way 100 percent everything looks", "start": 188.08, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "different and then you're out there on the golf course and it's like oh i'm not used to aiming this way everything looks weird yes and you hit a foul ball", "start": 197.04, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "yes it happens yes it's like trying to take a major league player hey you're throwing the curveball wrong and you retrain them and the first", "start": 205.68, "duration": 16.799}

{"chunk": "what he's comfortable with yeah exactly so let's let's walk through right now i'm going to play a student who's who's making a change let's say i'm a student who", "start": 222.319, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "maybe i'm a little armsy and i'm backing out of the golf shot my levers are unloading you know is it the chicken or the egg", "start": 231.36, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "that's causing me to unload my levers is it me backing up or is it just am i backing up because i'm unloading my levers i don't know but we've gotta", "start": 239.2, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "we gotta make a change we have to make a change we know that so what we do know is that and we don't know what causes which right is it again is it the", "start": 248.4, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "chicken or the egg we're not 100 sure but we do know that we have to get you in a position where that video in your brain has to get", "start": 256.32, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "reprogrammed to what's comfortable to you and right now if you have a guy who let's say that they don't early extend", "start": 264.56, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "per se but they back away to extend their arm so they're going they stay down but they do that well a lot of times for those players you would say", "start": 272.24, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "okay well then keep your right arm a little more bent keep your right wrist a little more extended well okay they may do that but chances are if that", "start": 280.72, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "that's not what they're comfortable with they're comfortable seeing their head back away if they're comfortable with this moving this way they're going to keep doing this to make contact so often", "start": 290.32, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "i'll have them when they're standing at a dress can you stand over just the ball yep i'll have them put pressure on my hand and leave pressure there now just give me a waist", "start": 298.4, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "tight away tie and i don't care about the results it's irrelevant how it goes it don't care how you hit it that's not the point if the", "start": 307.36, "duration": 15.56}
{"chunk": "point of this is to reprogram your brain to feel comfortable staying in the shot all the way around the corner and it takes time it doesn't happen", "start": 320.8, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "overnight and it doesn't have in one shot it won't even take one bucket it may take more time it may take drills that you have to do at home whether it's", "start": 329.039, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "doing the airplane drill at home or you're putting your head on the wall or whatever it is you got to do but it takes time and you will feel uncomfortable and chances are if you're", "start": 336.479, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "uncomfortable you're a lot closer to where you want to be than where you were and i guarantee you you will not be able to add speed", "start": 345.68, "duration": 19.198}
{"chunk": "right away because when you go fast it triggers the natural motion that's built in it's like a computer program it's written yes", "start": 354.639, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "and it wants to show up yes and so the minute you add speed you show back up i don't care who you are yes you're back yep so you've got to", "start": 363.52, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "override it once you have to go slow for quite a while and so you're going to really feel exaggerated everything you do is going to be the opposite so if i'm", "start": 372.16, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "used to going this way now i'm going to feel like i'm staying my head's staying out and i'm going to even feel like my head is working down", "start": 380.8, "duration": 15.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "and staying out yes and i'm because of that i'm going to feel like my arms are staying this arm's gonna feel like it's maintaining its", "start": 388.16, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "bend and this wrist is gonna maintain its bend a lot longer and i'm gonna stay like that now i know my head didn't go this way no way it", "start": 396.8, "duration": 19.598}
{"chunk": "didn't you wouldn't let it no way and so for someone who's making that change that is going to be so uncomfortable 100 they're going to feel like they're", "start": 405.199, "duration": 17.122}
{"chunk": "crowding the ball that that they're going to fall on their face uh and whatnot but and and we'll get into other videos as to why and how your", "start": 414.72, "duration": 18.160000000000004}
{"chunk": "pressure changes and how it allow you to do this more comfortably but in this particular case about making the change particularly is you have to go", "start": 424.0, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "through this process of reprogramming what you feel comfortable doing okay so let's walk through this again", "start": 432.88, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "phase number one is to assess your ability to even do it you have to even make the change physically if you physically can't do it", "start": 440.56, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "in slow motion you can't do it no you can't so that's number one we've got to assess our ability to do it now if we still", "start": 448.16, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "want to do it then maybe we need to go do some mobility exercises off the golf course yes and find a way to get our body better yeah", "start": 456.16, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "but if we can do it slow so if i know i can okay i can i can make this happen slow well now i know i'm capable of it at least", "start": 465.199, "duration": 15.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "so now i'm going to start doing it slow and applying it to the ball right gradually figure out how to add some speed to it", "start": 473.28, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "make it hold together on the driving range and then i'm going to take it out my preference would be go out by yourself yes when you're making a change", "start": 481.68, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "so you don't have any pressure on you it's not going to embarrass you if you hit it squirrely who cares get some confidence in your ability to transfer it out there before you", "start": 490.4, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "put pressure on it because if we put pressure on it too soon it's going to blow up on you and you're gonna probably walk away and not ever not not", "start": 500.0, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "continue with the change even though it might be beneficial that's right and also when you're on the range and you're making this change", "start": 508.56, "duration": 15.517999999999999}
{"chunk": "i know it stinks but try to video yourself about every fifth swing and the only reason is is it's confirmation bias", "start": 516.159, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "right you may think you're doing it and you may start what you think is reprogramming that brain to what you see but if you're not seeing it you're not", "start": 525.2, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "videoing it and you're not confirming i'm doing what i think i'm doing then you're just making bad habits because not everybody can have change you or me standing right there telling", "start": 534.48, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "them yep you did it right or no you didn't exactly so you've gotta know what you're looking for have a really good plan and then", "start": 543.279, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "have some feedback because with no feedback it's not going to work so you might even build a station that's ed with his hand on you yes and so you figure out how to you know you create", "start": 550.64, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "something maybe a swim noodle a stick stick it in your bag and have the swim noodle come out and barely touch the rim of your broom of your hat and then make sure that you always keep contact with", "start": 559.92, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "that thing all the way around the corner yep so maybe so build a station and then gradually get away from the station because you", "start": 568.72, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "don't want to have that as a crutch but you have to have some feedback there first but i totally agree yep awesome exactly so that's the process", "start": 576.24, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "i hope this helps now this again is ed lassiter so if anybody wants to get in touch with ed for lessons where do you teach ed i'm down in chula vista", "start": 585.6, "duration": 17.76}
