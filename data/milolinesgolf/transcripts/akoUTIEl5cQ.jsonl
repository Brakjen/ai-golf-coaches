{"chunk": "the two most important angles in the golf swing when we talk about angles what kind of things could we possibly be talking about probably for a lot of people at home they're think okay well", "start": 13.759, "duration": 17.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "they're talking about lag they're talking about shaftline right so those are a couple things you might think of angle of attack", "start": 22.359, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "yeah things with the golf club yeah right but we're actually talking about two angles in the body that will help you achieve some of those things you're", "start": 30.519, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "looking for for sure okay so angle number one is wrist angles and I would say you cannot have proper wrist angles", "start": 38.719, "duration": 19.842}
{"chunk": "without angle number two so if if I swing this golf club back and I create Dynamic wrist structure and I just turn", "start": 48.92, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "to the ball I'm going to miss unless I add in a little bit more of what I want from angle number two which angle number", "start": 57.92, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "two is Hip Flex basically hinge from the hips to get us down so we got this structured wrist now we create a little", "start": 65.88, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "bit of angle in our pelvis and we can make good contact so those two match up was what you're saying so without one we", "start": 74.84, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "can't really have you can't have one without the other right so just like if I were to", "start": 84.32, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "get flex and hinge from the hips here in the downswing create that angle but unload my wrist conditions", "start": 91.119, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "well guess what you're going to be hitting way behind the ball which is a huge answer to many of our students they say well if I when I add in this Flex in", "start": 101.2, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "my pelvis so I kind of sit in transition I hit it fat every time yeah how do I do it without chunking how do I do it without chunking well you have to learn", "start": 110.68, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "how to Pivot your body without pushing your wrist down yeah and it's kind of a combination of those two right cuz they they one when they kind", "start": 118.96, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "of try to sit down they don't also add in the turn but they especially pull or throw down the club and I would say", "start": 126.88, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "that's because the most common pattern you see amongst golfers is they swing back and they throw the club down like", "start": 135.48, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "this and so because they throw the club down they also tend to straighten their legs out and stand up that's how they make space for that and they tend to hit", "start": 142.4, "duration": 18.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "it on the toe got a whole bunch of different issues that happen so when we add in Hip Flex in transition a lot of times they don't turn they just Flex", "start": 152.64, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "their hips and then the club's never going to get up there so then they still throw but if they learn how to flex and", "start": 160.4, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "turn then they just they don't have to hold the angles they just don't have to throw them yeah they they're maintain if you sort of allow it yes at least to", "start": 167.879, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "later on in the in the hitting area okay so we got our right wrist angle our hip hinge but are we doing this hip hinge at", "start": 177.04, "duration": 15.878}
{"chunk": "setup there's some of it there's a little bit of it so at a dress there is our pelvis is fairly neutral it's just a", "start": 185.159, "duration": 15.082}
{"chunk": "little bit angled down at a dress then as we turn to the top our pelvis stays in a fairly the same constant state more or", "start": 192.4, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "less so as I'm turning you can see I turn on an incline plane but then as I transition we're at the hip hinge is being added in yep there's a little hip", "start": 201.64, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "hinge a little knee Flex so we're just flexing ourselves down so we can get everything aimed down to the ball and that could be a little bit of a side", "start": 210.76, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "angle is that knee flex and transition too towards the end but but it's really that hip hinge what we're looking for cuz that it keeps your chest down it", "start": 218.879, "duration": 19.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "gives you space yep you know that's a that's a really important area we from ipga schooling it was called The Sacred", "start": 228.12, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "area we wanted to make sure we kept some space in the sacred area right so so many people are pushing up into that", "start": 236.519, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "area and things have to get unloaded the two match up we got our wrist angle we got our hip hinge so even just doing some of that", "start": 243.319, "duration": 17.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "stuff at home like this you know it looks kind of goofy but I do that stuff all the time yes you do yes I do and", "start": 252.76, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "it's good for you anytime you can just be training a pattern so you could be doing something like this or you could sit here with the club and do something", "start": 261.199, "duration": 20.681}
{"chunk": "like this and then let the club swing you're training yourself to stay out of the way and pivot correctly just open the refrigerator close the refrigerator", "start": 270.56, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "right there you go so how are we going to practice this what what about just doing it with your right hand could you do it that way that's an awesome way to do it so you could just practice swing", "start": 280.479, "duration": 18.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "it back and then gently you're you're not going to try to go fast you're going to feel a little Flex turn deliver without throwing this down", "start": 289.28, "duration": 21.159}
{"chunk": "so something along those lines and just chip it out there and just chip it out there and you could actually try to hit it and leave that", "start": 299.759, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "angle there you know with one hand on I don't want to fight it right now so easier just to hit it but that's a really good drill M and if you start", "start": 310.759, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "feeling yourself applying right hand Force you'll hit it fat every time there we have it well we've done a video too on this about with Elite golf on The", "start": 321.0, "duration": 15.92}
