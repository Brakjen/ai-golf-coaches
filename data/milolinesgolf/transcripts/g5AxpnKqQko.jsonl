{"chunk": "hey guys we're going to talk about how to get uber spin on these little short shots around the green so you can stop it fast", "start": 10.96, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "all right we're back with cme today hello golf thanks for coming on you're shaking your hand man i'll link those below for sure um so sam", "start": 23.84, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "you're kind of like the short game wizard i i guess i guess so we got this little shot here and unfortunately the conditions allow us to", "start": 37.28, "duration": 18.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "create that little extra spin that we'd like to see some of the tour pros make these shots look silly don't worry absolutely i think of like abraham", "start": 46.239, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "answer oh man oh crazy i'll try to put up a couple of videos for you um but milo why don't we start with you", "start": 53.28, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "what do you kind of do to create that little extra spin if you need it around the green open prey no", "start": 68.32, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "there's some secrets to it so one thing i do is i i change my setup so the ball position is going to move forward okay i play the ball with more of an", "start": 76.88, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "open fake and the swing is going to be a little bit bigger and you're really trying to get that ball to grip the face and kind of ride", "start": 86.24, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "those grooves yeah and so when you know you nipped it good the ball comes off a little extra low even though the face was open you see that thing come out flat it's like oh", "start": 94.32, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "that one's ripped right yeah and one thing i would say too is like we've talked before about sorely", "start": 102.56, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "softer shots maybe in this case you actually want just a little more speed now it doesn't need to be like accelerate but a little more speed in", "start": 109.6, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "the totality of the action and there's a little streak kind of right at the bottom you're actually letting these angles exactly how i set up for like if i want", "start": 120.88, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "to spin it and i think like you said the bigger swing it allows you to kind of be somewhat aggressive because you have the open face if you have a face like this", "start": 135.36, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "you're not going to swing hard like it's going to go in the parking lot so yeah the open face is key the big bigger swing yeah i like that", "start": 143.92, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "that's exactly what i do all right let me take this one you're going to hit a couple because you were already spinning it like crazy where are you going to hit it from right here is", "start": 152.72, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "good right here can the camera see this yep so again the the lie is we got some good grass here he's got a little upslope", "start": 160.72, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "and a soft green so you can get some good cheddar on these but it still feels fun still spawn i missed it", "start": 169.76, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "that was niffy beautiful sound the ball's a little forward in your stance yeah especially on this uphill lie so you can keep gliding", "start": 181.04, "duration": 15.958999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah if i put it back in my stance i'm going to kind of bang into the bank and dig yeah so it's a little forward the backswing's fairly large", "start": 190.72, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "and then i'm just kind of letting that ball that club fall right into that ball that one has some sideways so there's a little cut spin to it too", "start": 199.44, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "right would you say yeah because in order to get max friction on that the ball is actually kind of rolling on the face like this", "start": 207.84, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "and so it's putting a little cut english on it okay let's do yourself all right let's see it mr cheddar", "start": 215.599, "duration": 17.281999999999996}
{"chunk": "mr cheddar yup milo like you said wall more forward because of the bank now i slightly put my weight a little bit", "start": 223.92, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "left yeah i mean these beans are so soft you're not going to get that first balance and stuff right you almost need to carry it yeah flat to the target let", "start": 231.68, "duration": 18.322}
{"chunk": "it stop all right i need to get one super clean those haven't been that clean so that little bit of that diagonal", "start": 244.72, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "action you're talking about like the ball the ball basically going from center and riding up towards the toe a little", "start": 264.479, "duration": 15.918999999999999}
{"chunk": "bit yeah so a little bit of that is is i actually like to feel like the handle is kind of going", "start": 272.639, "duration": 15.282}
{"chunk": "up and left around me like that and the face stays right more open you called it the selfie point back yeah", "start": 280.0, "duration": 15.597999999999999}
{"chunk": "so we've done a video on um that chevy move all right so it's a little bit like that", "start": 289.68, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "these are spinning a lot because it's a short shot i mean it's only 10 yards yeah oh that was a ripper", "start": 312.24, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "we there's a little bit of that like you guys were saying almost a little bit of the unloading letting go but there's that speed at the", "start": 322.88, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "bottom too your discretion advised that was nasty it was fun that's the risk when you start because", "start": 332.0, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "when this really unloads a lot you're actually the amount of loft that's being exposed it's changing pretty fast through the ball yeah so it's a fun shot maybe not", "start": 343.28, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "something we should do all the time not all the time if you need it absolutely those tour pros are pretty good at it though when they need to", "start": 353.12, "duration": 20.958}
{"chunk": "but they also get great wise but they have to be able to put a little bit of extra spin on it because the things that they're landing it on are usually fairly firm so to control that", "start": 361.919, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "ball they need spin but off of a perfect line it's pretty easy to create hey guys thanks for watching sam thanks for coming appreciate it thank you guys and", "start": 374.4, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "uh again we'll link those sleeves below so you guys can get some of these uh swag yeah right absolutely and uh let us", "start": 383.28, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "know how it goes with you guys trying out to get some uber spins around the green", "start": 391.68, "duration": 13.198}
