{"chunk": "we see this happening and now what's happened to my my turn and there's no bins at all so now i'm i'm actually bent to the right yes and so from here the", "start": 107.92, "duration": 16.478}
{"chunk": "only place that he can do is topple that thing the other way and be steep so it's going to go like this 100 okay so now we've covered the main problem we see", "start": 116.159, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "what are we trying to do well i think what we're trying to do here is to have this go back in one piece probably to about um right about here", "start": 124.719, "duration": 18.642}
{"chunk": "and so we're actually going in the left bend and we're trying to keep our arms reasonably straight so when you say left bend what does that mean well left bend", "start": 134.08, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "comes from the upper top part it does not come from the bottom it comes from the top so we're bending from our rib cage up kind of", "start": 143.2, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "so this would be a left bend yes a left bend so as i turn i'm actually bending this way yes versus", "start": 150.239, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "this way where now the club is so that would be going in the right bin and sucking the club inside 100 which is i see that like all the time yep a lot okay a lot for sure so that's not what", "start": 160.08, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "we want to do we want to go into left bend as we're turning now what does that do if i'm going in the left bend what does that do to the golf club and the structure of my arms here that will", "start": 169.12, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "usually keep the club head and the first off the arms will be longer yeah you won't over bend them two you won't start early extending these levers yet and", "start": 177.519, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "the club head will stay on this side of your body as it starts to move its way up okay in a steeper fashion because it will match your shoulders so that was", "start": 187.36, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "another one of the questions somebody said one of the youtube subscribers had is how do i stand the club up and so the the key we're coming up with", "start": 195.76, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "here to standing this golf club up is is getting these bends to work right yes so that our right arm kind of stays a little more on top as we go back and now", "start": 204.4, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "as my wrists hinge you can see naturally that club is a little bit more stood up yes okay okay so it's more of a result of how our body's bending and turning", "start": 212.72, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "versus trying to stand it up so you're not actually trying to like hinge it this way no to stand it up no", "start": 222.4, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "okay as a result of your bends i just wanted to make sure we clarified that for everybody that we're we're bending and turning", "start": 230.0, "duration": 18.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "which creates that and it also creates when you're bending correctly it creates a huge turn so you start loading your system in a", "start": 238.239, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "manner in which by the time even before you get to the top you're ready to unload the opposite direction yes i like to liken it to baseball players", "start": 248.0, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "so when you watch a hitter get ready to to hit this hip doesn't go down it actually stays up and you can see how", "start": 257.759, "duration": 17.042}
{"chunk": "my ribcage is loaded and bent this way yes now i'm ready to spring the other way 100 so i can expand the left side of my body in transition", "start": 266.16, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "and it's like it creates a lot of speed and force where if i was like this trying to hit well i have this is", "start": 275.12, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "already expanded so now all i can do is swat it with my arm one hunt yep it's true okay yeah so i would say that's probably one of the", "start": 282.72, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "main things we see so a golf swing is kind of like setting up dominoes if you set the dominoes up the right way all you have to do is knock them over", "start": 291.36, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "and they all fall down hopefully most of the time if we set up our golf swing correctly now when i start to unwind what's going", "start": 300.4, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "to naturally happen well hopefully we're going to start from the ground up so as you start in transition you'll see that as we've always talked about this left knee", "start": 309.36, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "starts to go around and the left hip is down and then you're going to supinate this and now the club is going to get behind you yes and that creates a position where", "start": 317.759, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "you can pivot as hard as you want and the club is going to just trail you trail me all the way around so", "start": 326.479, "duration": 15.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "it looks something like i'll go slow so people can see it something like that where that club shallows out and comes around", "start": 334.72, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "[Applause] so it's not going this way to the ball yep exactly perfect so a lot of people say well uh do it do", "start": 344.55, "duration": 17.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "i drive my right elbow in no if you supinate this that takes care of what this elbow does you don't have to dig this elbow in", "start": 356.08, "duration": 18.798}
{"chunk": "like what you think is supposed to happen and because most times when people try this their body fights it and then it goes this way anyway so if you get up here to the top and you", "start": 365.759, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "have reasonable structure if this hand is turning the doorknob like we talked about this elbow would work its way inside a seam line and", "start": 374.479, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "you'll be right here anyway yep to turn i actually had a lesson today with a really really good young player who's been trying to get this arm in", "start": 383.36, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "front of him for a while now and hadn't been very successful with it and i had him just feel like he got up here and he let", "start": 392.0, "duration": 18.48}

{"chunk": "it's that easy and i just smiled and said that's all you have to feel and you get what you want so", "start": 409.52, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "let's review this real fast so as we're taking the club back our goal is we are shifting a little pressure", "start": 419.599, "duration": 15.042000000000002}
{"chunk": "turning and bending and bending yes and we're bending to the left for right-handed golfers yes okay", "start": 429.12, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "i where we go wrong and where most of you go wrong is you start bending to the right right away 100 okay so", "start": 437.44, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "because yes you are right the club head does have to get behind you but it gets behind you on your downswing not on your backswing per se", "start": 445.68, "duration": 18.321}
