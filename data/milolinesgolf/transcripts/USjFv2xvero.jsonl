{"chunk": "conditions operate so I look back on my planing career and I've had many amazing coaches along the way along with you now", "start": 24.76, "duration": 17.08}

{"chunk": "kind of rely and go back to especially Under Pressure right for sure I think all of us have kind of a swing thumb print mhm and it never changes the", "start": 43.28, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "things that helped you once will probably help you again yeah exactly when I was playing junior golf up in the state of Maine that's where I'm from I", "start": 52.76, "duration": 18.439}
{"chunk": "was taught by Kevin Joseph great instructor he had a friend named Mike niichel who used to actually play I Believe on the PJ tour and the champions", "start": 62.039, "duration": 15.321}

{"chunk": "actually came up to Maine and got to see me actually hit some shots on the driving range I think I was probably 18 to 20 in that time frame um obviously I", "start": 77.2, "duration": 19.24}
{"chunk": "was I was pretty good at the time I i' want a few state junior championships up in Maine and you know I could get my my ball around the golf course but I was", "start": 87.2, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "really more of a short gamer and kind of a a manager I wasn't the best ball Striker I would say I could hit somewhat far but to me I thought my ball striking", "start": 95.0, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "could improve and he watched me hit some drivers my problem was always a little bit of a block or a bit of a overdraw", "start": 104.64, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "okay with driver and my tendency was to get my pelvis really sliding laterally so my pelvis moving laterally there's a", "start": 111.88, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "lot of push off from down the line there was a fair amount of the hips pushing into the ball too so I had a really high", "start": 121.039, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "handle something you've probably seen in my swing a little bit from time to time right so I'm I'm always working on this", "start": 129.2, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "but it was kind of this move this kind of up and forward now the other issue that came about was my upper Center", "start": 136.84, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "sometimes would also wander with that so you get everything floating out in front now you're talking Block City you got a path that's a little too into out mhm", "start": 145.0, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "switching sides you got a club face that's a little open So Not only was it maybe a block sometimes it was like a block slice or a block cut and that was", "start": 154.48, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "a nightmare to hit off the tea so now I'm like making adjustments on the golf course my alignment and it just not it wasn't pretty it also led to some really", "start": 162.92, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "big divots which again you've seen from time to time I can get a nice Beaver pet sometimes yeah so again lateral was kind", "start": 172.84, "duration": 19.720999999999997}
{"chunk": "of the big theme now interesting the way he kind of looked at it he would he would stood on the face on side and watched me with driver and he noticed", "start": 182.4, "duration": 18.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "that while I had some lateral for sure no doubt about it he noticed my head was getting really out towards the Target", "start": 191.72, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "and moving with my middle so so your whole Mass was floating this direction oh yeah so my head was actually getting out in front of the Ballwood driver", "start": 199.799, "duration": 16.121}
{"chunk": "again everything is now blocked and out to the right so what he said is look he said look young man if you want to hit driver well you got to keep their head", "start": 207.799, "duration": 17.161}
{"chunk": "behind the ball so I said oh okay well that's easy enough I played a little baseball growing up you got kind of the object you're trying to hit up there you keep your head behind the ball so it's", "start": 216.4, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "like oh okay that's easy enough made a few swings kept my head behind the ball ball started more online so I could still get away with some of that lateral", "start": 225.64, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "movement but not get too out in front of it that was kind of the big thing so for me visually especially as a rightee dominant player it has helped me a lot", "start": 235.04, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "as a focus to go back to is feeling like my head's a little behind the ball even at setup with an iron or a wedge the ball is more on my left eye or ear and", "start": 243.239, "duration": 19.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "it feels a little forward so for you guys that watch at home you might notice that my ball is a little more forward in my stance than maybe some yours is", "start": 253.12, "duration": 16.599}
{"chunk": "pretty far forward as well I would say yeah I think most guys who hit a cut play a little more forward as my crew's G I've gone more to that that pattern", "start": 261.479, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "but the setup feeling the head behind the ball and then even in the actual down swing and into impact feeling like", "start": 269.44, "duration": 15.120000000000001}

{"chunk": "the left hand the angle he had coming down into impact in that left wrist I really noticed that and the reason I", "start": 327.8, "duration": 18.44}

{"chunk": "the way he could his move with the wedges and irons though is different than his driver move and it's really good yeah and the way he can manipulate the Flight of the ball with his hands", "start": 364.36, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "was just phenomenal so I watched that video over and over again I just saw that left wrist angle I thought you know what what if I was able to apply a", "start": 373.12, "duration": 18.24}

{"chunk": "little bit keep it in play a little bit more I knew I could hit it high but I wanted to be able to hit some of those more piercing shots so I started", "start": 390.28, "duration": 16.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "applying that into my game I started feeling like the grip was really in my fingers and I really felt that right", "start": 398.639, "duration": 15.079999999999998}

{"chunk": "well yep so in racket ball we're really more flat with our impact whereas tennis you got you're a little bit more you", "start": 431.039, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "know put Top Spin or cut spin but racket ball you're much more flat there's much more of that wrist angle coming to the ball knuckle balls into the wall versus", "start": 439.199, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "Spinners a lot of the time so that feel was very familiar to me and I again I've been doing it throughout my plane career but it was a nice reminder and something", "start": 447.8, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "that I've ingrained is sort of one of my three key feels so so far we've got feel number one head behind the ball feel", "start": 457.24, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "number two Trail wrist extension orist angle to me those two really go together too it's hard to have your head out here", "start": 464.319, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "and an extended wrist just doesn't really match up you wouldn't get the ball in the air at all right so you think about if you were cutting down a a tree right here my head would be back", "start": 472.599, "duration": 19.001}
{"chunk": "here right and then I would have that angle coming into the ball or like playing baseball oh yeah okay so very similar third feel I got to give credit", "start": 482.12, "duration": 18.240000000000002}

{"chunk": "lateral thrusty chest kind of out on the horizon in his main feel for me I want he said I want you to feel like your chest is", "start": 534.88, "duration": 17.880000000000003}

{"chunk": "know hips back or hinge but for me it was much more the middle of my chest I think he even told me I want you to imagine there's a light beam out of your", "start": 577.6, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "chest or your sternum okay so maybe like an Iron Man feel which we've talked about before I want you to feel like that light beam points down towards the", "start": 586.48, "duration": 19.96}

{"chunk": "and I played really really well uh those two rounds maybe two of the better rounds I've actually played as a in my career so those are my three feels I got", "start": 648.12, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "the the head behind the ball the right wrist angle which matches up beautifully with what you coach and the chest as well it matches up beautifully so when", "start": 656.76, "duration": 18.439}
{"chunk": "when we met it all just SN to me I'm like I already teach this and know this and feel this so your philosophies just", "start": 665.8, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "matched up I was like I got to go work with him all right so let's take a closer look at some of the changes I made on", "start": 673.959, "duration": 18.442}
{"chunk": "the left this was in 2015 um I'd been out of college about a year and on the right uh was roughly a year a year and a half ago with Milo um out at", "start": 682.56, "duration": 17.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "Superstition Mountain camera is not perfect on both these so just keep that in mind but you'll get a good look at what's kind of changed over that time", "start": 692.04, "duration": 16.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "frame so number one on the left you can kind of see here I started out with a little bit of a posture issue there uh a little bit of anterior pelvic tilt", "start": 700.32, "duration": 17.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "extension in the lumbar spine so much flatter here on the right um so just a little bit of a setup difference there but here we go so let's look in the the", "start": 709.36, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "back swing you can already see that pelvis moving a little bit in towards the ball so my chest is already not as", "start": 718.36, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "on top as I would like it one of those keys I talked about get up to the top and now you're really going to see that", "start": 727.04, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "right hip drive up and in and from face on you would see a fair amount of lateral so you see that chest is more up", "start": 733.8, "duration": 19.159}
{"chunk": "and down than I would like at that that frame there now the handle is going to get high my right arm really extends and", "start": 743.16, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "I get a little bit more roll and this is when I was struggling with a bit of a a hook and it looks like this one hooked pretty good so that gives you kind of a", "start": 752.16, "duration": 18.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "good idea of what I was trying to get out of my swing so now if we go to the right you're going to see I'm going to stay a little bit more in my bends and", "start": 761.04, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "the back swing so now my chest is a little more on top I already have a little bit more angle here compared with that older swing where I've kind of", "start": 770.639, "duration": 21.561}
{"chunk": "moved more Off the Wall per se so now in transition you're going to see my chest stay on top or even my head even lower a", "start": 779.88, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "little bit and now I keep those angles better I keep my depth better keep this space handle returns in", "start": 789.36, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "a better spot when I'm swinging well this is this is just one swing so I tend to fall back to this pattern that's what", "start": 798.16, "duration": 15.641}
{"chunk": "I keep having to work on um but you can see the the vast differences there when it is working well and um again the the", "start": 806.16, "duration": 19.679}
{"chunk": "difference too in the release pattern and the the club face being able to hit that shot I'd like with a little bit", "start": 815.92, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "less um of that draw hook pattern or vice versa when I stand up into it now I get that block that I mentioned earlier", "start": 823.68, "duration": 17.08}

{"chunk": "go awesome okay so here's what I want to do I want to put these three feels together though so we're going to put this camera face on and I want to show", "start": 857.44, "duration": 19.319}
{"chunk": "everybody how my chest is kind of the the driving force I to me my feel is Dustin Johnson I feel chest on top on", "start": 867.0, "duration": 19.399}

{"chunk": "to get in into impact so I'll just do one slow so you can see that feel through", "start": 923.56, "duration": 16.162}
