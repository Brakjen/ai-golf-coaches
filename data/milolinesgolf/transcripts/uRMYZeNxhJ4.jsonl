{"chunk": "okay let's talk about how the trail hand wrist extension is key to shaft lean and covering the ball sounds good", "start": 0.06, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "to get started with this I want to talk a little bit about a study that was done on a tour players and their grips what this study found is that the lead", "start": 13.44, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "hand is very variable you guys might have heard me say this before maybe you know you can see it with a camera and", "start": 22.08, "duration": 15.418999999999999}
{"chunk": "measured evidence measured evidence yeah so the the lead hand varies from extremely strong too extremely weak but most players lie", "start": 29.22, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "in the middle there but more of a neutralist grip however what they found with the trail hand was interesting and the trail hand generally lines up so", "start": 37.559, "duration": 18.539}
{"chunk": "that it matches the club face it was basically a hundred percent of the players and how it explained a neutral right hand grip was that their right hand", "start": 46.379, "duration": 17.941}
{"chunk": "matches that club matches the club face exactly so since we know that the right hand matches the club face now this makes squaring the club face fairly", "start": 55.559, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "simplistic simple if the right hand matches the face then the right hand just has to be square at contact that's the goal that's the goal right if the right hand is open then the ball is", "start": 64.799, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "going to go right if the right hand is closed then the ball is going to go left if assuming that face the hand matches the face yes well we're hoping that's what we're teaching where everybody's", "start": 73.439, "duration": 17.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "going to match the right hand of the face now if I want to create less Loft what then would the right hand need to", "start": 82.02, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "do extension extend and we know that good players deliver less Loft than what is on the golf club for example I'll use", "start": 89.88, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "John ROM because I've seen some of his numbers when he's hitting a middle iron he's delivering between an 11 and 13 degrees less Loft", "start": 99.0, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "than the Loft that the golf club has so that means that there is 11 to 13 degrees of retained wrist extension", "start": 106.92, "duration": 17.099}
{"chunk": "at contact that's just boil it down to simplistic terms yeah so that's what there is I'm similar maybe even a little bit more", "start": 115.799, "duration": 17.101}
{"chunk": "lean than what he produces so why is that critical for us to be able to compress that golf ball well well our goal is to provide depending upon your", "start": 124.38, "duration": 20.219}
{"chunk": "speed a loft that matches for you to maximize compression yeah and not only will it go straighter but you'll hit it much farther so let's go down that", "start": 133.98, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "rabbit hole just a little bit you've all seen my swings on video most likely and you've seen it impact how there's a significant amount of lean in the shaft", "start": 143.28, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "is that right for everyone should everybody have lean in the shaft like Milo Lines no because not everyone has your speed so obviously the less speed", "start": 152.58, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "you'll produce yeah you can still do this problem is you'll never get it off the ground so your golf shots are going to look like low punches that don't hold", "start": 161.459, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "greens if if you're a low speed player who has lots of shafting right so if you're a high speed player you better be providing some shaft lean or a", "start": 170.519, "duration": 17.941}
{"chunk": "significant amount if you're a high speed player and why is that because if you don't you're hitting it to the moon yeah because the ball just goes straight up spins up into the air and it's hard", "start": 180.06, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "to control your distances the wind gets your ball and we saw that yesterday and there's one student we had yeah yep exactly we want lean to varying degrees", "start": 188.819, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "depending on our speed but we all want some lean we all want to have some amount of retained wrist extension okay exactly how do we get it the way we do", "start": 196.86, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "it is we always talk about when we get to about waist height ish as this right wrist starts to go into a little radial and extension in transition we start to turn this", "start": 206.04, "duration": 19.018}
{"chunk": "doorknob keeping extension all the way down into impact from here and then we allow it to release over here okay so let me walk through this slow for", "start": 215.459, "duration": 17.701999999999998}
{"chunk": "everyone I'm just going to do it with Trail hand only so I swing this back my wrist starts to extend", "start": 224.7, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "I've completed my turn now as I change directions can you see can you all see this subtle motion right there does that look right Ed yep that's about right", "start": 231.84, "duration": 19.38}
{"chunk": "okay so there's a little bit of the doorknob turn the shaft is shallowing out just a little bit", "start": 241.5, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "now the key here is I've got to take my whole left side and I've got to be able to take it and turn it around the corner so that my left side moves my loaded", "start": 248.64, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "wrist all the way back to the golf ball and that really is the key so if what happens if I don't do that", "start": 259.32, "duration": 15.481000000000002}
{"chunk": "what happens if my left side turns off then you know you are going to jump and extend that wrist to get that club to", "start": 266.58, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "that ball 100 of the time okay so the things that have to be married together if we want to have that nice Trail wrist extension that produces the lean in the", "start": 273.9, "duration": 18.539}
{"chunk": "shaft is we've got to marry it with inside getting out of the way getting out of the way okay that's what I wanted to cover here now Ed we had to set up", "start": 283.199, "duration": 16.019}
{"chunk": "the camera face on for just a second so we can demonstrate this because a video is not a video unless a golf ball gets whacked and it shows what we're trying", "start": 291.479, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "to do okay so I'm I'm gonna do this fairly slowly so that the camera can catch everything but what we're after", "start": 300.18, "duration": 15.06}
{"chunk": "again is changing directions with a little bit you can see my wrists how they are", "start": 307.62, "duration": 15.721000000000002}
{"chunk": "working with my Pivot and now my lead side just goes around the corner so let's see if that if I can actually make that happen", "start": 315.3, "duration": 15.88}
{"chunk": "okay that's pretty good I'll bet it is beautiful I think I think that that ties it all together in a nutshell so hopefully you guys have all liked this", "start": 326.94, "duration": 16.5}
