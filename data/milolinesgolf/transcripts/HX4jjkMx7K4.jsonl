{"chunk": "let's walk through the keys to being able to make this move correctly key number one we have to wind ourselves up correctly", "start": 156.239, "duration": 16.44}

{"chunk": "our tailbone work around behind us so those are the main keys I wanted to focus on in this video there are other keys to make this work", "start": 199.62, "duration": 15.538999999999998}
