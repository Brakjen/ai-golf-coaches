{"chunk": "it's a drill y that I've seen many of the best players in the world use and what this field does for you is it helps", "start": 86.32, "duration": 15.56}
{"chunk": "you learn to make the golf club work around you a little more efficiently one of the problems we see from players at home is that the club kind of gets all", "start": 94.64, "duration": 15.28}

{"chunk": "baseball not really it's a subtle change but they are getting that bat in the zone early so then they can turn through", "start": 185.08, "duration": 16.041}

{"chunk": "corner here so what's a a simple drill that we can use to learn to feeling so perfect", "start": 211.08, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "one I really like and Brooks kkus talked about it is to hit balls or just make some air Swings with the ball above your", "start": 218.92, "duration": 19.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "feet yes I just have my own routine that I do um probably spend the first hour just kind of hitting balls just kind of getting loose doing my own thing and", "start": 228.92, "duration": 15.159}
{"chunk": "then there I go work on my swing stuff I get on a little side slope and do what I you know work on my mechanics of getting in the right spot and then uh what does", "start": 236.599, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "practicing on a side slope do for your swing just for me for my swing I just ball above the feet it gets my back swing in the correct position where I can lock it down and really try to feel", "start": 244.84, "duration": 16.599}
{"chunk": "like I have to hold it off where um my body's got to keep moving why because it tends to get up into yeah if it just gets too upright you just want to flatten it a little bit right because you're hitting it up here now it's", "start": 253.079, "duration": 16.162}
{"chunk": "almost like a big yeah exactly and then just making sure the only way that ball can go straight is if I actually turn through the golf ball right well because the tendency am I understand the", "start": 261.32, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "tendency is kind of that but turning through is what forces that exactly pretty much I just feel sometimes that left shoulder gets a bit high and I can get under as far as you know trying to", "start": 268.6, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "feel like my chest really rotates towards that Target right yeah turn and B so Henry I'm going to show you what I want you to do and for those of you at", "start": 277.479, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "home watching you can see Henry and I are pretty close to the same height not anymore this is a very severe slope so", "start": 285.44, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "if if I was swinging my driver off of this slope the ball's going to be almost knee high yeah so it's it's a pretty", "start": 293.84, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "high ball it's extreme yes but this extreme setup what it's going to do for me is it's going to teach me what it feels like to make the club work around", "start": 301.68, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "more because if I do something where I drop the club under the ground's in the way or if I'm over it the ground's in the way again so now I need to learn to", "start": 311.759, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "feel that club orbit around me and what I noticed too is that you're not even hitting the ground you're just", "start": 320.639, "duration": 15.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "you might be sweeping the grass sure I could hit balls right off of a tea right there no problem yeah what's kind of interesting though is I'm watching you I", "start": 328.8, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "see the grass moving just a bit back here and I also see it moving just a bit over here so that tells me your driver", "start": 338.199, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "is pretty flat to this earth it's TR a good yard or so it's not yeah going down and up it's it's", "start": 345.36, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "just swinging on a nice shallow Arc around me so would you say there's a misconception out there with driver that maybe people are trying to really hit up", "start": 356.0, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "on it or maybe they're kind of new to golf and they're swinging really down on it they're hitting the ground early and they get those pop flies or those slices", "start": 364.0, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "you can see a lot of slices with that pattern yeah I think one of the big misconceptions I see is that you need to hit really up on your", "start": 372.12, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "driver because what that creates is improper ways of hitting up on the driver we do want to hit up on the driver some depending on how fast you", "start": 379.24, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "are you might want to hit up on it a lot but you don't want to tilt back to try to do it yeah we're going to still feel", "start": 387.84, "duration": 15.799000000000001}
{"chunk": "this swing working more or less what feels level around our body the only reason we catch it on the upswing is where the ball's at in The Stance yeah", "start": 395.759, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "the ball's a little forward so our low Point happens somewhere slightly behind the ball gotcha so Henry I want you to jump in here and feel that", "start": 404.759, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "okay oh that is really above my feet yeah I'm for once I'm finally tall it's so funny though because I've done", "start": 414.08, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "this drill a zillion times with students and honestly it's got a lot of benefits I remember a a junior golfer I taught up at Sugarloaf in Maine where I formerly", "start": 422.24, "duration": 19.48}
{"chunk": "work this was like seven years ago and this kid he jumped and early extended more than any of you did at home I promise you he was like he was a world", "start": 432.56, "duration": 20.68}
{"chunk": "record Setter oh it was unbelievable but I had him swing off a slope and the first few times he was digging Earth it was so funny drop kick bounce into the", "start": 442.4, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "ball but he started to understand okay it is a little bit like baseball the club is working around us a little more he started to understand the radius a", "start": 452.24, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "little bit we we talk about the radius control and for the rest of the school he started out driving all the other kids and he started hitting driver", "start": 460.28, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "really really well so he stopped jumping up to the moon and this drill really really helped them so it's one I've used a bunch and we use it our at golf", "start": 469.24, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "schools sometimes with people that really struggle driver but if you're a slicer this is a great place to start because right you can't you out over", "start": 477.72, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "you'll hit the ground so and one analogy I like that you use is talking about like if you had a", "start": 485.44, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "telephone pull in your hands because driver you're really stepping up in length from a wedge to a driver that's it's a big difference so we still want", "start": 493.96, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "to turn in bends but you got to understand this driver being so long it is kind of like you have a totem pole and if the totem pole was down here well", "start": 502.039, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "it wouldn't go in the ground so you got to have that feeling a little bit your arms are going to elevate up a little bit so that they can go around you a little better", "start": 510.599, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "exactly perfect so it is a little bit flatter we have to understand that and it's really going to help you guys hit driver more solidly and", "start": 518.64, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "consistently we can't hit the ground that is like the biggest no no with driver can't hit the ground perfect so now that we understand that we can make", "start": 528.0, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "some swings on this slope how can we transfer these feels into something a little closer to golf I got an idea", "start": 536.92, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "let's go back up okay okay so we're back on the mat where we're going to hit Henry the way I want you at home to start feeling how to transfer from a", "start": 544.399, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "ball above your feet to a ball and a te to hit your driver maybe we start with some practice swings above this ball oo", "start": 554.079, "duration": 16.121}
{"chunk": "I like it so very much baseball swing so yeah here I am normal let's say on the ground so imagine this ball is twice that high it's right there there you go", "start": 561.2, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "and just swing above it and club's going around you beautiful okay so funny when I have", "start": 570.6, "duration": 15.441}
{"chunk": "people first time do this drill they go like this and they just hit it they're like what did I do cuz they can't they can't", "start": 578.12, "duration": 17.678}
{"chunk": "understand the concept of keeping that radius keeping that height of the driver so this is why like I like", "start": 587.519, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "to imagine like there's if that ball was there again it's like there's a paint of glass under that so I know Hogan talked about this paint of glass I'm looking at", "start": 594.959, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "it like there's glass right here if I hit that glass I'm falling right so I got to keep that driver above that", "start": 604.079, "duration": 18.681}
{"chunk": "glass okay let's see one more I'll stay above it yeah so right now there's glass between my driver and the ball and I can't bust through that glass I got to", "start": 613.64, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "keep that driver above it right so it's like almost like a table there so that's the feeling and", "start": 622.56, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "the way I like to progress through this is we start with the club swinging you know some 2 three inches above it gradually lower it and then clip one", "start": 630.36, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "where you hit it on the bottom of the golf club you're going on purpose you're going to make me top it like those they have those challenges going on on tour now saw Rory hit one like a couple yards", "start": 638.68, "duration": 18.999}
{"chunk": "so you can top it the shortest that was pretty good actually yeah you topped it you nearly poked my out with the tea look at that so I got right on the bottom", "start": 647.399, "duration": 19.721}
{"chunk": "of that club yeah okay so now your radius you're you're gaining control over that radius okay so now you can lower it just a little more and hit it", "start": 659.44, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "in the face so I'll get this feeling right yep and then I got to drop it down just let it fall down just a little more", "start": 666.959, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "and there we go now those are you at home hopefully you could see that golf ball flying it was a low bullet little", "start": 674.72, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "low straight laser beam mhm and that's honestly the drill I like to warm up with for you and and I you know we hit", "start": 683.6, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "it pretty far so there's a lot of ranges in all honesty we can't hit Driver full there's a lot of ranges are only maybe what 280 300 yards long so for us", "start": 691.639, "duration": 18.961999999999996}
{"chunk": "hitting little bunters like that we call them it's even if I was at a full range where I could let it go I'm going to hit a lot of those shots yep because it gets", "start": 701.2, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "me really good control of the club face I feel very stable and I'm getting the radius I want so I know okay am I hitting a little", "start": 708.959, "duration": 17.561}
{"chunk": "heel side am I hitting a little toe side low high I know and then I can progress through that slowly until it feels", "start": 718.0, "duration": 15.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "matched up perfect that's my goto drill right there is that feeling I don't necessarily go to a hill and get balls above my feet that's the feeling I do", "start": 725.279, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "the same thing I call it my ladder drill I ladder myself to speed every time I want to go play because yeah I'm getting older I can't just go straight to full", "start": 734.0, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "speed it hurts yeah it takes me a minute another one I like to do Milo is is hit driver off the deck and I challenge some students to do this it's it's a really", "start": 741.0, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "hard drill but it's great practice you might thin it you might top it you might chunk it at first but if you can start to get it without getting excessively", "start": 749.6, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "down or trying to help it in the air you start to understand how to get that nice flat bottom like we want the best players in the world can hit their", "start": 759.519, "duration": 17.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "drivers off the deck I see them do it in PGA Tour events with money on the line big time so you know it's a skill know's", "start": 768.32, "duration": 15.879000000000001}
{"chunk": "really good at this is Brooke Henderson on the lpj tour we've played with before and she just she can hit 250 in the air", "start": 776.6, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "probably off the deck it's crazy well let's see if you can do it yeah oh baby", "start": 783.519, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "hello I don't think Brooks got that one but that was pretty good that was a little that almost got to the other side that was a little laser beam so but I didn't feel anything different that's", "start": 806.32, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "the important part is that whether that that I have that really high te or I have it off the deck the feeling is the same I just adjust my plane through a", "start": 815.92, "duration": 21.76}
{"chunk": "little bit of setup exactly and even the ball position stayed relatively the same you didn't move it farther back because it was on the ground right you just", "start": 826.16, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "change how yep we can mess with our height if this club was 40 feet long I'd have to stand like this I couldn't stand like", "start": 835.04, "duration": 19.718}
{"chunk": "this yeah okay Henry so before you hit this one I want you to walk them through the entire process maybe even including a little pre-shot routine how you can", "start": 844.279, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "learn to incorporate these Concepts into their motion okay so yeah we I'd kind of Step Up In Here number one we get that ball", "start": 853.639, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "position pretty far forward driver is going to be more like left shoulder is pass the shirt logo probably but I'm going to get this", "start": 861.8, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "feeling of here I am if I'm normal I like to hover the driver a little bit that could also be something you guys do at home um just so you you have to", "start": 869.68, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "understand when you have driver off the ground here in the swing if I go up the driver tends to want to go out too M so that can compromise your strike so yeah", "start": 879.24, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "so that's why I like to kind of hover it for the most part yep especially if I have a high te like that you're already presetting that radius a little bit you're not having to make some kind of a", "start": 888.04, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "compensation midswing right so like down the line you guys can see if that's about Center more or less from the ground well if I raise that up it's actually on the heel y so that can be", "start": 897.24, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "something to consider um but anyways I like to kind of feel like I'm hovering so now I'm going to I'm going to get that driver up", "start": 906.24, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "but I'm not just doing it with my hands I'm not standing up like this I'm kind of everything's sort of together so I kind of get up here make those sort of", "start": 913.519, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "baseball feeling swings doesn't even have to be full just getting that Arc where I want it then I have that feeling and I can walk in and now I have", "start": 921.92, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "that radius the way I want where I can just sweep it right off the top pretty solid right there oh yeah", "start": 931.759, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
