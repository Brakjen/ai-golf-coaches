{"chunk": "today we are talking about the ladies major champions and their golf swings and doing a little analysis of the swings we see", "start": 0.08, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "so first up is the champion of the a a inspiration the a a inspiration is going", "start": 14.16, "duration": 15.758999999999999}
{"chunk": "to be changing its name next year okay i think it's changing to chevron well anyways first major of the year shore yeah", "start": 21.199, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "patty and her last name is patty tenet tavatana kit okay i can't say that anyway let's get into her golf swing and see what it looks like see if she it's", "start": 30.48, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "really good it is good we're going to draw a couple lines here so we've got her line on her back side", "start": 40.0, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "lying on the top of her head and one out on her forehead just to get an idea of", "start": 48.16, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "how her body moves in space so we missed her backswing oh the camera's moving this is not going to work oh yeah well i guess i will delete the lines and", "start": 56.64, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "we'll just walk through what she's doing because the lines will wander well that's a good point about camera angles when you guys are doing your own", "start": 65.6, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "swing analysis at home or like members of our site we're pretty uh dialed in what on how specific we'd like it yes but", "start": 73.2, "duration": 17.519999999999996}
{"chunk": "what you can really see here is how high those hands get yeah so at the top of her swing she's got her hands way up high nice and high she's got a", "start": 81.92, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "little left bend you can see her pelvis has got some inclination but it's not drastically", "start": 90.0, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "inclined yeah so she doesn't i didn't get to see her her setup so i can't tell how much how much anterior tilt she has but my guess just looking at how she's moving", "start": 97.439, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "through space she didn't have a ton and it's very symmetrical looking golf swing reaches the top her left wrist", "start": 107.119, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "looks like it might just be a haircut and the face looks like it might be a hair open it's a little blurred so it's hard to see", "start": 116.0, "duration": 16.958000000000002}
{"chunk": "but what i'm looking at here is the flow of motion how she moves and how she sequences so you can see the transition she re-squares up really fast", "start": 124.479, "duration": 19.442}
{"chunk": "so she's back to square before hands even get back to parallel to the ground yeah so earlier than what we see in most men and that's pretty common amongst the", "start": 134.16, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "women they seem to be a little bit more spinny yeah they don't put as much force into the ground they use more spin yeah she definitely", "start": 142.4, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "doesn't i would say sit as much as maybe some of the guys do yeah but i will say watching on tv that week and seeing her", "start": 150.959, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "in person on driving ranges she's one of those that when you watch her swing to me it kind of looks like it's like it", "start": 160.879, "duration": 17.522}
{"chunk": "she sets it and then she just unwinds it's it's like there's a brief pause and then go and just sort of unwind so i'm gonna look at it at full speed so i can see", "start": 169.2, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "the flow of it to me it's a it's a hair of a one two versus flowing yeah if that makes sense a little", "start": 178.4, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "kind of hideki-ish almost a little slow down and then go right but it's really good she like hideki her pelvis actually works up", "start": 187.92, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "a little sooner than my preference but the the sequence of motion how her body moves is really good she squares up really early", "start": 197.12, "duration": 18.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "at left arm or at shaft parallel she's back to square with her chest so the geometry is really neutral", "start": 206.959, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "what's her ball flight you know um i want to say she was hitting a high pretty high driver i can't remember if it was a draw or", "start": 215.36, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "fade from watching her it was pretty straight i mean the girls out there they don't really curve it that much um yeah they generally she's one of the", "start": 223.12, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "longest hitters out there and she's carrying her driver at least 270 so that's pretty big hit that's and long can see her spine bends nicely", "start": 231.12, "duration": 19.362000000000002}
{"chunk": "the way i like it to bend i just my preference is her pelvis kind of works up and into the ball a little bit more than i would like to see it but", "start": 241.84, "duration": 18.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "she matches it up pretty good and really hits you could see that she's going to hit the ball high by the way she's pushing up out of the ground yeah we're going to still kind of put my", "start": 251.439, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "lines on the side of the pelvis so we can see how she moves so you can see there's a little trigger a little move off the ball", "start": 260.4, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "but not a ton of slide forward she keeps her you can see her her front leg is angled away from the target at contact", "start": 268.08, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "which is one of the things i really like to see i really love her setup classic athletic setup yeah very classic", "start": 277.04, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "athletic setup kind of almost looks like the video we just did on athletic setup so really cool setup really cool move", "start": 286.72, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "not a ton of lateral but you can see definitely there's a little pressure moving nice wind up she stays inside of her", "start": 296.16, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "feet there's not a lot of slide and tilt yeah in the golf swing so it's pretty good you can see if you watch it again at full speed that flow is talking about though it's a little bit of a", "start": 303.68, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "once it's there at the top you know she gives it one second kind of just she collects herself and then goes just rips it's not", "start": 313.039, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "it's not maybe as flowing as some motions you've seen throughout history it's a little more i hate to say segmented because it's so", "start": 321.759, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "good but yeah there is a little bit of that the backswing is a little more deliberate it's what i would say she just kind of puts it in place and then goes kind of we kind of see a little", "start": 329.52, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "that and call more cow is going to swing also so a little of the similarity there it's she's not really swinging the club back", "start": 338.08, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "with any velocity she kind of just moves it up where she wants it and then goes yeah we'll move though okay so now we're doing the us open at the olympic club", "start": 345.36, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "and our winner was yuka sasso and for those of you who've watched this golf swing it's reminiscent of somebody else on", "start": 354.16, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "it looks very similar to a gentleman on the pga tour yep there's been some really good comparison videos with the two of them so rory", "start": 362.479, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "mcilroy and yuka a little shop tracer on this one yeah and i actually think yuka swing looks like rory swing looked like 10 years ago", "start": 370.88, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "yeah very much he's a little more across the line she's not really across the line here yeah she's more right on the money at the top with a flat left wrist", "start": 379.6, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "he's a little more cupped and across his move his move has changed a little bit over the last little bit her face is a little shut there at the top which i like", "start": 387.199, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "really that club really pitches back behind her you can see if we draw in the line here shaft plane there", "start": 395.84, "duration": 17.918}
{"chunk": "and at the same point in time you know you can see that it's even more about it it's more behind her on the way down i love her rotation and her rotation is", "start": 404.639, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "sweet she puts a lot of force into the ground you can tell by what her feet do so if we now this shot she wasn't hitting a driver but when she's hitting driver her", "start": 413.36, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "left foot comes unglued yeah she actually goes yeah yeah like what you see a lot of the long hitters do and she's not a very big", "start": 421.44, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "person no but she moves it right yep she gets it out there maybe not quite as far as like patty and nelly corda who will show", "start": 430.0, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "later but she gets it out there pretty good yeah now what i really love about her golf swing is this pelvis motion", "start": 439.36, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "so i'm just gonna highlight this for everybody because she does some things that i really like to see", "start": 447.599, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "and you'll see as she takes this club back her right hip pretty much stays on the wall but watch what happens in transitions you can see how there's a", "start": 456.479, "duration": 18.398}
{"chunk": "little added hip hip flexion in the little right in transition that little line on her that little seam line it doesn't move", "start": 466.319, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "it almost backs up a little you can see her phone or her whatever her scorecard yardage book in her pocket looks like it", "start": 475.919, "duration": 15.520999999999999}
{"chunk": "backs up just a little bit i'm gonna get a chair so they can see so it just got right glued on this chair and then she gets", "start": 483.44, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "both squared up and she's not moving out when she does it right she almost as she transitions she almost for just a split second goes it goes", "start": 492.08, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "back a little farther yeah so it's like that right glute gets back and then it almost goes just a little bit more back in transition and then she unwinds", "start": 500.0, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "which it's a really awesome move so for you guys at home that chair drill can be a good one cool", "start": 508.96, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "so i love that now let's look at her face on what i notice about her swing face on she has one of the least lateral", "start": 516.479, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "motions of any of the players on the lpga tour it looks more like what we see with long drivers we can get a a good sense of what she's doing in this golf", "start": 525.2, "duration": 16.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "swing i'll put a circle around her head okay so as she takes the club back but you can really see how her her head", "start": 533.279, "duration": 17.522}
{"chunk": "is kind of wandering right and here at the top of her backswing she's got some angle away from the target which i really actually like to see that that's kind of", "start": 548.0, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "reminiscent of tiger back in 2000 and her pelvis definitely did stay centered you can see it's not getting outside of her feet there's not a lot of", "start": 556.88, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "lateral there yeah and then she lands now that's pretty sick right now that is pretty cool she lands and there's no", "start": 565.44, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "that left hip doesn't even go forward hardly at all it just boom like that home run hitter yeah and she goes after it like when you", "start": 574.72, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "watch her in person like her tempo when you look at like we just did patty where's a little bit more", "start": 582.64, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "deliberate back kind of set and then go i mean yooka's just like wham wham just like goes after it i'm going to draw in", "start": 590.16, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "a line on her belt line so that everybody can see what happens in transition here see how her belt goes under the line", "start": 598.56, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "yeah that's kind of the rory squat she has that same little end of the ground and really turning that that's very reminiscent of what we see a long driver", "start": 608.32, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "doing this is a really dynamic action pretty cool move you've been having i love it imagine what she would do if she was six foot one or two like some of the other", "start": 617.2, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "girls out there she'd put it out there farther enough she's she's still really young so yeah wouldn't surprise me if she", "start": 627.519, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "started to win a couple times a year oh here we can see that footwork too so you can see her heel replants see that replant a little closer like i talk", "start": 635.76, "duration": 16.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "about with the dynamic players and then watch how it jumps off the ground and spins back she's using we've talked about this", "start": 643.6, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "before there's another um girl in the peach the lpga her name is bianca oh yeah that one i can't pronounce her last name i'm so", "start": 651.92, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "sorry but anyways what she does she's probably the longest hitter on tour what she does so well is she gets into the ground but then she's she's using", "start": 660.48, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "actually the ball of her foot and even her toes they're almost like talons and this is kind of what yooka's doing too where she she gets into the ground like that and", "start": 668.8, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "then and then just unwinds and rips that front side to really rip out of the way like that yeah so a lot of you at home are trying to", "start": 677.12, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "fall into your heel or fall into the outside of your foot but in reality you see a lot of these guys they actually are getting mostly in the middle or the ball of their foot to start with and", "start": 686.16, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "then then it circles back if they don't jump off the ground but the ones who actually jump off the ground they keep using that ball and they actually will push that yeah it's like gripping with their toes", "start": 695.92, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "or something so cool cool so next up we have the kpmg ladies pga championship", "start": 704.72, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "and our winner there was nelly corda and she had a pretty good year she right here she did okay and", "start": 713.36, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "for me she has a very aesthetically pleasing golf swing it's very good how tall is she now", "start": 721.04, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "probably i mean she's got to be six feet i would say she's tall six one those quarter sisters are tall yeah and again you can see as she takes the", "start": 729.36, "duration": 15.678}
{"chunk": "club back her pelvis this camera rings a little off so it's really hard to see but her pelvis stays back and then as she starts", "start": 737.519, "duration": 15.442}
{"chunk": "down she gains you can see her gaining flex her if she had a belt on that belt buckle would be going", "start": 745.12, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "toward the ball down so she's gaining hip flexion in transition and you can see she's really unwinding", "start": 752.959, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "it's very pivot centric she's not pulling that club down with her arms her pivot's driving her arms and slinging them and then her arms really do whip", "start": 760.56, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "out and accelerate and take advantage of that big frame and i would say like you know something we talk about on this channel all the time is flow", "start": 768.56, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "she may be she may have some of the best flow you see out of any of the players on the lpga is just you know you can really see it when you", "start": 777.2, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "watch her on tv or in person yeah she has great very long language just kind of but you know she's tall and", "start": 785.6, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "tall makes it look easy yep and she really sequences thing nicely doesn't move into the ball her pelvis stays out", "start": 794.0, "duration": 16.761}
{"chunk": "of the way but the flow of that motion she squares up by about left arm parallel by shaft parallel her chest is back basically square to the target line so", "start": 803.76, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "it's right in in line with what other great athletes do it contacts her pelvis is open you can see both pockets if she had pants on chest", "start": 812.56, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "is starting to open up she's got nice side bend yeah it's beautiful see your right arm under left but one thing to note with these these lpga", "start": 821.839, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "players is that when you watch them if you see an impact position or slow down at face on they're not going to have as much", "start": 830.8, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "shaft lean as some of the guys on tour and that has a lot to do with the club head speed right yeah so optimal amount of lean is different based on", "start": 838.72, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "speed so if if the average person put the kind of lean that you and i put into the shaft what would happen to their ball flight", "start": 847.6, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "uh be pretty low it would be really low on your stinger and it wouldn't stop it would be a roller right because they're not going to generate they don't gen enough spin they don't generate enough", "start": 855.199, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "lift to get that ball to launch out and then fall out of the sky with all the speed that we produced ladies are more in line with what the average person is", "start": 864.399, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "doing well and this is why you know watching these videos or some of the lpga players play is such a great thing because you start to see", "start": 872.32, "duration": 15.039000000000001}
{"chunk": "higher ball flights and and uh not necessarily driving it down so much right but you can see here", "start": 879.68, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "she's at like p5 and a half and you can see how her pelvis is already opening up very nicely", "start": 887.6, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "and by the time she gets to the ball come on give me the so by contact right there", "start": 895.839, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "you can see which way she's facing and it's not at the ball that's for sure she's yeah she's facing like that and often", "start": 905.839, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "one of the things i want to clarify is often people think that the chest or the shoulders are square to the target at impact or square to the ball at impact", "start": 916.0, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "it's not really true this just hurts yeah and here you can see it her shoulder her left shoulder is kind of", "start": 924.0, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "pulled out this way but her chest is turned if if this shoulder was pulled back her chest is pointed out here somewhere right and that's how every", "start": 932.16, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "pretty much every really good ball striker at contact that's what we see right so the chest is open but the reason the shoulders appear more", "start": 942.079, "duration": 15.520999999999999}
{"chunk": "square closed is because the club's got to get down the ball with the left arm that's one of the habits you're not gonna you're not gonna retract the shoulder blade and pull it all the way back it will shrug so it's more like", "start": 949.519, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "this and then the other thing you have to notice is there's some side bend so but this side bend my chest looks pretty", "start": 958.72, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "square right but in reality it's pointed way out there right exactly and you can really see that and then you can really see that here with her okay", "start": 966.639, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "henry so let's talk about the evian what's that called now it's evian it used to be the evian masters or something like that and it's", "start": 974.959, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "just evian champions everyone championship so minji lee won that golf tournament right", "start": 984.399, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "and i've done a major her first major i've done an analysis for us analysis of her golf swing before it's a pretty cool golf swing", "start": 992.399, "duration": 18.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "you can really see i think her swing is built a little more for precision than the last few swings we've seen yes", "start": 1001.759, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "not as not as long of a hitter when we played with her in a practice round it was it was just more machine like more precision like", "start": 1010.639, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "yeah she's not as long a hitter her swing is not as long all right and it's not as dynamic she's not she's probably not very big either is", "start": 1019.44, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "she about five five yeah five five so about average size but you can see there's really if we just look at this at speed", "start": 1029.199, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "there's really not a lot of pressure moving foot to foot she's just kind of turning it back and then she pivots out of the way really well", "start": 1038.48, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "and you can see how her the club moves kind of simultaneous or maybe the pelvis even moves slightly before the club right starts to move and it's almost", "start": 1047.76, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "like she's keeping it pretty wide she doesn't really create much like hinge or angle here it's pretty yeah she keeps it really wide yeah it", "start": 1057.44, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "almost looks like it even widens out a little bit like she's almost going a little this way yeah but pretty good wrist conditions oh yeah", "start": 1065.84, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "just not as much maybe and you can see right there one frame back this is cameras the shutter speed's so slow on these", "start": 1073.679, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "this is off tv i i'm guessing somebody has snipped it off tv well we wanted to get you guys some swings of them when they were actually winning and playing their best so you", "start": 1081.28, "duration": 18.718}
{"chunk": "can see right there at this point what her arm structure looks like she's got right wrist extension the shaft the club is behind her hands slightly and her", "start": 1090.559, "duration": 17.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "body's already open so her pelvis is open her chest is almost back square at that point in time and then she turns right into the ball", "start": 1099.12, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "at contact right there you can see her whole back yeah left pocket and her whole back almost all the way to her left shoulder so", "start": 1107.2, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "she's really around then that club's gonna go left and exit out under her left shoulder pretty cool swing", "start": 1115.84, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "and you can see as she takes the club back there's really not much of a trigger it's just kind of no turn it back yeah", "start": 1125.039, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "like i said i think i think her swing was more developed with precision and accuracy in mind right it wasn't", "start": 1132.48, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "it wasn't really my guess as a kid she wasn't really going after it and playing the power game yeah it looks it looks like a golf", "start": 1140.16, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "swing that would produce nice accurate shots but you can see the sequence here her hands are still working up and see that belt line start to go around yeah", "start": 1148.559, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "so that's a cool move and then you can see her right there just prior to contact the ball's still there but yeah you can see how she's", "start": 1156.24, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "really got around and it doesn't look like there's a lot of lateral motion there's just not a lot of right there's not a lot of flow and", "start": 1164.4, "duration": 15.038}
{"chunk": "pressure so she's not going to be quite as dynamic as she could be but she hits it far enough obviously she's she won evian so she's pretty good", "start": 1171.919, "duration": 18.522000000000002}
{"chunk": "[Music] you can see the bends in her body right there at the top of her swing she's got a little left bend you can see the creases on the left side of that shirt", "start": 1180.76, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "and then you see that real stretch as the left hip starts to go around the left shoulder doesn't really start to move for a bit now the all the wrinkles on the left side are", "start": 1190.0, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "gone and they probably switched over and on the right side now and you can't see the right side but pretty cool move kind of finishes a little bit over top", "start": 1198.4, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "heavy dude chest out in front of her foot yeah yeah yeah that's a a sign of somebody who is not trying to hit it that hard somebody", "start": 1207.52, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "who's really smashing it yeah they're more they're more back there backing up yeah cool okay so now we're going to the open championship yeah okay so anna", "start": 1215.36, "duration": 20.401}
{"chunk": "norquist at carnegie now i've stood next to anna and watched her hit balls a few times now she's a lot bigger than me she's a lot", "start": 1224.96, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "she might be six three six four somewhere yeah she's very tall and she's really not a not known for being a really long hitter she's kind of", "start": 1233.52, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "an averages hitter for lpga tour player she probably carries her driver about 250. which is fairly long but not like not like the longest no", "start": 1241.52, "duration": 18.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "not very long for a woman of her stature i think she falls more in that category of the player we just talked about was minji lee whereas the first three we talked about", "start": 1250.799, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "patty yucca and nelly are all a little bit more powerful a little bit more flowing more dynamic you can see here let's play this swing at full speed", "start": 1259.039, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "that's a it's a good golf swing it flows pretty good but it might be one of the best iron players out there she's a great iron player and she's been good for a long time", "start": 1269.039, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "but you can see she kind of puts the club into position i'm not going to draw any lines on any of these videos because every one of these cameras is very bad they're moving", "start": 1277.36, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "all over the place so lines are not going to do us much good but we can see the flow you can see from the top of her swing", "start": 1285.919, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "you can see how that left side just goes out of the way clears that around her hands come down a little bit more than many she's got", "start": 1293.679, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "really low hands coming down so as she reaches left or shaft parallel you can see how that uh", "start": 1301.679, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "her left arm is actually pointed almost toward her toes back this way instead of out toward the ball generally that's a what we see in", "start": 1310.4, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "players that are not swinging extremely hard at it not not not as powerful do you think part of that could also be too where", "start": 1318.0, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "one thing i kind of looked at and noticed with her is she doesn't really get a lot of extension in this trail leg in her back swing she's not really", "start": 1326.72, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "making this massive turn no she's kind of she's kind of just stable right and like you said almost the club just gets into position and she kind of just lifts", "start": 1334.4, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "the club up into position her lower half's very stable under her yeah so do you find with players like that there could be a tendency sometimes to", "start": 1343.2, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "have the hands try to get back low in front of them a lot of times the hands low is what they did in the backswing you can see her arm plane is pretty low it's under her shoulders yeah so there's", "start": 1351.76, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "lots of depth there okay and then as she changes directions her right arm moves out in front of her but her left arm kind of works this way", "start": 1360.799, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "down her chest yeah a little bit more instead of working more out toward the ball and that probably has a little bit to do with her grip", "start": 1370.159, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "being a little more neutral or weak yeah her grip is probably slightly on the weaker side [Music] hard to see here but we'll look at that from face on", "start": 1378.559, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "but all the you know i would say that this golf swing is very similar to justin rose to me i see a lot of justin rose in her golf swing", "start": 1386.799, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "pretty good golf swing i like the sequence of it her hand path is just a little bit more down", "start": 1395.76, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "her ball doesn't curve by the way it's like straight she hits string straight shots straight yes i watched her in person a", "start": 1405.679, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "few times on the range hitting next to her and i'm watching her ball go like this and my ball go like this [Laughter]", "start": 1414.48, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "but anyway awesome so now an interesting thing here about the target view you can see at a dress her arms are actually", "start": 1422.159, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "hanging down inside of her shoulder that's part of why her hands need to come down so much because some of it's how she sets up well and her grip like", "start": 1431.36, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "as you can see the glove logo is pointed close to straight out toward the yeah it's it's on the weaker end of things i wouldn't say it's the weakest we've seen but it's definitely not", "start": 1440.0, "duration": 20.159}
{"chunk": "you know it's not a stronger no but her hands definitely hang in yeah very underneath there yes very underneath her she's got a long body a", "start": 1449.919, "duration": 18.962}
{"chunk": "lot lot big torso there it looks like so her arms can just kind of dangle down now as we put this in motion", "start": 1460.08, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "you can see she's got nice lots of depth there and then her hand you can see that left arm comes back where it's pointed really", "start": 1468.72, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "down not so much out like we see with the really long hitters there usually the left arm is more pointed out toward the ball hers is pointed more down", "start": 1477.52, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "and her chest is definitely not as open as some of the others and that has to do with her grip you know she's got that weaker grip and she uses", "start": 1490.24, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "shoulder extension arm lowering to square the face up more than she does bowing the wrist and still opening up yeah just her pattern is just a little different you know what's really", "start": 1498.88, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "interesting with her is notice her head it almost looks like her head is pointed on the ball or even left", "start": 1507.919, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "target side of the ball doesn't it kind of her eyes are your head yeah she's almost like this yeah versus", "start": 1515.919, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "you see a lot of players right their head is kind of this way if anything uh-huh hers is the other way hers is almost like i can't even do it i'm like it's like", "start": 1525.279, "duration": 17.922}
{"chunk": "her yeah this way she's very like it's almost stacked a little bit but it's also still opening the target a little bit in a way yeah it's", "start": 1533.52, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "interesting but you can really see that shaft stand up and then watch in transition see that first move yeah that's pretty nice yeah", "start": 1542.24, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "i bet if we went through all these and actually looked at that we'd see that that's a common denominator amongst all of them yeah it says as that pelvis starts to open up", "start": 1550.48, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "the center of mass of that club pitches back pretty cool move i mean even for minji who was maybe throwing it just a hair it was", "start": 1559.679, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "shallowing out here it was still you know yeah and she was kind of minji was kind of throwing it at the same time she really rotates her pelvis a lot and she kind of", "start": 1568.48, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "throws the club away from her yeah and again for players with their club head speed right", "start": 1578.0, "duration": 15.599000000000002}
{"chunk": "they don't need to be having as much shaft lean as say dustin johnson right lexi might have the most shaft lean out on that tour but she's", "start": 1586.0, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "also probably one of the fastest out there so the thing about it is like again like you said earlier for for most golfers", "start": 1594.48, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "the average golfers male or female on tv go watch the women play because they're hitting it higher and they're launching it and they don't", "start": 1603.12, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "have to have so much of this they can get away with a little less that's an interesting thing we were just over at pain getting doing fitting with dana", "start": 1611.36, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "and we've got dana finkelstein lpga tour player hitting her driver and launching it at 19 and right next to her grant weight", "start": 1620.559, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "hitting driver launching at 11. yeah and you can see the difference she's definitely not leaning the shaft as much she's definitely hitting up", "start": 1628.159, "duration": 17.682}
{"chunk": "quite a bit more but she still does have what some would call toe where the club is actually hasn't passed her hands at", "start": 1637.76, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "contact so even though there's no lean in the shaft right it's not flipped past her right so that's a", "start": 1645.919, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "the key to that is just good sequencing and most of these pros have nice sequencing anything else you want to mention about any of these no i think that i you know", "start": 1655.44, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "again that's kind of the big point is when you watch the women on tv i mean it's a great way to see how the top players in the world are making", "start": 1664.32, "duration": 18.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "it work when they're only carrying it maybe 240 250 at the most there's a few outliers on but there's also we you know we", "start": 1673.679, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "with dana she's carrying her ball about 210 to 15 right and she's still competing out there so um it just goes to show you that there's", "start": 1681.76, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "there's other ways to get around the golf course a lot of ways to do it and not we're not all going to be dustin", "start": 1689.84, "duration": 15.979999999999999}
