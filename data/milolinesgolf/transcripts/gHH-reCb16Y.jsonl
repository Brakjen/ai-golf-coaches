{"chunk": "keep it more down and back yeah and through impact we'll link that video there's definitely something to be said about eye dominance in that scenario so", "start": 32.82, "duration": 16.8}

{"chunk": "power right away You're Gonna Do yeah what else did it do well I stalled out I hit it a little fat you hit it back I couldn't keep turning the corner yeah", "start": 83.1, "duration": 16.618}
{"chunk": "that's what I was getting at your body totally turned off yeah when you did that you your body turned off so all that went through was the hands", "start": 91.619, "duration": 18.241}

{"chunk": "get energy up and around the corner it's hard I don't think really hard it turns it off because your body doesn't want to finish what it was doing so that's why", "start": 118.619, "duration": 19.858999999999998}
{"chunk": "and you'll see those people that do try to keep their head down or maybe they succeeded it seems pretty powered by the", "start": 128.039, "duration": 16.201999999999998}

{"chunk": "talk about collecting the golf ball with your turn something we've talked about before their eyes are you know they're", "start": 241.86, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "they're following the plane essentially before they've even hit the ball they're like here yep so it's like really turning around the corner I can't", "start": 249.48, "duration": 20.039}
{"chunk": "even do it I do it by nature but you do it a little bit for sure not quite to the level that some of like Monica Monica oh man they're looking at that", "start": 258.78, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "rocket sign by the time they but that's something they've most likely developed at a pretty young age or when they started playing the game probably that could be an eye dominance thing for sure", "start": 267.96, "duration": 17.1}
{"chunk": "for sure and Dustin actually works on it with his short shots so he hits his wedges when he's hitting less than full shots he tries to make sure his head keeps turning", "start": 276.66, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "so that his body keeps turning yeah it feels like to me like my nose and this mic or my sternum are attached and I'm", "start": 285.419, "duration": 16.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "just going whoosh around the corner yeah so it's all and then the club is back here and I just I kind of Beat It to the", "start": 293.28, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "to the punch per se like that and keeps me moving yeah one one thing I wanted to talk about with you Milo the want to to", "start": 301.979, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "hit this golf ball stay down head down and hit the golf ball so the ball's there I got to go hit it right problem", "start": 309.72, "duration": 16.32}

{"chunk": "hitter they're not stuck on the ball obviously they see a ball coming right so they got to go up and get it and they're swinging through that ball yes", "start": 326.28, "duration": 17.1}
{"chunk": "so the through part I think that's why this video is important because whether you are left eye dominant right eye dominant whether you stay in it a little", "start": 334.74, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "more or whether you turn ahead of that of it at impact either way you see that relationship with all the best players they're moving through the shot they", "start": 344.16, "duration": 17.939000000000004}
{"chunk": "don't get stuck down at the ball yeah what's actually happening is they're accelerating the golf club clear through the golf ball yes they're not", "start": 352.86, "duration": 16.141}

{"chunk": "attention out here with where your energy is going versus everything going down into the into the ball so much I'm", "start": 377.1, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "gonna do one where I feel like I'm really moving up around the corner my speed is almost feeling out front and I'm just", "start": 387.0, "duration": 15.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "going to collect that golf ball the ball is essentially in the way ideally that's what it is it's in the way of my turn right", "start": 395.16, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "that was a flusher now how often do we see somebody come in they set up they make a flowing practice swing that's just yeah", "start": 404.88, "duration": 18.62}
{"chunk": "beautiful right no tension it speeds right out in front and then they step up to that golf ball and it looks like a Lurch", "start": 418.139, "duration": 16.419}
{"chunk": "it happens every day right see it all the time and I think it's it's hard because it's a psychological thing but a lot of it is their intent is", "start": 427.88, "duration": 18.7}
{"chunk": "that they want to hit at the ball they want to hit the ball making a swing where they're they're creating a a nice", "start": 437.22, "duration": 15.718}
{"chunk": "circle around their body with yeah with the momentum of that Golf Club so let's try a few where I'm just moving through it we've kind of done these step drills before", "start": 445.139, "duration": 18.781}
{"chunk": "and then I'm just gonna go in and ball's in the way so same flowing motion I brought into that ball another good little exercise you can do", "start": 454.38, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "turn the club upside down and make this butt end feel really heavy so scale one to ten on pressure I'm like one", "start": 462.84, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "and I want to hear the sound the whoosh more from ball up versus before that golf ball how about that one that's a", "start": 471.3, "duration": 18.658}
{"chunk": "good one so really gets you moving through to the Target and then take that feel into the shot let's see if I can", "start": 481.919, "duration": 17.961}
{"chunk": "make that whoosh out front you see I'm I've turned the corner my", "start": 490.919, "duration": 15.100999999999999}
{"chunk": "right shoulder is actually in front of my left shoulder I've gotten so around the corner versus how many people we see finish in here too many I'm out of air I", "start": 498.36, "duration": 20.398}
{"chunk": "gotta speed all out front Okay anything else you want to add to this I don't have anything to add to that I think that so our goal is not to put the", "start": 508.379, "duration": 16.861}
{"chunk": "energy at the golf ball our goal is to take the energy through the golf ball and actually have our maximum speed beyond the ball now in", "start": 516.899, "duration": 16.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "reality because we hit the ball in the ground if we measured the club head speed it's probably fastest just before contact it is before yeah but if we", "start": 525.12, "duration": 16.258}
{"chunk": "weren't hitting a ball if we were swinging at air it would be out here probably a little later it would be later because the ball on the ground do slow the golf club down", "start": 533.339, "duration": 18.122}
{"chunk": "so let's make that speed as late as we can by turning through the corner and watching that ball exit that's a good", "start": 541.8, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "feel I feel like you watch your exit you see how that even turns me up the plane I'm watching that ball get out away instead of just sticking in the", "start": 550.2, "duration": 18.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "ground so let me see if I can watch that ball exit here I could almost see where it hits the net when you do that yeah keeps you in posture too yeah it does good trick for", "start": 559.8, "duration": 18.703}
{"chunk": "that sweet so that's a bunch of really good things that happen from us allowing our head to swivel with our body on the", "start": 571.44, "duration": 16.86}
