{"chunk": "okay welcome to my backyard so today I would like to talk about the different kinds of golf", "start": 12.559, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "swings that there are out there there are a few different kinds of golf swings as you all know I'd like to break them into just two categories swings that are", "start": 20.439, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "more driven by body rotation and swings that are driven more by The Swinging of your arms the things that make make each of", "start": 28.72, "duration": 20.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "the these type of golf swings work are different so today we're going to talk a little bit about what makes each of these types of golf swing work and what", "start": 38.84, "duration": 15.639999999999999}
{"chunk": "to look for now you know there are some people that are totally body driven golf swingers", "start": 47.12, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "and some people that are totally arm swingers and then there's a blend in the middle some people are a little of each okay", "start": 54.76, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "so not me your golf swing is more of an arms driven golf swing what you're going to", "start": 63.64, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "be looking for is as we swing the club down you an arm driven golf swing is going to have a steeper arm swing and", "start": 71.84, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "the face is going to be more vertical in the downswing so it's going to be more of a like an axe chopping and your body moves along with", "start": 80.36, "duration": 16.598}
{"chunk": "that so your arms are going to move down with the face much more vertical the face isn't going to be turned down like this here we have John sendon golf swing he", "start": 89.759, "duration": 19.122}
{"chunk": "has a very arms driven golf swing and you can see here at the halfway down point the tow of the club is vertical", "start": 98.52, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "his left arm is fairly vertical and his shoulders are still closed that's a pretty Telltale sign of an arms swinger", "start": 106.24, "duration": 16.477999999999998}
{"chunk": "now as you see as he starts down into impact or as he reaches impact here his shoulders are still Square to the Target line and his right arm is fairly", "start": 115.159, "duration": 19.761}
{"chunk": "extended so he has rotated the club square with his arms cuz it's going to require much more", "start": 124.159, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "rotation through the hitting area now what what you have to be careful for is if you're an arms driven golf", "start": 133.52, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "swing if my arms start to work down and my body starts to rotate that creates kind of a very steep looking golf so an arms driven golf", "start": 143.2, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "swing your body is going to stay very quiet your shoulders aren't going to get open real early your hands going to come down in here that's what makes gives me", "start": 152.48, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "the ability to hit inside out under the ball so that golf swing is going to look something like this let me see if I can make one of those work", "start": 160.92, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "[Music] okay so that was a more of an arms driven golf swing now", "start": 189.44, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "the second type of golf swing is more of a body driven golf swing now there are some principles that apply for the bodybuilding golf swing now if you're", "start": 198.319, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "going to be a a a person who s brings the club more with your body what we're going to be looking", "start": 206.879, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "for is different geometry now in a body driven swing my arms I better not have a a vertical arm plane coming down that's", "start": 215.439, "duration": 16.522}
{"chunk": "not going to work very good that's going to create a very steep golf steep looking golf swing", "start": 224.92, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "you can see if I my arms work down and my body turns that's very steep so in the body driven golf swing my arm is", "start": 231.72, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "going to work more out here out in front of me and the club's going to be more behind me", "start": 239.439, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "now the club face in the body driven swing is going to be much more shut or parallel to my spine as you can see there so as I swing it", "start": 248.04, "duration": 18.999}
{"chunk": "down the way we get there is by rotating the face around the axis of the shaft it's a little different", "start": 257.6, "duration": 19.081}
{"chunk": "squaring mechanism than the arm swing so it's the face is more rotated here now from there all I have to do is continue", "start": 266.52, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "to rotate my body and I've got the face Square now another thing to look for is I don't want to feel like I'm pulling", "start": 275.16, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "with my arms so my arms are not moving first I want to feel like my arms are very passive in the body driven swing and that allows me to get the club", "start": 284.12, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "shallow if I start to pull with my arms you can see immediately that club gets really vertical so", "start": 292.479, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "see if I can make an attempt to the the body driven swing which is a little more natural for me and that that's kind of my athletic personality is to be a", "start": 301.479, "duration": 17.202}
{"chunk": "little bit more of a rotary type golf s okay that was now here we have Robert Garis gas's golf swing and there's a few", "start": 308.6, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "things to take note of he is more of a body driven golf swinger now you can tell this by the fact that when his Club shaft reaches parallel to the ground", "start": 338.28, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "again his shoulders have already squared up so this tells you his shoulders are going to be fairly open by the time he reaches impact and because of that his", "start": 346.759, "duration": 17.001}
{"chunk": "Club face is a little turned down you can see it's slightly closed or parallel to his spine angle so all he has to do is continue his rotation now", "start": 355.4, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "as he reaches impact you can see that his shoulders have are open and his right arm has remained fairly bent into", "start": 364.319, "duration": 20.759}
{"chunk": "impact so this will allow him to kind of maintain a hit through the ball as he extends his right arm so that face will stay fairly stable through", "start": 374.599, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "impact just a different way of squaring the face so I hope that gives a little bit of an idea of what to look", "start": 383.96, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "for I don't really have a preference on which one you use it's a matter of finding what your athletic personality is and learning to swing that how it", "start": 392.919, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "fits you so if you need any help with this come out and see me at Superstition Mountain I'd love to work with you", "start": 402.479, "duration": 18.001}
