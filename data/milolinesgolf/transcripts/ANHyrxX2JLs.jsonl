{"chunk": "perspective too down the line maybe you've been told to get the hands to work down drop down", "start": 203.04, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "okay the problem with that too I find is that now we have to add some slide and you still get this look anyway so the", "start": 210.78, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "down is happening more in our opinions from us flexing into the ground yeah would you say I would say the majority", "start": 219.0, "duration": 17.939}

{"chunk": "tag it here I like to show this so I can have both arms this is called internal rotation of my shoulders", "start": 268.62, "duration": 17.4}

{"chunk": "powerful Dynamic delivery position not one like this that's a big part of it yep they can go", "start": 327.539, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "back and look through a lot of our videos we talk about how we Flex into the ground how our spines move yeah this", "start": 337.259, "duration": 15.961}
{"chunk": "is all related so if I want to arrive in this delivery position we see from the best I've got a lot of right side Bend here", "start": 344.52, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "even though I'm not tilted so I don't have much tilt but I have a lot of right side Bend and that's what's driving my arms out in front of me and I also have", "start": 353.639, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "a lot of Hip Flex yeah so the appearance of those hands in front of the thigh a lot of it has to do with what our pelvis", "start": 362.1, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "is doing if it's getting a lot lateral while your hands aren't going to be on your thigh in that position or else you'd miss the ball right so they're going to probably be behind it so", "start": 369.72, "duration": 18.06}

{"chunk": "I think it's more complicated than that I think it's it's more of a full system of motion all tied together again an", "start": 414.419, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "exercise I like to do for this is sort of what I call a pump and go drill so I'm gonna basically come down to delivery position just like if I was", "start": 422.28, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "rehearsing impact except I'm going to rehearse delivery so sort of that that pump and go feel that club is staying back to my right a little bit it's", "start": 430.62, "duration": 17.700000000000003}
{"chunk": "actually a little behind my hands not way out in front and then my hands are sort of over my right thigh you probably notice I have a", "start": 439.44, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "little knee Flex I have some hip hinge my chest is sort of down over here and I got that nice wrist extension we talked", "start": 447.72, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "about as well so let's have you do the pump and go and hit one and we'll be able to slow it down and show the audience where your hands are", "start": 454.919, "duration": 19.88}
{"chunk": "at that shaft parallel point in time a little thin but not too bad let me hit one more so I want you to start at six", "start": 464.28, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "up through six make my back swing from that position then work back through that position let me see if I can slow it down a little bit so", "start": 475.319, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "foreign those are hard drills though oh they are definitely hard kind of keeps you coordinated having to go from here in", "start": 484.86, "duration": 16.579}
{"chunk": "the backswing and then in in down into the ball into impact so it's tough to synchronize it all but so that's where the flow comes in yeah but it for a lot", "start": 502.139, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "of people that'll feel so different from what they normally do yeah well they might not even realize unless they get on video that they're actually hitting it like this you know yeah that's like", "start": 510.66, "duration": 19.261}
{"chunk": "really common so to actually get down to here and hit a few short ones that's going to be like mind-blowing yep okay Milo so I showed", "start": 520.08, "duration": 19.020000000000003}
{"chunk": "them how to get to that delivery position why don't you show us real quick how to get from the hands above the right thigh and then over the ankle", "start": 530.04, "duration": 16.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "at impact how do you make that last little portion in Impact okay the big key is if I've", "start": 537.899, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "kind of landed and flexed down into the ground like this now all I'm going to do is I'm just going to take", "start": 546.12, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "and let my my lead side start to extend and keep turning and that turning will bring the club all the way into", "start": 553.32, "duration": 20.34}
{"chunk": "impact where the the grips over my My Lead Foot like that so you just keep the rotation going keep", "start": 564.36, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "it going that's it so I'll hit one here and you should be able to see that my hands are over my lead foot at contact", "start": 571.98, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "so the big key there is the rotation keeps going so as I'm turning through I'm not just getting to here jumping up and throwing", "start": 589.32, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "my hands at it I'm turning so I'm getting my left side to go around behind", "start": 599.04, "duration": 15.06}
{"chunk": "myself so versus pushing yeah so that's another question so it doesn't go from here and then here", "start": 606.18, "duration": 22.979}
{"chunk": "if you unwind do sort of that tailbone turn you've talked about and then start to push up and back that gets the hands", "start": 617.459, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "to that position and there's going to be a little bit of an unload just because of physics yeah you've created an angle you move the angle in a circle the angle", "start": 625.86, "duration": 17.759000000000004}
{"chunk": "wants to unwind it just physics that's what happens the key is we're sequencing it by creating Flex into the ground", "start": 635.1, "duration": 15.541}
{"chunk": "starting to unwind things and then keeping things unwinding not firing our hips laterally getting out in front of it and then having to figure out how to", "start": 642.48, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "Olay it yeah a lot of people want to hit that ball so this will if you slow down and do sort of this pump drill and then what Milo is talking about you're more", "start": 652.079, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "or less moving through the ball the ball is getting in the way of your Motion versus you consciously trying to hit something so hard yep so that's what we", "start": 661.68, "duration": 19.738999999999997}
{"chunk": "see a lot on the lesson tee as well so slowing you down is a big part so take some videos of your swing face on and", "start": 671.519, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "you know check out where your hands are sort of in P6 into impact p7 what's kind of happening what what are you seeing", "start": 679.079, "duration": 15.300999999999998}
{"chunk": "there and then if you're like man I really could use some help with this well that's why we have an online Academy mylinesgolf.com come check it", "start": 686.7, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "out and we'll show you step by step how you can achieve more of this look through the hitting area and get that", "start": 694.5, "duration": 17.059}
{"chunk": "ball going out and so up all right yeah", "start": 701.579, "duration": 5.721}
