{"chunk": "has it no one really cast it out there usually is some amount or a fair amount of angle coming down and even sometimes in the back swing there's a pretty good", "start": 58.359, "duration": 18.239}

{"chunk": "like a broom you could do it with a club gripped halfway down you could do it a lme stick anything that's really a shaft essentially but I would start slow now", "start": 316.72, "duration": 16.36}

{"chunk": "one way I see people cheat it the relationship I look for is really getting this this stick sort of lined up parallel with my chest so I got it", "start": 342.36, "duration": 16.76}
{"chunk": "parallel somewhere about here in the downswing and then I can keep turning with that all the way through so it's pretty parallel versus this one", "start": 350.68, "duration": 18.6}

{"chunk": "stum boom boom boom boom boom boom boom so it's kind of that late hit or delayed strike we've talked about speed out front however we want to phrase it but", "start": 369.479, "duration": 15.799000000000001}
{"chunk": "I've gotten pretty good where I can make some fairly fast swings here not hit", "start": 377.759, "duration": 15.16}

{"chunk": "used often with casters is I'll get them to set up far enough away from the wall where they could make an actual back swing so I can make a back swing and now", "start": 422.919, "duration": 17.201}

{"chunk": "these are brand new and I don't want to make them you could turn it upside down but for our purposes we're going to force you guys not to scrape up your Club yes so once I've now I'm I'm pretty", "start": 440.68, "duration": 19.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "close to the this wall so now if I land and I unwind you see it's not going to hit the wall there we go and so maybe you get a foam ball and you practice", "start": 449.08, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "hitting a foam ball or something it's a drill yeah but it's a good one to give you a new perspective a new map in your", "start": 458.199, "duration": 16.72}

{"chunk": "the wall if I if I may if I turn this upside down I might just kind of come in here already have it set and then I'll get it I won't change my angles I'll get", "start": 474.72, "duration": 16.838}

{"chunk": "this there's just no power in that I got to be able to brace myself myself and really strike that thing well in the secret it's all in the sequence power", "start": 525.36, "duration": 17.279}
