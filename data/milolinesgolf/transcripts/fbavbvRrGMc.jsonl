{"chunk": "hey guys welcome back to uh milo lines youtube milo henry today we're going to be talking another sort of sport frisbee yeah and some of", "start": 0.56, "duration": 19.678}
{"chunk": "the motions we see similar the golf swing all right milo so when it comes to frisbee", "start": 10.639, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "most of us kind of use our dominant hand right so i don't i throw lefty oh you do okay well for me i see i kind of like to", "start": 23.199, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "throw right if i'm playing this golf which is a popular sport now we see these guys there they can hook it", "start": 31.599, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "they check this thing like 300 yards i can throw it this way right handed but i can't throw a backhand okay so it's weird i can i can sling a", "start": 38.64, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "frisbee like a right-handed thrower but if i'm going to throw it for accuracy or playing catch with somebody i always throw that okay so perfect", "start": 47.68, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "comparison for the golf swing do you see any similarities there for sure for me it's it's almost exactly my golf swing it's just on a level plane instead of down", "start": 55.52, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "here most of the time so some of the similarities is the change of direction so i'm stepping as my arm", "start": 64.96, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "goes back once my foot lands my body starts to open up and my arm kind of gets pinned and then it sling shots off", "start": 72.08, "duration": 17.918}
{"chunk": "pretty similar so the sequence the sequence of motion is almost identical and the loading and unloading are almost identical the only difference is", "start": 81.119, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "in a golf swing i got two hands on this thing and in a frisbee throw i've got one so this arm actually will sling off and go around like this", "start": 89.36, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "so in a golf swing that would be over there so now if you can do a little uh backswing for us why don't we point you this way a", "start": 97.439, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "little bit okay if you make your backswing motion not what they call it in frisbee or disc golf but yeah make that", "start": 105.759, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "motion again so if you stop right here what about your your left arm though it's why do we have a bend here do we want that yeah", "start": 113.759, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "it's an extra lever see i would i don't know about you but there's times we've been told keep your left arm straight but as we've pointed out before", "start": 122.399, "duration": 18.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "it's kind of a fallacy isn't it yeah a lot of the best golfers don't really have a straight left arm right there are a few that do like rory's is pretty", "start": 131.2, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
{"chunk": "pretty straight but i would say that the majority don't yeah because you see some people some students trying to like almost hyper extend this well they're trying so hard", "start": 139.599, "duration": 18.722}
{"chunk": "to keep this thing stiff yeah that's the the the word stiff right it doesn't work very good when i stiffen it up", "start": 148.48, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "so so by having a little more supple there's almost like a little more flow to it yeah it turns it into more of like a whip so i can", "start": 158.08, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "slingshot it yeah now what about let's move down the arm here what about like sort of the wrist and hand motions the wrist well", "start": 166.56, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "the wrist and the frisbee throw goes from flexion to extension that's fairly similar to what happens in", "start": 174.319, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "a golf swing as well so this wrist is extended and then it's flexed that's a that's a pattern we see a lot", "start": 183.44, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "in golfers there's a lot of ways to release a golf club some guys release it more this way but a lot of players throughout history", "start": 191.76, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "went this way with it so i'm seeing i'm seeing a little maybe a little supination in that motion but it's definitely not like a rollover no it's not a if i rolled it with the frisbee", "start": 199.68, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "the it wouldn't fly parallel to the ground right so i want that thing to fly fairly", "start": 209.12, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "close to parallel to the ground it's kind of like the golf swing when i make this motion that can sort of bring about a hook or a", "start": 216.56, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "too much of a draw motion the face can really be shutting down so we might go left interesting okay so you're telling me that", "start": 225.04, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "the the sequencing of the the body motion and even the wrist motion is very similar", "start": 233.439, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "even the grip is pretty close huh to a certain extent do you i mean are you gripping it away in your palm no i'm holding my fingers but my it would be", "start": 241.28, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "more of a weak grip yeah so this would be more let's let's say in line with like us jordan spieth or maybe a ben hogan yeah well hogan's grip was", "start": 249.92, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "probably more neutral speech is pretty darn weak more cows is pretty weak roms is pretty weak so kind of like what they're doing and they would almost take this and be", "start": 259.759, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "like ah this is like my golf pretty similar and sweet's left-handed so it's probably pretty pretty easy for him yeah so yeah", "start": 267.919, "duration": 17.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "but the key here when when you look at these guys throwing the disc really long disc golfers", "start": 276.4, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "they're not just using their arm to throw it no that's like a pitcher throwing a baseball they it's pretty much everything in the kitchen sink involved in it right when", "start": 284.479, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "you really gonna throw one they're almost like happy gilmore too they even kind of stepped into it sometimes if i was gonna throw this as hard as i could i'd go", "start": 293.84, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "like this like a crossover so like this would cross behind and so now could i almost take that feeling", "start": 301.84, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "of throwing this frisbee where my arm kind of slings off i got the wrist and the body feeling could i go in and hit a shot with just my left", "start": 312.32, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "hand sure it'd be pretty hard i mean i but even that one i felt like i tipped it out a little bit", "start": 320.72, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "so i almost have to go slower to do it gonna have to go slow at first but you can hit one-handed shots fairly well lefty john daly does it up very well that one i just got i felt like my", "start": 332.479, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "body went ahead sooner yep so that was more of the right sequence so your body got out yeah the step happened earlier", "start": 341.6, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "how about i add a step to it that'd probably be pretty good there you go that's pretty tough to hit it's all done you hit it on the toe but", "start": 349.6, "duration": 18.279}
{"chunk": "you did pretty good the only problem i have with that is i feel like something about doing it with my non-dominant hand makes it it makes it", "start": 357.919, "duration": 17.322}
{"chunk": "really really challenging i probably wouldn't do that one that often i would stick more if i was to do one-handed ones to the trail arm", "start": 374.08, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "because that's something i mean for me that's my dominant one but but you're in speed his left hand's dominant but you might find that your your", "start": 381.84, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "coordination improves the more you do it because john daly he hits a lot of lefty chips and pitches he does and he's not lefty yep", "start": 389.52, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "and so it can be pretty beneficial he's got some dang good hands too it can be good for yeah some chipping pitching too if you if you were to release it a little sooner", "start": 397.6, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "that can be good around the greens but the long swing that's that's challenging to really to kind of hold it off but it can be a good practice i suppose", "start": 406.4, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "for sure there you go let's uh bring in the frisbee of the golf course i guess yeah watch this let's go play thanks for watching we'll uh we'll see", "start": 414.8, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "you next time make sure you subscribe leave a comment below with what you guys think of our our disc golf game see ya", "start": 429.12, "duration": 15.921}
