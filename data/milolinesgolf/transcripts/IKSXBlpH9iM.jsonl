{"chunk": "one interesting thing to note if you saw that down the line this board wanted to spin out from under me the right foot wanted to go back that way it shows that i'm not just pushing", "start": 0.0, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "right and left i'm actually torquing the board pretty hard [Music]", "start": 9.2, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "okay henry so here today we have this is called the shaftic pressure board what it is it's a", "start": 18.16, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "board that's got a little so it's basically a piece of plywood with some carpet on it and under it it's got a little piece of one by", "start": 27.68, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "running down the middle so it can teeter like a teeter-totter it's actually a pretty cool tool for many of our students it's not something i've ever even thought of", "start": 36.719, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "using but i've you know i've had a few students lately who have a really difficult time feeling how to shift pressure", "start": 45.6, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "and even a little bit of mass at the right time they want to actually go all backward well that's okay so you just brought up mass right", "start": 54.32, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "um how many times have you heard man i just didn't get to my left side man i just didn't transfer my weight", "start": 62.16, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "and get i didn't post up on my lead leg how many times you heard those things put out there a lot okay and they", "start": 71.04, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "are kind of truths but not necessarily totally true because what a lot of people do is when they they think they're posting up on", "start": 78.799, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "their their front leg they're actually sliding and tilting it's not a beneficial thing for them where they'd be better off", "start": 87.28, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "more like this kind of a look turning and sitting rather than", "start": 98.64, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "bumping their pelvis so let's kind of walk through what a proper shift in turn looks like well i think it's important to say too", "start": 106.72, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "like this we're focusing on pressure shifts not weight shifts and that's what i kind of wanted to get to is that we're not talking about the center", "start": 114.399, "duration": 19.601000000000003}
{"chunk": "moving to and from that center line that we sort of started on that much right right ideally it moves a little", "start": 124.32, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "but it stabilizes and starts going back to the middle fairly quickly so let's let's kind of walk through i'll be the the demonstrator here", "start": 133.36, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "so as i'm set up ideally i would be pretty balanced on the board and then as i get ready to go i like to", "start": 142.4, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "feel a little bit of a shift of pressure to my front foot so i can move my front foot into the ground and move off the ball just slightly", "start": 150.4, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "early so i like to see left right now how much did my mass move a little", "start": 159.36, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "i think in in gears i move like an inch and a half or so that way which really didn't get all your mass over to your right leg", "start": 167.76, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "not all of it yeah so i move about an inch and a half to the right and what's interesting is my my pelvis so my hips and my chest both move about that inch", "start": 177.84, "duration": 17.360000000000003}
{"chunk": "and a half so it's pretty symmetric it's really your center that's what even your even your head might move just a little bit", "start": 187.12, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "too yeah everything kind of moves a little to the right and then about right here everything starts to wander back to the", "start": 194.64, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "front and you saw the board went the other way right there so in reality when the club is moving fast i probably don't get pressure back to the left that soon", "start": 202.48, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "but it's wandering that way now again that's pressure that's not yes that's not your whole weight one", "start": 211.599, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "it's a complicated subject because pressure is affected a lot by motion yeah so as i'm moving through space and as i'm", "start": 222.0, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "swinging this weighted stick around me it has a pretty big effect on where pressure's at all the time but in general what we want to see is we", "start": 229.84, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "want to see this side of the board go down about you know right there as we start to move the golf club", "start": 238.799, "duration": 15.920999999999998}
{"chunk": "and then we want to feel like we've maxed out the pressure under our trail foot by somewhere in this ballpark and then it's beginning to wander itself", "start": 246.72, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "back toward the front foot so we can plant that front foot before we start the club down but again my my mass isn't going", "start": 254.64, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "right left all that much yeah so let's let's take that one step further so i'm gonna put an alignment stick right", "start": 264.24, "duration": 19.279}
{"chunk": "hopefully in line with the camera and our board here perfect so it's right in the middle of your center okay okay", "start": 273.36, "duration": 19.278999999999996}
{"chunk": "so that's basically up through your sternum over through your head and down between your two feet okay okay so", "start": 283.199, "duration": 16.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "if you guys watch on camera will his center will his center move slightly off that line in the backswing well yes but it", "start": 291.44, "duration": 18.160000000000004}
{"chunk": "also went a little left to start didn't it yeah so it went just slightly left right left and then it's back in front of it", "start": 300.72, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "slightly and then if anything it starts to back up slightly up into the finish it actually begins to back itself my", "start": 308.72, "duration": 18.157999999999998}
{"chunk": "upper center so there's i like to look at the swing as two different centers i've got the upper center so my middle of my rib cage yeah and my lower center of my pelvis", "start": 317.919, "duration": 18.162}
{"chunk": "my pelvis keeps moving forward but about the time the shaft gets pedaled to the ground the upper center actually starts", "start": 326.56, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "to work back yeah and that's why you get that look with so many pros where their belt buckle their hips is actually to the closest to the", "start": 336.32, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "target compared to their upper body yeah exactly well hopefully not too far outside their foot we yeah we really don't want this left hip", "start": 344.56, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "outside of the ankle that's not good for you yeah so we want to ideally i like to feel like my upper and lower center stay stacked on top of each", "start": 353.44, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "other longer and more yeah but it to be able to sling this club and get the energy out i do have to have some", "start": 362.88, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "push up and back at some point so you're going to have your centers move off of each other late in the swing", "start": 372.16, "duration": 15.040999999999999}
{"chunk": "so in addition to this board that this is just in one direction right it's basically on this target line okay", "start": 379.44, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "or parallel to the target line so in addition to this your pressure is also moving sort of to the camera and away from the camera as well in the golf swing yeah so", "start": 388.08, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "maybe we should talk a little bit about that as well so hard to show on this board yeah it's hard because this board is just a left", "start": 397.44, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "and right teeter totter but in reality there would be a forward and backward teeter-totter and force moves in 3d so it moves forward backward", "start": 405.199, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "left right up and down yeah and it does it's doing all those things all at the same time okay so why don't we get this pointed to the target for a second", "start": 414.8, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "or down the range i should say okay so now we got it pointed down our intended target line i guess", "start": 423.84, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "so we're talking a little bit too about the pressure how it's not just moving back and away from where we're hitting the golf ball it's", "start": 432.8, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "also moving this way okay so let's talk a little bit about that and why that is well in order to get this hip to turn my", "start": 441.84, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "this foot is actually pushing that way so going in this way", "start": 450.4, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "yes what's it's probably going about like on this diagonal okay like that so it's pushing on that diagonal which", "start": 459.28, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "is basically a parallel vector to the clubs what the club's going to swing on and it's going to create rotation so this foot", "start": 467.44, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "pushes this one catches me and pushes that way which makes this hip turn out of the way and it starts to send my body", "start": 475.84, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah kind of up and back this way to a point and then i fall land on this foot now you're moving this way a little bit so now i'm moving this way because", "start": 485.039, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "that push that way made me kind of fall away and back toward the target now this foot lands and it pushes", "start": 494.879, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "kind of like that way i would say right yeah something like that up and back in here yep you know a lot of people think you just fall right into the heel and turn", "start": 504.16, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "your foot open well first it really lands a little more in the middle of our foot towards the outside of the foot for me i actually see it land more in", "start": 511.68, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "the ball of the foot yeah and then work itself to the outside and then around to the heel yeah so i have a spiral yeah it's a spiraling action", "start": 519.76, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "and this foot is pushing away from where the club's going the club's going that way the foot's pushing away from it", "start": 528.88, "duration": 15.119000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah so if you're thinking of moving to the target with your club this is actually slowing you down but by", "start": 538.399, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "actually landing and then pushing back that launches that slings the clubs out yeah it makes the club go faster yeah that's basically", "start": 546.08, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "what's happening under my feet it's really hard to feel it all standing on this board yeah i'm better i feel it more on the ground this is very", "start": 555.04, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "good for training the left and rights of the golf swing yeah how to time left right left but more that's going on i think that's", "start": 562.64, "duration": 18.878}
{"chunk": "why we wanted to bring up the other forces right yeah there's the other traces that are going on with our", "start": 571.839, "duration": 15.282}
{"chunk": "pressure there's a lot more going on and to understand too that the golf swing is a side on sport it's on a plane yeah", "start": 579.6, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "the club is swinging so if you are just moving side to side well that doesn't really", "start": 588.8, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "doesn't really swing the club the way we want no if all i did is move side side that's not going to make the club accelerate around it's not going to kick", "start": 596.72, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "the energy out yeah so it's a 3d motion it's not just lateral motion it's got", "start": 605.92, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "some up and some backing away so that board is pretty cool though it can give you at least an understanding", "start": 614.48, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "as well of the sequence of the motion i think that's one thing that's what i really like it for yeah why don't we turn it back and talk about that real quick", "start": 623.04, "duration": 15.681000000000003}
{"chunk": "what i really like the board for is just to help people feel the the sequence and the timing of when the shifts of pressure happen", "start": 631.12, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "not so much all the different directions that happens but that win so in order for me to get this club moving i've got to feel like i shift to the", "start": 639.76, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "right and then if i shift to the right and i stay to the right it's really hard to swing down and shift back to the left so if i", "start": 647.6, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "can go right left swing now all of a sudden it's timed up right and i can swing the club fast and at", "start": 656.88, "duration": 17.678}
{"chunk": "first when you if you set start at the beginning again at first i want you guys to notice when milo does this in real time he actually", "start": 665.519, "duration": 15.602}
{"chunk": "starts that way a little bit first yeah so i would have the board basically balanced if i could get it just to balance it's hard won't quite balance but i would go", "start": 673.44, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "left right yeah to get myself going it's a pretty severe little incline right there well it falls off an edge yeah", "start": 683.2, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "so it's hard to get like if i get 51 percent of pressure on my front foot it falls down yeah where in reality i probably am like 55", "start": 691.6, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "left on an iron shot and on a driver maybe a little less yeah but then i go 100 left i basically unweight my right foot so i", "start": 699.839, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "can rock into it hard yeah what would be interesting too is to see say we took all the pga tour players current right now and say okay i want", "start": 707.839, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "you to get on this board and hit a golf ball some players might be a little bit more towards this side some players might be a little more towards that side you know", "start": 717.279, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "be interesting to see because i'm definitely more like we've talked about a little more left poster and my first trigger move i don't really quite move my mask quite as much as you", "start": 726.639, "duration": 19.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "do mine's a little bit more of just a counter swivel or counter rotation and go but i also would probably be on this side a little bit more throughout the", "start": 735.44, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "swing yeah but you'd still slam that side down with your rotation for sure for sure my mass might just be", "start": 744.24, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "your math stays more on the front but you can you can keep your mass forward and slam that down again", "start": 752.24, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "important to note is that we're we're staying relatively towards the middle of that board yep", "start": 760.0, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "okay milo so we gotta hit one now okay let me turn it around and hit it this could be complicated", "start": 767.92, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "we shall find out pretty good i flushed it one interesting thing to note if you saw", "start": 775.12, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "that down the line this board wanted to spin out from under me the right foot wanted to go back that way it shows that i'm not just pushing", "start": 803.76, "duration": 15.118}
{"chunk": "right and left i'm actually torquing the board pretty hard so let's try it one more time oh see it wanted to really slide that", "start": 811.279, "duration": 16.722}
{"chunk": "time can't hit it that hard [Music] you", "start": 823.76, "duration": 13.49}
