{"chunk": "thing is you have to decide do you want to fly it over there and throw some spin on it or do you want to slide it in a little lower let it bounce once or twice and check yeah that's", "start": 21.6, "duration": 17.580000000000002}
{"chunk": "dependent on the greens and where the pins at right so you're out on a golf course if you have a front pin more times than not you need to go for the one that kind of flies and Spins yeah it", "start": 30.24, "duration": 17.04}

{"chunk": "looking for power speed right so when I think about this it's essentially just a big Chip Shot for Me especially when I'm going down and Loft to a sand wedge then it really just feels like a big pit shot", "start": 123.72, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "driven by my Pivot and the only difference between that and the full swing is I'm just not adding any hinge in the motion because I don't need it so with this is this a sandwich Yep this is", "start": 132.599, "duration": 15.421}
