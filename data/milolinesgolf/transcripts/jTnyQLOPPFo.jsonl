{"chunk": "so it's basically like you're taking a step in any other sport only here for most players you know we don't see the feet up off the ground too much", "start": 0.48, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "yeah i don't mind it but that for most players you're not we're not going to see that but what we do want to see is we want to see the knee yeah hop in here mod cause i want them to see", "start": 8.08, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "that from facebook so what we what we want to see is we want to see the the left knee working out and around this way yep", "start": 16.24, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "and so when you can you go up to the top of your swing there one more time to half one so what i would be looking at here is a line kind of on the femur or the leg and if i were to draw a line on that that's pretty much straight up and down", "start": 26.64, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "and if you do your transition motion what happens is that line on the leg now is out some amount right go back up top so let's say this is at 12-ish and then", "start": 35.12, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "do that again you know that knee might have went out to like between one and two o'clock right so that's that external rotation feel kneecap more", "start": 43.44, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "towards the target sensor and it really only goes external about to halfway down yeah kind of the same as like the reflex kind of the reason it's matching with the reflexing so", "start": 50.96, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "those two things are happening [Music] simultaneously", "start": 59.76, "duration": 17.917}
{"chunk": "[Music] all right guys so we're back here with mr milo from golf lettuce thank you for", "start": 72.08, "duration": 16.529}
{"chunk": "having us here appreciate ya welcome back gold canyon arizona superstition mountain golf club yeah as you guys can see in the background actually beautiful stunning setting", "start": 85.52, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "so we really do appreciate you having us after this it's awesome and in today's video we're going to talk about how to start the downswing lower body in particular and i think", "start": 94.0, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "there's really two key movements that we're going to talk about to highlight but before we dive into those milo let's go ahead and look at analyzer and just check out a couple good players", "start": 102.159, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "so you can see what we're going to talk about here before we dive in okay so let's take a look here at how good players start the down swing i just have jordan spieth here at", "start": 109.92, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "the top and let's take a look at both of the legs specifically the flex in the legs now part one of what we're going to talk about here", "start": 119.04, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "is both legs increasing flex to start down so here he is roughly at the top of the swing and watch the knees in transition right and", "start": 126.88, "duration": 15.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "clearly both of those let me get those lines out of there clearly both legs the lead leg left one and the right one from here watch the knees both", "start": 135.04, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "legs increasing flex or increasing bend as he's getting lower to the ground that would be part number one we're looking at both legs increasing the amount of bend", "start": 142.8, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "from the top sample here got a justin thomas with the driver and let's get him to the top now what you're going to see with the lead leg", "start": 153.28, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "i'll just draw a line down here roughly at the top that lead leg is more or less straight up and down maybe slightly in and watch the movement of the leg in", "start": 161.599, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "transition so by the time it gets to left arm parallel it goes from pretty much straight up and down at 12 o'clock and outward knee towards the target external rotation", "start": 170.48, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "from the top so let's watch that one more time as the legs are flexing the lead leg is also working around that's a simultaneous motion that's", "start": 179.44, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "happening really from the top to lead arm parallel so both knees increasing flex and that lead leg working around", "start": 188.4, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "kneecap towards the target is how you want to start the downswing with the lower body okay guys so obviously you saw the two key movements there what would you say the", "start": 196.159, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "purpose right why if i'm in here like this do i want to do any kind of reflexing from the top of the backswing", "start": 205.36, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "well there's quite a few purposes but in order for you to be able to continue to turn if you can get yourself back square and", "start": 213.04, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "have flex in your knees you can continue onward if you've lost all the flex in your knees early in transition you're done", "start": 220.959, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "yeah you're just left with hands that's right yeah exactly revving too long so the the general idea here about hey how do i start my downswing", "start": 229.44, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "i'm gonna feel my legs reflexing really for the purpose of being able to pivot yes being able to rotate create speed etc etc", "start": 237.28, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "and we want to start with that from the top right if i get myself into a position from the top of the backswing obviously in my setup right milo my knees are both bent", "start": 246.0, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "yes right roughly over the balls of my feet let's say as a stock mark when i make my back swing my trail leg is going to lose some flex", "start": 254.0, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "yeah definitely lose a little flex and your lead leg gains a little bit of flex on the way back yep and then as i start down initially", "start": 262.0, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "both legs right compared to where i am at the top yes are going to reflex or bend more exactly and i'm going to do that probably let's", "start": 269.28, "duration": 17.998}
{"chunk": "say this reflexing motion bend my legs more kind of roughly until about left arm parallel yeah right that's about right yeah just", "start": 278.479, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "kind of the initial phase of the downswing and the kneecaps maybe get re-bent back over the balls of the feet as a simple stock mark right yeah what i'm looking", "start": 286.479, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "to avoid here from the top is a uh no reflexing of the legs arms and hands straight down what i'm looking to avoid from the top is no", "start": 295.12, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "reflexing straight up into a straightening motion yes right so reflexing the legs as i begin down let's say i understand that i", "start": 303.759, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "saw the video i saw this video i buy into it i want to reflex my legs and pivot and rotate like you do in your swing how does someone start with that well", "start": 311.199, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "like i do anything slow yeah so first you you take it up to the top and you you make some rehearsal swings", "start": 320.32, "duration": 19.358}
{"chunk": "where you actually just do that so you practice feeling yourself i call it unwaiting in transition so", "start": 329.039, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "you're basically it's like you're getting ready to jump and you're doing it in your transition would you say i'm", "start": 337.84, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "in a general sense that i'm trying to start my downswing with the reflexing and letting my arms and hands kind of come for the ride if you will", "start": 345.84, "duration": 17.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "generally i would say yes yeah generally you don't need to really feel like you're doing a whole lot you're not applying a lot of force to the golf club early in transition with", "start": 354.639, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "your hands right right it's there's some certain examples et cetera et cetera but we're saying here is when i'm starting down i'm really key", "start": 363.36, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "in on the legs reflecting yes my arms and hands right now are coming down towards the ground and i'm not feeling them at all yeah right so not consciously yeah for most players it's going to feel like", "start": 370.24, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "they're not doing anything as long as the structure was built correctly at the top yeah and so when i'm doing this i'm going slow right i like what you said before of", "start": 378.96, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "having a lot of players feeling full swings but doing it slower right and so when i'm doing this am i going kind of half swing length", "start": 386.72, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "should i start big and go slow i actually like full swing length so you get used to the feeling of how things are going to move in reality sure just doing it really slow gotcha so", "start": 395.199, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "you're this is hard to do yeah i rarely find somebody that can pull it off right away yeah but you're making full swings you've got a nine iron in your hand and", "start": 404.479, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "you're hitting that nine iron 75 yards okay with the full swing so that white flag got there like a hundred ish yeah it's probably around 100 so i'm going short of the white flag", "start": 412.24, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "with a pretty long swing feeling the reflexing yep in transition okay let's go ahead and give it a shot so if i go 150 here i'm going to give myself credit", "start": 421.039, "duration": 18.002}
{"chunk": "so reflexing from the top and so for those that can't see how far that went they went about 130 yards okay so close right close fish 75 130.", "start": 429.12, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "and when i'm practicing this because it's hard for me to know if i did it right if we're not standing here right yeah so you need some feedback you", "start": 441.52, "duration": 16.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "need some video yeah you're actually looking to see yourself compressing into the ground it should be visible good go what i really need to", "start": 451.28, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "do to feel that is get a couple good rehearsals maybe see one or two feel that i'm actually doing it right yeah", "start": 459.36, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "see that i'm actually doing it and and allow myself to exaggerate to the point where i actually get a big enough lowering yeah", "start": 467.36, "duration": 15.680000000000001}
{"chunk": "for for many of you it's going to feel like there's no way it could be right you're lowering so far yeah and then you'll see oh i went down like an inch", "start": 474.639, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "yeah it feels like three feet and it went down an inch or so exactly so the reflexing the legs right you'll see there obviously guys the players do it right that's what's generating the", "start": 483.039, "duration": 15.681}
{"chunk": "ability to rotate and pivot power but that's not the only thing that's involved with the rotation there's a little bit we want to talk about with the lead leg let's dive into that next", "start": 491.199, "duration": 19.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "okay milo so part number two here has to do with how the lead leg works so let's talk a little bit about that how do i start the down swing", "start": 500.08, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "talk about the reflexing what does the lead leg do so it's basically like you're taking a step in any other sport only here for most players you know we", "start": 509.599, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "don't see the feet up off the ground too much yeah i don't mind it but that for most players you're not we're not going to see that but what we do want to see is we want to", "start": 518.479, "duration": 15.682}
{"chunk": "see the knee yeah hop in here mouth because i want them to see that from facebook so what we what we want to see is we want to see the", "start": 526.08, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "the left knee working out and around this way yep and so when you can you go up to the top of your swing there one more time to have one", "start": 533.12, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "so what i would be looking at here is a line kind of on the femur or the leg and if i were to draw a line on that that's pretty much straight up and down and if you do your transition motion", "start": 541.68, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "what happens is that line on the leg now is out some amount right go back up top so let's say this is at 12 ish and then do that again you know that knee might have went out", "start": 549.44, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "to like between one and two o'clock right so that's that external rotation feel kneecap more towards the target sensor and it really only goes external", "start": 557.76, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "about to halfway down yeah kind of the same as like the reflex kind of the re so it's matching with the reflexing so those two things are happening simultaneously exactly so at the same time let me just", "start": 566.48, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "flip off spots one more time at the same time as i'm doing my reflexing motion up from the top like this and i'm doing my lowering and i'm not making a full", "start": 575.68, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "swing but my lead leg is actually going out i'm going from that let's say kneecap on the way back is let's just call it at", "start": 584.32, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "towards the ballish even though it's really already at one and my leg is straight up and down that leg's working around to that two o'clock spot my kneecap is getting closer to the", "start": 592.32, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "target as i'm reflexing both of my legs now as i'm doing that my right leg kind of in simple sense kind of staying where it is yeah it's really you're not", "start": 601.519, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "driving off your right leg yet so your right leg is basically staying kind of where it's just staying where it's at yeah i mean we know there's some actual other things going on here", "start": 610.8, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "that right leg is staying where it's at so as i start the downswing lower body motion reflexing the legs lead leg and kneecap", "start": 619.6, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "works around as i go let me just hit one or two with that feel feeling here milo okay so knees are going down lead leg is", "start": 627.68, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "working around yeah that felt really good for me that was pretty good and you know again there's a lot of different feels i know we talked", "start": 635.2, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
{"chunk": "a little bit off camera there as we're doing drills but really what we're looking for milo and to your point are feels here right", "start": 646.16, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "and there could be a million different feels how to do that what i'm feeling is definitely my left leg in particular is bending more than normal i feel my", "start": 653.839, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "kneecap working past my foot towards the target right that's kind of the sensation that i'm getting as i'm doing this reflexing an external", "start": 661.68, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "rotation and there might be 10 different ways to to feel that yeah right for sure so leg's reflexing", "start": 670.88, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "lead leg going external yeah that one also felt good that was pretty pure so those would be the two pieces now one little caveat i would say we would add", "start": 678.64, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "to this because we're kind of oversimplifying with two pieces there's more stuff but one piece that i think is", "start": 691.36, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "pretty important with this is the tilting or the angles of the pelvis yeah exactly so can i jump in yeah please do so", "start": 698.72, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "in the backswing because of the way our legs have moved so i'm losing a little bit of the flex in my right leg and gaining a little bit", "start": 708.64, "duration": 15.681}
{"chunk": "more flex in my left leg as i turn here to the top that's put my pelvis on an incline so it's tilted down now in transition", "start": 716.8, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "one thing i want to make sure i don't do is i don't want this to tilt up immediately so i want to feel like as i start down that that stays", "start": 725.68, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "low yeah and i want to make a point because i can hop stiff you can stay in there one sec please if you go up to the top of your swing again because i think we know that's why i'm sure everyone", "start": 733.12, "duration": 15.039000000000001}
{"chunk": "gathers this can you make the left side of the hip go up right away again so what happened when he did that right is that leg", "start": 740.959, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "didn't increase flex in transition that leg went from a bent condition into a straighter position when that lead leg goes straighter that hip has nowhere to go but", "start": 748.16, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "up so part of it and i know you know this part of this do that again please as he does the do the good version the good version as he does this that reflexing", "start": 757.6, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "and external of that leg puts him in a position to keep that lead side lower as that leg reflexes right i think that's an important thing and it keeps the this left side of my hip inside of my", "start": 766.399, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "foot so it's not it's not moving very much laterally when i do that bingo so let's uh i'd love to have you hit balls all day but i'm going to hop in here one more time", "start": 776.32, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "okay and with the those two pieces together right kind of wrapping this up up to the top we're saying reflexing the legs i said 100 times", "start": 783.76, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "the lead leg goes external the knee out as a byproduct of that and as a byproduct of the backswing reflexing the legs", "start": 791.6, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "that lead side of the hip should stay lower in early transition kind of roughly to the same point yeah right and all this stuff is really happening", "start": 799.76, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "from the top of the swing to about left arm parallel or halfway down yes and it's all happening together right now by no means do you need to think", "start": 808.48, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "let me reflex my legs let me get my left leg external let me keep my left side of pelvis lower all three of them you might have one feel you might have", "start": 817.2, "duration": 15.999999999999998}
{"chunk": "one little piece within that or you might have all three right whatever whatever gets the pivot and rotation that we want to have there is fine", "start": 826.0, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "that's what's happening as a stock general video because we can't see every single person swing we're saying that would give you the best chance to reach potential create the best", "start": 833.12, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "pivot have the best rotation lead to club face control right the whole night if you look at 99 percent of the best players i know", "start": 842.0, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "they all do that yeah i like that short and sweet and to the point i get to learn more about that milo thanks man appreciate you thank you thanks", "start": 850.959, "duration": 17.002}
