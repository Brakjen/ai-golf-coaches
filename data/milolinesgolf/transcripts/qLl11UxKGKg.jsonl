{"chunk": "that's pretty good check it out no that feel that's feeling like I'm getting the turn there oh yeah it's way better yeah oh yeah wow so now you", "start": 4.88, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "change directions here that is see how much better that is and I actually even see myself falling down to the left I never see you can", "start": 13.96, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "fall down and left in transition right there that is Light Years different than our first swing light crazy though how", "start": 23.08, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "much that affects my ability to fall down into the ball cuz here I'm already going up on the left side the second I start coming down well you yeah there's", "start": 31.439, "duration": 18.521}
{"chunk": "no left hip dip you can't you can't drop you can't have the the nice transition down because you didn't wind up mhm cuz that yeah no I mean it makes sense", "start": 40.6, "duration": 19.198}
{"chunk": "that's Pretty stinking good now the only thing I would love to see here is a little bit that left leg kind of stiffen up a little bit more now but I don't", "start": 50.399, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "want to add anything too that's something that we can do later I we just have to fix what we got right now I think I think hammering this like", "start": 58.879, "duration": 15.602}
{"chunk": "that like I I haven't been in a position to be able to straighten it I think because of that lack of turn and lack of load yeah when you're just been trying", "start": 66.0, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "to get out of the way when your max turn is here you're just trying to figure out how to get to the ball exactly", "start": 75.32, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "much better no it feels so much better I mean just the patience is the key yeah we've shallowed you out a a ton since the first lesson oh yeah I mean if I'm", "start": 98.2, "duration": 18.62}
{"chunk": "not goat humping [Music] and there you go it's a push draw yeah that was money too", "start": 108.119, "duration": 17.661}
{"chunk": "upright your clubs just need to be flattened out some think basically standard and you'll hit the face more so in order for you to make the The Loft", "start": 116.64, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "point at your target you've got to get so can I B that I'm borrow both so when that loft is pointing straight that's how high the handle is right here that's", "start": 124.52, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "how high your handle has to be right that's a lot it's a ton and if I'm actually getting it in the slot I don't need that extra and if we if we come in", "start": 133.56, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "and we have the handle just a little lower like you are now cuz now we're winding falling and unwinding like this that loft is pointed left and it", "start": 143.68, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "actually makes sense though if I'm that I'm hitting that if I'm getting my hands that I'm getting more heel contact and", "start": 152.319, "duration": 15.801}
{"chunk": "kind of hitting those skanky ones that are the a little bit I think the LI angle is a big chunk of the meth the the problem we have and it probably also", "start": 159.92, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "makes sense why I'm not having this issue with my Woods mm huh okay I'll bend them back that's easy yeah it's easy simple fix golf swing wise I just", "start": 168.68, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "want you to keep working on lengthening it out patience in transition so you're just wind wind wind wind wind now you can fall down and", "start": 177.68, "duration": 17.558}
{"chunk": "unwind it and just let it happen and it'll probably go a little left cuz this club doesn't fit right just like that that one felt", "start": 188.48, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "good so that's the other one you're going to be more apt to get cuz if it's upright that heel will dig y chunk which is exactly what is good so you can make", "start": 202.2, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "if you make what feels like a great motion you got you know the handle is coming in a little lower cuz you're a little more like this", "start": 210.439, "duration": 20.042}
{"chunk": "like yep chunk pretty good though that's a really good golf swing right there and that Ball's 12 yards left of where you wanted it", "start": 219.04, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "yeah same swing with this one would have been perfect On Target I mean I think that might be what we're talking about it actually makes a lot of sense too just with this swing change actually", "start": 245.4, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "ingraining over the past 6 months getting me shallower it would make sense that I've been actually probably swinging better than I think and not", "start": 254.68, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "hitting it as well partially due to the clubs not being fit right he's fixed hey so you have your swing", "start": 264.0, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "field and I'll give you my clubs we're done we're good even that one could have went more it's a little tilty yeah so now", "start": 283.36, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "that's the next piece of the puzzle I want to make sure we we don't", "start": 294.039, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "go this way mhm so swing it up big big turn now I want you to feel like this comes down and on top like that okay not", "start": 300.84, "duration": 18.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "not yeah do you feel the difference oh yeah oh yeah so it's this way not this way yeah doesn't have to be that down", "start": 312.039, "duration": 17.482}
{"chunk": "just a little down there you go there see how your legs stiffened up yep that's the feel cuz I'm I'm I mean this is the remnants", "start": 323.199, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "of me trying to figure out how to shallow it I know you shallowed it with your slide I want you to shallow it with your rib cage and your", "start": 332.4, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "arms there you go and see how it's not nearly your your down is like so exaggerated it doesn't have to be that crazy just there you go now it's around", "start": 340.96, "duration": 17.161}
{"chunk": "now you just go boom perfect that's it right there can you hit one for me at that pace just", "start": 349.96, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "feeling those exaggerations yeah sucked huh terrible that's and it feels easier yeah there's", "start": 356.6, "duration": 17.879}
{"chunk": "Le there's a lot less work just coming to here than going like this yeah to way easier and the ball doesn't go left that's an added", "start": 370.88, "duration": 17.518}
{"chunk": "bonus yeah that was much better there wasn't nearly so tilty so finish that wind that's what it was right and then I", "start": 380.759, "duration": 20.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "want left side on top there you go now then you can go out of the way notice the the ball flights more", "start": 397.72, "duration": 19.918000000000003}
{"chunk": "that way and it feels it it feels the the fu Milo is so much better better um I mean it is it feels I feel more on top", "start": 414.68, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "of it but I feel just like I hate this move yeah me too like it feels just I want to Bob it when I well look how much different it is so you didn't you didn't", "start": 423.4, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "quite finish this turn here but see how you're oh yeah you're stacked up so much better and it's going to save my back", "start": 433.039, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "yes it will where when you did this one so that stuck feel that I get a lot when I hit the big block out to the right is that I'm here there's nowhere else to", "start": 440.919, "duration": 17.523000000000003}
{"chunk": "rotate I'm here exactly but if I can get I mean it feels like it's just a couple inches but it's when it up to the top again what you're doing is you're just", "start": 456.28, "duration": 15.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "taking your rib cage just a little bit that way right down and on top and then you just unwind yeah and now your left leg", "start": 464.759, "duration": 16.599000000000004}
{"chunk": "straightens it seems so simple when you explain it to me like this yet I struggle to f fig it out I mean I guess that's why you're a coach and know what", "start": 474.24, "duration": 18.44}
{"chunk": "you're doing I try I'm a good guesser yep that was I think that was all of it put together arms straight all", "start": 482.0, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "the way to just sort of parallel and I should be 90\u00b0 by that point and then I can let it finish but I", "start": 497.52, "duration": 15.639}
{"chunk": "have to let it finish yep let it finish and then it's just a reentering by like 3 in and down an inch yep and then I can", "start": 505.319, "duration": 18.159999999999997}
