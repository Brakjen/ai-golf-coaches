{"chunk": "we wanted to cover a video on training it's something that we both use quite a bit in lessons and for ourselves so most of you have watched my videos", "start": 0.16, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "know that i don't use a ton of training training aids but the ones i use i tend to use quite often because i like them [Music]", "start": 10.32, "duration": 17.419}
{"chunk": "i think most training aids are kind of gimmicky and don't do that much but there are a few really good ones and here we brought out some of the ones that i actually like and i believe in", "start": 21.84, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "um and that i use in in my lessons and that i think that you should all have awesome well let's start with the hanger you got that one in your hands", "start": 30.24, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "sweet so the the hanger it can be this hanger the hanger or a hanger it doesn't matter which one if you understand how to attach it now", "start": 38.399, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "the key is the way that the hanger is designed is it has a face on it they want you to set it up with the face matching your club face", "start": 46.48, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "i don't want you to do that i like the hanger set up so that when i grip it the hanger rests on my right arm", "start": 55.36, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "and then if my wrists work how i like wrist to work when i hinge my my trail wrist in into", "start": 63.6, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "extension the hanger moves from my right wrist or my right forearm to my left forearm and then if i swing that down i can maintain that", "start": 71.119, "duration": 20.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "connection all the way down so for me it's really good to train you how to use your wrists and it gives you some feedback immediate", "start": 81.28, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "so if i flip at it i can feel that go to the right wrist the right forearm so for me this is an awesome training", "start": 90.32, "duration": 15.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "aid it's one that i use a lot and you've seen some players even phil mickelson i remember using either that one or something similar um can you hit one just in slow motion", "start": 98.079, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "for us and yeah and when you do these drills and use training aids tee it up if you can at least starting out um it's always kind of recommended that", "start": 107.36, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "when you're moving slow just yeah you get easy on yourself right anytime i'm doing something that's different than my normal yeah it's on a tee in most of my", "start": 117.36, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "practice sessions it's on a tee just because i don't like to chew up grass so okay so i'm just gonna slow motion", "start": 125.28, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "get a golf ball with it i bottle that one up that was pretty nice", "start": 132.48, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "yeah not bad huh okay so now we go to the next one here here we've got another training aid henry's got in his hand and he brought this one back from", "start": 151.36, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "their trip over to the british open it's a really good training aid it's what's this one called the trs yep tour rotation stick so the tour", "start": 159.519, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "rotation stick is basically kind of like putting an alignment stick in your hands only you don't have to hold it in your hands right yeah and it doesn't hurt as bad when it hits you yeah it's not going to rattle around as much so you just", "start": 169.68, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "kind of pin it to the top here and when you set it up i would use it like a sand wedge or pitching wedge anything above that just becomes a little", "start": 178.8, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "problematic i found but definitely meant for sort of chips pitches three-quarter shots sort of thing and what's it helping you with", "start": 187.92, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "yeah so when you set up here it goes outside your left hip socket and as you come back into impact right ideally that shaft's leaning you're", "start": 196.8, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "starting to rotate out of the way if you get flippy uh oh you get whacked so it gives you some feedback right away you know that you you unloaded your wrists too soon", "start": 205.84, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "right so two things you really like are rotation and this right wrist angle right for sure so this guy covers both if you think about it", "start": 215.36, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "because you got to keep this right wrist angle yep and then you gotta clear and rotate out of the way perfect definitely one of the training aids that i use with my students", "start": 223.12, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "yep so and ideally if you do want let me just chip one here you can see how that goes back around me", "start": 231.28, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "and the face stays pretty", "start": 239.28, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "square on there awesome", "start": 241.12, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "so that's that's an awesome aid okay now on the ground here we've got a few more i want to start with the ball because this is one that students who", "start": 254.319, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "have come out and taken lessons with me you know if you've got some bad structure problems a lot of times the ball is one of the things i", "start": 262.079, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "i'll make you do yep so how does this work henry yeah so you're going to put it depending on your arm structure and the size of your body and all that", "start": 269.44, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "that stuff for me i'd probably put it right between my elbows i had something smaller it could move its way down a little bit yep so right in here face the camera and", "start": 278.8, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "show yep so one thing you like a lot too is the pivot right yeah so this keeps everything kind of connected so that's where i start with", "start": 287.52, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "it i start with kind of a little turn turn drill that's in a lot of my videos that's step number one so i love people to learn how to turn", "start": 296.08, "duration": 15.999999999999998}
{"chunk": "with arm structure okay and then once we can do that step number two is we start adding in some levers yeah what do we want our elbows to", "start": 303.44, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "separate when we do that no we're kind of keeping everything sort together yeah so you can add in some wrist hinge and a little fold in your elbow without letting that", "start": 313.039, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "right arm get too far away so that's a really good training aid it's one that i use a lot perfect that's a good one you can do it", "start": 321.28, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "at home you don't have to hit balls with that you don't even need to hit balls you just train yourself yeah okay now we've got some other funny looking things down here", "start": 329.68, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "most of us have something like this at home this is an elastic band or stretch tubing you can do the same thing what do we do with this", "start": 338.4, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "yeah so there's a couple exercises i really like if you actually if you don't mind holding this for me if you pin it to a wall or something around a post", "start": 347.039, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "doing some sort of external rotation with the shoulder yep right because that's a move that you'd ideally", "start": 354.96, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "like in the downswing instead of the opposite right and then the other one for me let's flip around real quick", "start": 363.36, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "is if you have it pinned this way and do basically a golf swing with just your trail arm like if you were skipping a rock right", "start": 372.639, "duration": 16.562}
{"chunk": "so my arm would go this way when i do this so i'm not pulling with my arm i'm simply rotating so you're pushing", "start": 381.52, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "your left hip around the corner exactly so this is a really nice feel i'll do at the end of a workout or you know at home again some of these you", "start": 388.88, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "can do away from the golf course awesome so the last one this is pretty cool this was designed", "start": 397.52, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "by physical therapist um i think he's out of south korea and it's called the rotator and it has numerous applications a lot", "start": 406.0, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "of it is more like let's say a rotator cuff surgery or it was originally designed for rehab of rotator cuffs yeah so you", "start": 416.319, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "can gain mobility back into your rotator cuff right right but it's also got some really good uses for rotation and learning how to get your body to turn yeah and the one that you'll see", "start": 423.599, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "the exercise you'll see the most is kind of put your left hand on here put your right elbow in the padding here", "start": 432.96, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "and then grip this and then you sort of make this golf swing and you see what it does with the elbow getting back in front of you and the", "start": 440.0, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "wrist and the wrist so it gets it gives you the the conditions that i like to see in a golf swing right so very cool", "start": 449.199, "duration": 16.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "a lot of applications there's a bunch of like rotational stuff you can do with it open up things out they have cool very good videos on what", "start": 456.56, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "all you can do with it but for me the main application i use is the one you did there learning how to pivot and maintain this trail risk condition yeah so these are some great training aids", "start": 465.44, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "you can use you know whether you're practicing or again at home when you're really trying to kind of build up some sensations for what you're trying to", "start": 474.4, "duration": 22.241}
{"chunk": "you know accomplish awesome", "start": 482.56, "duration": 7.12}
