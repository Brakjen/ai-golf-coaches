{"chunk": "don't actually swing out to the right what makes my hands move up and left well that's the pivot so as I come down", "start": 294.09, "duration": 17.990000000000002}
{"chunk": "as my left leg starts to push back and away it pulls my left shoulder up and back which in turn pulls my left arm up", "start": 304.49, "duration": 22.270000000000003}
