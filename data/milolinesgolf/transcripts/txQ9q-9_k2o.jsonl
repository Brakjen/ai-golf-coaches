{"chunk": "to many of you are turning the shoulders you're trying to make this nice turn but you're actually hurting your your golf", "start": 7.799, "duration": 15.482000000000001}
{"chunk": "swing it's detrimental your golf swing and the way you're winding up when we're turning like so we're getting too flat", "start": 16.68, "duration": 15.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "which you off in here right yeah so what I noticed when you just did that your shoulders were turning on a really flat incline mhm and because of it your hips", "start": 23.76, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "actually basically wound up to Infinity they just went almost the same amount as your shoulders right show them what we're talking about if you turn a little too flat so this is where your", "start": 33.12, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "relationship with the golf ball is pretty much lost and we'll see it even the head turn off the ball we see this", "start": 42.84, "duration": 15.039000000000001}
{"chunk": "left shoulder rise we call this lead side expanding okay we want the trail side", "start": 50.239, "duration": 15.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "expanding basically the opp opposite we want to flip-flop those we call them bins yeah we want to flip the bins we want to actually", "start": 58.239, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "create a trail side expansion lead side Bend which gets our shoulders aiming on a steeper incline but it also creates a", "start": 66.4, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "bunch of good stuff it creates a differential between our hips and our chest we want our shoulder turn or our hip our our chest rotation to turn a lot", "start": 76.36, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "more than our hips so you can see here my hips have turned like maybe 45 yeah but my chest has turned like 90 we're", "start": 85.52, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "we're after more of that and we don't see that happen when we see people turn like this we see the belt actually get pointed back at you guys at the camera", "start": 93.24, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "so do that again so sometimes I'll see with students they they'll get this belt buckle pointed way back at the camera which gives the perception of a big wind", "start": 100.52, "duration": 20.239}
{"chunk": "up a good turn but you better believe you're going to be way off the ball so if you show them face on they can see that too you're going to be probably way", "start": 109.719, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "way off the ball you're going to be expanded in this lead side left shoulder high so you got a lot of making up to do to get back down to the ball and have", "start": 119.84, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "that relationship with the ball well and you didn't create any load in your muscles if I get wound up like this", "start": 129.399, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "there's not enough time in my downswing to do all the things I want to do we all we want to get our hips back around you", "start": 136.879, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "know some 45\u00b0 but if they turned 70 in the back swing yeah that's way too many degrees of rotation in the down swing there's no way I have time for all that", "start": 146.2, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "well this is why you see people that tend to get pretty flat in their back swing they tend to then make up for it", "start": 155.879, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "by going over the top in transition and in the down swing you don't see a lot of guys actually go in and then sort of stay in it kind of goes in and then back", "start": 162.76, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "out and over there's a big reason for that is the visual so when I make this when I make this turn like", "start": 172.04, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "this I can't see the ball here I can't see it yeah so what's my next move well I got there we go I see it now so I've got", "start": 178.519, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "to crank on it that direction to create a visual yeah so for those of you that might be thinking a back swing doesn't", "start": 188.2, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "matter kind of does because it kind of sets the stage we want to at least be winding up in the correct sort of tilt so then we can just drop in and sort of", "start": 196.36, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "turn on that same incline through the shot if we set the stage in the back swing where we get all flat and off it's just going to make it more complicated", "start": 206.2, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "to get back where we need to so this is actually perfect cuz you wore a striped shirt today I don't know if you were planning this or just was coincidence", "start": 215.36, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "but if you go ahead and set up we got the stripes on your shirt you can sort of see where things start to get angled towards if we make a proper back swing", "start": 223.36, "duration": 15.479999999999999}
{"chunk": "so shall I make a proper one yeah make a proper one for us so now you can see the stripes on his shirt are more on this", "start": 231.12, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "incline and we actually have a red Dow down here outside the mat and your shoulder incline should be relatively", "start": 238.68, "duration": 15.4}
{"chunk": "down towards that stick relatively close to that stick it's not going to be at the ball and it's not going to be out there on the horizon yeah you know it's going to probably for most players be", "start": 247.0, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "somewhere between this stick and about right there and we see a lot where it's like in your pool I see a lot of them in the", "start": 256.079, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "pool yeah totally so I see a lot like this yeah that's not even in the pool that's at the fence over there yeah so one thing we should probably preface", "start": 270.72, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "this with if you go up to the top is that we're not necessarily just talking about your lead arm you're going to see your lead arm is actually on a much more", "start": 279.4, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "vertical plane pointed probably almost ball or just outside the ball right right now people's lead arm playe might be there's", "start": 289.16, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "going to be some variations there and there some subtle variations too with your your shoulder tilt but we're looking just specifically at that that", "start": 302.199, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "shoulder incline and getting that down at this this red uh rod and it it just makes it simpler if you're feeling like", "start": 311.6, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "that right side goes up and you turn in that incline again not turning around turning in that incline so that's why we", "start": 319.12, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "like to talk about winding up or right side High because it gets you in this incline where I I now have this relationship down at the ball and then I", "start": 328.88, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "can just go down that yeah exactly you can fall down that plane toward the ball I'm already in the slope ready to go versus being over here and having to", "start": 337.36, "duration": 18.52}

{"chunk": "in this rehearsal swing so got you right on the stripes on your shoulder so you're looks like your on it or just outside of it it but in your real swing", "start": 503.72, "duration": 17.238}
{"chunk": "when I film it earli you actually got on it so let's show him a real swing I think part of the reason I get on it is in my re swing what do I also do", "start": 512.599, "duration": 17.561}
{"chunk": "lowering a little bit yeah yeah so I'm feeling the same feel there but I don't compress as much in a practice swing yeah so okay a real swing", "start": 521.519, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "sure okay so we'll be able to slow that down and see you know roughly where your shoulders are is it going to be exactly on that Rod", "start": 533.0, "duration": 16.999}
{"chunk": "Maybe not maybe it'll be just slightly outside maybe it'll even be slightly inside we'll see it's going to be in that ballpark but it's definitely not out at your", "start": 546.24, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "pool no definitely not out there and this helps because when I turn and bend like this yeah I'm getting the proper", "start": 553.72, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "stretches so now when I go to unwind you'll see I get it's easy for me to get around I get really Unwound yeah where if I go here there's no way", "start": 562.079, "duration": 20.081}
{"chunk": "I'm unwinding right go ahead and set up again so if I go ahead and I'm going to put this alignment stick on that red rod", "start": 576.72, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "and hold it right here now go ahead and make a back swing turn for me so you can see this might actually be a good stretch or exercise to feel what you", "start": 585.24, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "need to do when you do that where did you feel that I feel I feel a stretch kind of I feel like this side of my rib cage is working up", "start": 595.079, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "and I'm creating a Bend yep I just feel like there's no slack in the system I just feel like I'm winding things yeah up so I can really explode you also have", "start": 603.399, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "a little hip hinge and if anything your right hip goes a little deeper not necessarily more way back around so much but it does go a little deeper and its", "start": 612.8, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "first move is actually toward the camera so as I start it goes toward the camera and then I wind wind wind and this", "start": 621.88, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "winding kind of starts to pull it around so we have a slight incline your pelvis yeah but there's also a bend in the the thoracic spine that's helping you get", "start": 629.279, "duration": 17.282}
{"chunk": "down to that ball as well so the thoracic spine has a little bit of curve in it and you can tell that because if we traced a line through my belt buckle", "start": 638.6, "duration": 16.278}
{"chunk": "or my belt line here it's on about this much incline yeah but my shoulders are on steeper a steeper so it's like it's", "start": 646.279, "duration": 21.282}
{"chunk": "creating a a triangle there yeah so Milo that relationship to the ball isn't just important at impact your down", "start": 655.16, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "swing it's also very important in your back swing and a lot of you at home if you could get that relationship a little bit better in your back swing that's", "start": 670.639, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "going to help you Coast through the shot so much more easily mhm so let's learn to wind up correctly versus turning off", "start": 679.399, "duration": 20.521}

{"chunk": "simple you could take a you know we have a broomstick here you got a golf club here's a long PVC pipe just put it across your chest I got to avoid the mic", "start": 696.76, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "here a little bit but put it across your chest let's go to the golf ball actually so let's assume that's my actually where I'm hitting I'm going to try to get this", "start": 706.6, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "stick sort of at that Red Rod or slightly inside side of it cuz my sticks below my shoulders right now but that gives me a nice understanding of where I", "start": 715.88, "duration": 20.36}
{"chunk": "need to get to in my back swing now notice I'm not lowering to make it happen I'm feeling right side", "start": 725.68, "duration": 20.96}
{"chunk": "going up so I stay somewhat tall right and then you could do it on the front end too to kind of match it um but", "start": 735.279, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "really if our Focus for this video we're really talking about winding up the system that's kind of the look I'm trying to get where I got that um PVC", "start": 744.6, "duration": 20.32}
{"chunk": "pipe sort of down at that broomstick like that now I'm ready to go my relationship with the ball is still there my eyes are", "start": 753.72, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "sort on it my I'm not having to peek over my left shoulder a lot of you at home are probably used to that one and this is just very complicated to hit", "start": 763.519, "duration": 17.921}
