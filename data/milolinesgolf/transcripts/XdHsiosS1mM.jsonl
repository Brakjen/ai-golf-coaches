{"chunk": "Bang. Bang. So that's my feel. Now, let's take that feel and apply it for a little", "start": 347.88, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "small punch-like shot. And so in this drill, what your goal is, we're going to wind up, load that trail wrist, and then", "start": 355.6, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "feel how to transport that loaded trail wrist through the golf ball. And you can see even over here", "start": 363.84, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "when I finished, my trail wrist is still loaded. So I haven't tried to throw that out.", "start": 372.16, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "For me, that unloading of the trail wrist is more of a physics phenomenon than something I try to", "start": 381.039, "duration": 16.041}
{"chunk": "do purposely. I'm letting things happen, not forcing them to happen. So, again, as I said at the beginning of the video,", "start": 388.52, "duration": 15.319}

{"chunk": "would say more than 80% of my students are in this way. Okay, they've actually thrown that angle out too soon.", "start": 404.639, "duration": 17.64}
