{"chunk": "square the reason being is now I'm not hitting down on it as much so I'm not coming from the inside as much okay and", "start": 332.53, "duration": 15.41}
{"chunk": "then as we get to the driver I actually like to have the stance slightly closed because with driver I'm actually catching it on the upward part of the", "start": 341.43, "duration": 18.33}
