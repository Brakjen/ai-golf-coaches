{"chunk": "okay henry so i have often heard throughout my life that a golf swing is fairly similar to a sidearm throw which is skipping a rock", "start": 12.24, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "right yes and no they have some similarities for sure because when i throw sidearm", "start": 21.92, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "what does my body do what do you notice there all right it clears out of the way clears out of the way what else is it doing putting in some side bands it's got some", "start": 29.679, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "side down okay now the difference is and this is where the real biomechanical guys will argue that's", "start": 38.079, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "different is when you throw something your shoulder actually goes very much external right", "start": 46.399, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "the out like the elbow almost driving a little bit the elbow drives way ahead and this has some flash speed like this which in a golf swing would not be very", "start": 53.76, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "stable it would also be a really good way to get hurt creating an impact with this shoulder in this external rotation", "start": 62.559, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "but it's a good thing there's actually two hands on a golf club so it's fairly difficult to get that much get that much because", "start": 71.36, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "anatomically it just doesn't want to work yeah so let's walk through what a skipping a rock looks like", "start": 79.28, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "so i'm going to throw one okay first try i threw one earlier hopefully my shoulder doesn't fall off since i have torn rotator cuff and i need tommy", "start": 86.96, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "john surgery but here we go skipping a rot not from golf that was pretty good oh", "start": 95.68, "duration": 15.758999999999999}
{"chunk": "not bad it skipped okay so when i did that you're going to be able", "start": 104.079, "duration": 16.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "to slow that down and show that my arm went from internally rotated my forearm will supinate", "start": 111.52, "duration": 20.719}
{"chunk": "my arm will externally rotate and i'll make my throwing motion and you'll really see my body is going to be well around cleared out i really have a", "start": 122.64, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "lot of that wrist extension we talk about a lot too yes yeah it's a there's a little more of a maybe", "start": 132.4, "duration": 15.758}
{"chunk": "of a flick to it right it's got a lot more flick than a and a lot more kind of flash speed than a hit in golf right", "start": 144.16, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "so we're not really looking for it we're looking for this thing to whip yeah but what creates this wrist scent well it's it's and honestly", "start": 152.879, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "what i noticed too is the groundwork right how you stepped into it and that little down motion that set the angle even more as", "start": 162.0, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "you cleared out of the way yeah so there i would say a lot of my what my body did was very similar to", "start": 170.319, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "what i would do in a golf swing that rock was terrible i gave you a faulty rock um so yeah i think if you can kind of", "start": 196.08, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "disconnect a little bit from what's going on here and really focus on the body the the legs the groundwork right and maybe a little bit of the", "start": 205.519, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "wrist work that's kind of where we see the similarities is that what you're saying yes okay for sure let's see you skip a rock but yeah there we go", "start": 214.4, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "maybe it's because we're like above the surface a little more it's a little difficult but let's do it all right oh my gosh", "start": 222.799, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "it clinked from corsap there you go you got a flat one here's a good flat one all right here we go oh we got the skipper look at", "start": 231.84, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
