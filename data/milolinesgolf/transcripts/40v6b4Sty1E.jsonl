{"chunk": "yeah good so it'll straighten later there you go that's", "start": 452.52, "duration": 16.358}
{"chunk": "it okay make it flow yeah that's weird here so there you go see how you dropped it and turned so", "start": 461.639, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "one more time put both hands on so you can kind of tie it all together so this is going to drop turn and then the the shallowing can you", "start": 474.319, "duration": 15.239}

{"chunk": "yeah so if you try to feel go back to the top one more time try to feel this side of your rib cage come down and then around so hold on do", "start": 525.48, "duration": 20.519999999999996}
{"chunk": "that one more time so it's got to go down and around did you feel the difference there that's", "start": 535.56, "duration": 16.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "better there you go it can't immediately go up if that starts to go up we're in trouble that feel that yeah perfect", "start": 543.6, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "there perfect now you got the the pattern does that make sense yeah okay sweet you got it now you have to figure out how to tie it all together", "start": 554.48, "duration": 19.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "into one thing right he's getting it looks a lot better already down and behind", "start": 566.279, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "yes how'd that feel it's h good come look at it pretty far for a little chipper I mean it's obviously foreign it", "start": 582.2, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "feels weird yeah it's night and day better now when you start down you can see how you're kind of falling into the ground there's not a lot of", "start": 590.92, "duration": 19.239}

{"chunk": "when you were first doing your rehearsals you still wanted this lead side to go up yeah you could see the first move is is dropping and you can", "start": 609.36, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "see how the the system is shallowing out but it's not happening because your Center is tilting away that's how you hit it solid it's when when you tilt away that's when you start missing It", "start": 617.0, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "Funky I think I like the thought of having my chest over it too like like you're saying here yeah cuz I my chest goes away from you know this is going", "start": 626.279, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "you know here and I go away yeah and what do you have to do so if your chest is making is getting farther from the ball what has to happen at the hand level there is a flex I go into flexion", "start": 635.279, "duration": 20.401}
{"chunk": "and then just give it a flick yeah nothing's compressed or hit but if your chest is going more into it like this", "start": 644.88, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "now it's going to have compression and the feel to me there is that I'm going to you know I feel like I'm going to stick my club stra in the ground right so I got to figure out how to shallow it", "start": 653.16, "duration": 15.918999999999999}
{"chunk": "so you shallow it and then the next piece of the puzzle to keep the club from sticking in the ground is you've got to keep turning and that's what earlier when I said your your there", "start": 661.639, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "wasn't quite enough rotation to match the amount of side Bend yeah so now once we're on top of it like this the only solution to keep from sticking it in the", "start": 669.519, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
