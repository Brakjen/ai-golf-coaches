{"chunk": "hey everybody Milo here I'm going to do a quick experiment just to show you guys the differences and how when and where we apply torque affects the club head", "start": 0.08, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "speed and a few other variables in our golf swing so stay tuned so what we have going on here today is I wanted to do a quick", "start": 9.04, "duration": 16.398}
{"chunk": "experiment just to see how the torqus I apply to the golf club how they affect speed and when I apply those torqus so", "start": 21.359, "duration": 17.962}
{"chunk": "we hear that we need to feel like we're releasing the club from the top okay so actually adding this tipping out motion we also", "start": 30.84, "duration": 19.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "hear that we need to feel like we unload the wrists from the top so that would be more like a casting motion and that would be one side of the", "start": 40.64, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "spectrum so early release so which would be know the swivel but having the swivel feel like I'm applying it back", "start": 49.64, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "here and then that would be letting the angle out so I'm going into ner early then the other side of the the Spectrum", "start": 57.92, "duration": 17.158}
{"chunk": "would be feeling as if I'm never letting any of those angles out so I'm going to feel like I'm actually holding them back okay and then we'll go to somewhere in", "start": 67.119, "duration": 17.962}
{"chunk": "the middle where I'm neither adding Force nor holding anything back and just see kind of where things shake out so", "start": 76.28, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "let's start with the feeling of letting the angles unwind like I'm adding this torque early the tip out torque and just", "start": 83.32, "duration": 20.12}
{"chunk": "see what kind of speed we produce and mind you I'm I'm giving these about all I got so 82 miles hour", "start": 93.88, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "105 ball speed let's see again I'm going to get after it it's so hard for me feels like it just stifles me that slowed me down even", "start": 105.399, "duration": 19.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "more I really tried to release that one hard and early get that thing moving out of the top okay you notice they're going left", "start": 118.439, "duration": 17.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "so club path is to the right but the club face is to the left okay so now let's try the feeling of casting so I am", "start": 129.399, "duration": 21.96}
{"chunk": "going to feel as though I am throwing the club down in this direction kind of behind me and then turning whoops didn't", "start": 139.76, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "mean to hit that one so here we go let's feel like we cast it so 80 miles per hour let's do it", "start": 149.08, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "again really feel the get that moving back behind", "start": 163.239, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "me that one felt pretty good o 78 miles per hour okay let's try", "start": 170.319, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "it again one more try okay no good now we're going to go to the other side of the spectrum so now for the next", "start": 178.28, "duration": 17.042}
{"chunk": "three balls my goal is I'm going to feel as though I'm never releasing any angles but I'm going to try to hit them hard so we're going to hit these balls as hard", "start": 194.0, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "as I can and feel like I don't release angles it's not actually possible I don't think but it's going to feel like this okay", "start": 202.36, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "so 92 miles hour what the ball speed do 127 H that's a little different okay hold that back", "start": 215.439, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "as much as I can okay 89 miles hour I really held that", "start": 224.239, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "one off hard tried to feel like I never let it go hold on that was pretty", "start": 236.519, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "good so 91 miles hour more or less 131 ball speed that's actually pretty good okay now we're going to go to the third", "start": 249.36, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "one which is just take the tension out and let the club unwind without me", "start": 258.04, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "adding any torque manually just letting it kind of happen on its own so let's see what that does I Mish hit that one slightly that", "start": 266.0, "duration": 18.838}
{"chunk": "was 96 131 okay let's do it again okay", "start": 279.759, "duration": 20.081}
{"chunk": "97 hit a little toey give it one more got to catch one clean it hit that last one pretty", "start": 296.479, "duration": 16.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "good so 97 and 134 so me not applying a early Force makes me faster at least with seven iron let's try the", "start": 314.96, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "same hypothesis with a three-wood don't have a t so I'm not going to be able to hit driver but I'll hit three-wood off the ground here okay so we'll start with feeling early", "start": 324.12, "duration": 22.359}
{"chunk": "release get that club tipping out early better switch track man to three-wood okay so let's see what we get", "start": 334.759, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "here almost swinging missed 104 let's try it again really feel that", "start": 350.16, "duration": 19.642}
{"chunk": "release happening early okay 102 what if I just try to tip it out but don't unhinge my wrist", "start": 361.12, "duration": 17.682}
{"chunk": "so oh then I don't hit it in the air okay 100 now let's try the feeling of casting so I'm going to cast it back", "start": 376.84, "duration": 19.56}
{"chunk": "here that makes it impossible to hit solid let's try it again cast it out really feel getting", "start": 386.88, "duration": 19.719}
{"chunk": "energy there trying to turn I hit that one pretty good slow 96 miles per hour last", "start": 400.319, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "one okay that's hard 97 now I'm going to hit the next three feeling as though there is no release in", "start": 415.919, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "this swing I'm trying with all I'm worth to hold arms back Club back everything back so that sped me up to", "start": 425.039, "duration": 21.28}
{"chunk": "108 just holding it all back let's do it again hold it back hold", "start": 442.479, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "back okay 110 165 well let's hit the last one of those", "start": 454.44, "duration": 20.96}
{"chunk": "holders where I really feel like trying not to let it release I'm actually trying to put a backwards torque on it the entire time make the club go", "start": 464.24, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "back okay 109 162 so now rather than holding anything back or", "start": 475.759, "duration": 21.362000000000002}
{"chunk": "throwing anything out everything out we're just going to let it swing naturally let the angles unload on their", "start": 485.96, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "own when they want to see what that does whoops we need another one we fatted that one it was fast but not", "start": 494.24, "duration": 21.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "after all the weird swings hard to make my swing okay so 117", "start": 510.84, "duration": 15.639}
{"chunk": "176 now we're talking some speed so 116 and 172 okay last one okay so 117 and", "start": 525.959, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "173 now my hypothesis is that when I apply any outward Force early it causes", "start": 546.76, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "my Pivot speed to slow down significantly it also begins lining the club up to me so I don't have as much", "start": 554.68, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "ability to get this parametric acceleration out late anytime I feel any Force Happening Here my body responds by", "start": 563.44, "duration": 21.921}
{"chunk": "slowing down and standing up if I can feel the force of delayed I feel like I don't ever actually apply any but what", "start": 574.04, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "happens is everything's really loaded when my left side gets out of the way the club slingshots and the speed ramps way up so", "start": 583.16, "duration": 16.92}
