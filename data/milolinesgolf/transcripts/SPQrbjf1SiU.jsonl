{"chunk": "now we're going to see the timing of that how my left side starts to open up my arm gets kind of thrown against my body", "start": 78.08, "duration": 16.0}

{"chunk": "the loading phase my arm is working back and my body starts to unwind slightly ahead of my arm", "start": 94.96, "duration": 15.919}
