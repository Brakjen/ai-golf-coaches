{"chunk": "it pretty complicated I don't feel like it is I think to me one it's in my opinion a vulnerable place to put your", "start": 63.3, "duration": 15.42}

{"chunk": "actually have people hit something yeah let's show them like a basket so I'll put a basket or something in front of somebody and then I'll have them flip", "start": 88.74, "duration": 15.779}
{"chunk": "their Club upside down and I don't tell them how to hit the basket I just say hit the basket hit it hard yeah and then after about five hits", "start": 96.479, "duration": 17.979}
{"chunk": "I say stop and look at how your hand is when it hits the basket and so far I've tested it on a few thousand people not just like one or two", "start": 107.64, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "and zero people have ever hit it with a bow lead wrist unless they were really taught that one from a young age which goes to our point", "start": 116.1, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "with more cowl and ROM they've likely been doing that since they started but even those guys if I gave them a stick and said go hit a tree and guarantee you", "start": 125.159, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "they wouldn't hit it like this yeah because their subconscious is smart enough to know how to protect it so they have learned to match that up Square the", "start": 133.56, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "face but naturally that's it's kind of it's not a natural motion for most of us and it's also a vulnerable position as", "start": 141.239, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "you as you said earlier so Milo you're also former baseball player so that grip also aligns with a baseball bat you", "start": 149.16, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "don't see many baseball players that gripping the bat like that do you I've never seen anybody ever hit the ball with a flex lead wrist with a bat yeah", "start": 157.14, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "you don't do it everybody hits Knuckles up there's actually a little bit of extension in the wrist at impact so part of why you know it's my", "start": 166.2, "duration": 20.04}
{"chunk": "preference but it's also a lot easier for the average person to deliver good impact Dynamics so the right amount of", "start": 176.04, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "shaft lean Square Face out of that slightly stronger grip generally yeah and we and we've done a video on this before with the bowed left wrist and why", "start": 184.379, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "I don't know I feel like there's a little bit of a fad with that that look and you know obviously you have great players that are employing that or have", "start": 194.58, "duration": 19.081}
{"chunk": "employed that but again they've probably been doing it since they were very young a lot of them are still very young but they're on tour so why why would the stronger left hand", "start": 204.18, "duration": 19.560000000000002}

{"chunk": "deliver it with this kind of a flexed look so turn down bow a lot more supination in the forearm a lot a lot of", "start": 231.72, "duration": 17.879}
{"chunk": "flexion in the wrist yeah that can be a lot more difficult to to be able to time and match up and you see", "start": 241.379, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "a lot of the guys that have that weaker left hand that use it well they also look to have a bit of a stronger right hand", "start": 250.019, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "yeah so why why would that maybe match up for them is that so they can kind of keep their right hand under their her right arm right side under the left", "start": 258.6, "duration": 15.9}
{"chunk": "through impact when I'd say it's the relationship between the the left and the right so if the right hand is stronger than the left when you hinge", "start": 267.419, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "your your Trail hand or Trail hand stronger than the left than the lead when you hinge your Trail hand it automatically puts that", "start": 276.24, "duration": 15.538}
{"chunk": "that lead hand into flexion so a guy like murakawa if you look at his grip he's got a neutral to slightly strong trail hand yeah and an extremely", "start": 283.979, "duration": 20.882}
{"chunk": "weak lead hand like you don't yeah you probably can't even put your hand on like this I don't think I can but that that's when he when he extends", "start": 294.24, "duration": 17.86}
{"chunk": "that trail wrist it never so often talk about that gets him that bold look at the top yep", "start": 304.8, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "and then he has to really feel like he is turning the knuckles on his lead hand down yeah", "start": 312.84, "duration": 16.9}
{"chunk": "like this as he goes through the golf ball so for those of you at home that maybe have tried in the past to get Knuckles down back of the hand of the", "start": 321.96, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "target glove logo to the Target down to the ground any of that feel maybe you've had some struggles with that in the past", "start": 329.94, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "I know I did yeah it's I've experimented with it and it literally makes it so I can't hit the ball", "start": 336.84, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "me too it gets kind of a cool look at the top no doubt oh yeah having a little bit of that bow I could actually still hit it straight", "start": 345.32, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "but it takes my speed from yeah you know I'm pretty fast and then I go really slow yeah because I have to try so hard to me there's a lot of speed in this", "start": 353.699, "duration": 19.381}
{"chunk": "we know there's a lot of speed in this so we we've done videos with your your sort of match up how you kind of have that almost butterfly look here versus", "start": 363.6, "duration": 21.72}
{"chunk": "hands opposing yes that's my preference I found it's way easier to create good impact Dynamics and let's show them a", "start": 374.46, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "little bit of why so we've got a couple little yeah so we got the hanger out here so the hanger is a great training aid we've used in the past you've probably seen a couple of our videos", "start": 383.639, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "I'll link them I love the hanger but if you look at how I've got it set up you can see the Leading Edge is pointing up on my golf club while this one is more", "start": 391.979, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "on a diagonal almost a 45 degree angle what that does is it gets me set up where the Hanger's rail is resting on my", "start": 400.8, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "trail forearm at a dress and then it gives me the opportunity when my wrists hinge so when I put my", "start": 408.72, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "trail wrist into extension and add a little bit of radio or like a hammering motion into my my lead wrist", "start": 416.46, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "now it's resting on my lead forearm but the face is still slightly towed down so I can deliver it with my rotation square", "start": 424.38, "duration": 20.579}
{"chunk": "with shaft lean where most people when they set this up they put it more vertical you know match this this face to that one if I do that in order to hit", "start": 434.88, "duration": 18.901000000000003}
{"chunk": "it I just experimented with it off camera really I had to throw the angles at it and hit it with the shaft pointing straight back at me I couldn't have any lean in the shot otherwise that thing", "start": 445.44, "duration": 17.578}
{"chunk": "would be really digging into your forearm and this blocked me yeah so getting that aligned for those of you that do already have the hanger that's", "start": 454.199, "duration": 17.221}
{"chunk": "really important even if you have a more neutral weak grip we found that having that face a little more to the right is helpful yeah but in your case with a", "start": 462.3, "duration": 20.881}
{"chunk": "stronger grip you have this what a good 30 degrees right of that face would you say something like that something like that it's a lot yeah so it looks like", "start": 472.62, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "that that face on the hanger is pointed way out to right field yep but that's going to allow you to set the Angles and get this helpful little", "start": 481.139, "duration": 20.039}
{"chunk": "alignment here up his left arm so then he can turn and burn into impact and I can just deliver this now look", "start": 491.099, "duration": 15.482000000000001}
{"chunk": "where that glove low is pointing just so you guys are clear it's up on a 45 sort out towards right field and a little bit up towards the sky is it pointed the", "start": 499.56, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "same direction as this face yeah would you believe it so it's not down at the Target it's not down to the ground", "start": 508.5, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "for that strong grip so know your matchups if you do have a weak grip well you probably are going to want a little bit of that turned down is it our", "start": 517.26, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "preference no we always say preference right yeah because there are great players that do both yeah there's for me grip is not necessarily a fundamental", "start": 525.66, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "it's a preference and it can make the golf swing a lot easier so I'm just going to hit a couple Henry let's do it and you're going to be able to slow", "start": 534.959, "duration": 15.541}
{"chunk": "these down and show that I'm able to deliver some lean into the in the shaft well I'm not gonna hit any more that was", "start": 542.88, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "perfect [Music] there you go you just clipped it off the top and it was nice and low so that's a", "start": 555.12, "duration": 19.070999999999998}
{"chunk": "good tool that you can add to your Arsenal but be aware again of the grip and the match-ups how to align this so you can get the shaft lean without", "start": 573.3, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "bashing your left arm there's a lot of good training AIDS like that that actually sort of punish you if you do it the wrong way but setting them up", "start": 581.82, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "correctly is important too yep so for that reason we don't always use or recommend training AIDS a lot of the stuff we do is actually without them but", "start": 589.26, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "the ones we use we want to make sure we use them right and safely exactly so if you at home have a really strong grip say like Matt Fitzpatrick or Brendan", "start": 598.38, "duration": 19.56}
{"chunk": "Steele Paul azinger back in the day or you got a really weak grip like John ROM Colin murakawa I was like maybe a legend that of old it might had a weaker", "start": 607.56, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "grip then Hogan maybe a little bit yeah Ben Hogan's group was pretty neutral yeah we might get slapped in the face for that one yeah I've looked at this", "start": 616.98, "duration": 15.539}
{"chunk": "group a lot it's neutral two Knuckles yeah so whatever you guys might have just know your matchups we our preference is a stronger left hand that doesn't mean", "start": 624.839, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "you have to play that way you've coached playing players that have a more neutral maybe even a little weak left hand if you're already a good player I don't usually touch your grip too much but if", "start": 633.839, "duration": 16.621}
{"chunk": "you come to me and you're an 18 handicap and you've been playing for 20 years and your grip's really weak I might say okay this could be part of your problem I have seen a lot of really good players", "start": 642.06, "duration": 17.7}
