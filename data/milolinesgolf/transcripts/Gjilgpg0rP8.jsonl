{"chunk": "place yes beautiful so there is a very nice strike ball went out to the right a little bit", "start": 442.72, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "so again it's just about a fine balance that makes me think well what if you just bent that thing just a hair there's all kinds of that time I actually Swang full speed and it felt like the shaft", "start": 455.479, "duration": 16.28}

{"chunk": "spot on the club a ball that wants to curve the rough is longer and the greens are longer and bumpier you swing it really good you have to swing it better so the environment forced their swings", "start": 541.519, "duration": 19.64}
