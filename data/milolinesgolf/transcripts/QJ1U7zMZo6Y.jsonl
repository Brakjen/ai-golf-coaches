{"chunk": "today I'm going to be sharing with you guys one of my favorite drills to create lag in the downswing so here's what it looks", "start": 0.04, "duration": 15.398}
{"chunk": "like that was pretty sweet so stick around we're going to show you how to do this and why it'll be so beneficial to your golf", "start": 12.36, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "swing so we're back out here at the beautiful Golf Club here at Superstition Mountain with he came all the way in from San Diego cuz he wanted to visit me", "start": 25.039, "duration": 17.561}
{"chunk": "so bad oh of course so let's let's walk him through what this drill is and who this is for one of the more common", "start": 33.44, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "things we see with players is not loading the wrist correctly mhm and if they do get them loaded correctly", "start": 40.8, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "powering the system incorrectly yeah they power it way too early and uh a lot of bad things happen at the bottom and I think in an effort to square up this", "start": 49.48, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "club face often times people are trying to apply Force really early with their hands yes and which when they do that often we'll", "start": 58.8, "duration": 21.399}
{"chunk": "see this big window through here yeah it's something that I see in my Online Academy kind of almost daily if I go through and scroll through and look at", "start": 68.799, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "oh yeah images some of the telltale signs of a player that's casting it number one they're probably not shifting", "start": 78.159, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "pressure correctly so they're they certainly haven't done early enough yeah they're not early enough yes so that that leaves them somewhat powerless and", "start": 86.88, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "the last piece of the chain that they have power in is hands and arms as hard as they can and so the next thing we start to see is we see this", "start": 95.28, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "club starting to line itself up really early so there's no there's no angle no and once you start that it's", "start": 104.24, "duration": 16.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "inevitable you're going to be like this because it's not like you can start throwing this and then catch your body up it's there's not enough time in the golf swing for that it's over it's", "start": 116.96, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "impossible and almost always something earlier in the chain could be part of the problem could be now this drill we have here will force you to do a lot of", "start": 125.68, "duration": 17.561}
{"chunk": "things correctly however and so what this this drill is it's the open palm drill so you swing the club", "start": 134.36, "duration": 15.079}
{"chunk": "back and then you open your fingers and now the goal is we don't want the club to disconnect from this Palm", "start": 141.519, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "maybe it'll happen over here late when the the energy escapes so if I don't want it to to come off my palm I can't", "start": 150.879, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "throw it fast I can't apply pressure early because if I do oh it's gone I'm never catching back up again so I've got to feel like I'm using my body to tow", "start": 159.599, "duration": 20.841}
{"chunk": "that system around yes and keep the force on the back of the shaft long enough actually when I do that I actually ask them to open it at a dress", "start": 169.84, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "and take it away like that and the reason I do that is for them to create leverage they have to create width and if they don't have width they can't keep", "start": 178.04, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "leverage cuz their lead arm is are strong enough yeah so they have to keep width the whole time and you can't hold", "start": 186.519, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "it like this there's no leverage now it's all in your left hand so the Leverage is you pushing away with your right hinging the right yeah and then", "start": 193.879, "duration": 15.161999999999999}
{"chunk": "you have to maintain it so I actually do it from the start all the way to the fence so you'll have them open that up yep and move it along that exactly so I", "start": 201.72, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "really like that adjustment to the drill starting with it open from a dress so that you have to establish some of these angles earlier and maintain that width", "start": 210.879, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "that's really nice also it doesn't eliminate radial but we tend to prefer a little more extension than radial even though there might be a little radial", "start": 220.36, "duration": 17.319}
{"chunk": "moving into a greater extension it's hard to go radial and keep pressure on the shaft extension is kind of where it", "start": 229.12, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "is and that extension actually squares the club up to my back line if I'm in radial I kind of lose leverage cuz I'm not pushing away as much and now the", "start": 236.48, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "face is open to the Target line so that's why it kind of promotes more extension in the troll wrist by doing it earlier just so we're clear not", "start": 246.0, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "everybody probably understands what radial and extension so radial hinge is the upward hinging of my wrist this way", "start": 254.799, "duration": 17.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "and extension is the backward hinging of my wrist in this way so if I'm set up here and I'm hinging this in the radial manner that", "start": 263.0, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "thing can kind of almost want to slide off where if I'm in more of extension pushing it away I'm keeping some some pressure on there keeping it taut we", "start": 272.72, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "want leverage cuz we know leverage turns out into be speed once you lose leverage you will seek to find power and speed somewhere and usually it's not in a good", "start": 281.919, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "place one of the big reasons we want this leverage or lag is that when you throw it out of the top you you kind", "start": 290.639, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "gave away your leverage early and now your your potential for Speed is is gone not just that but your Dynamic loft is", "start": 299.919, "duration": 19.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "horrible the last thing you want to do is we would rather see you take your eight iron and make it into a seven with some extension and some shaft lean and", "start": 309.039, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "that speed more forward but if you're doing this I'm making it into a nine or an eight iron and my low points all over the place so good luck trying to hit it", "start": 317.88, "duration": 17.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "at your target ability to make good contact it's a kind of goes out the window when you start unloading things too soon so let me show you really", "start": 326.84, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "slowly from down the line what this looks like to show you that exaggeration so you really get the picture of what we're working on here so I'm going to", "start": 334.72, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "open my palm right at the beginning believe it or not moving that slowly and hitting it that solidly", "start": 342.759, "duration": 15.602}
{"chunk": "is very difficult yes you just have to have I to get luy 100 million times so yes I wasn't expecting to hit it perfect so one thing to keep in mind is you have", "start": 360.52, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "to be okay Mish hitting some of these when you're working through a drill like this work on the movement make the movement good you'll start putting the", "start": 369.96, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "the club face on the golf ball over the course of time and be a little gracious to yourself right te the ball up a little bit yeah it's a challenge and", "start": 378.759, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "take your expectations of performance be more realistic yeah I almost you flew that maybe 10 yard 15 yard maybe yeah and you're not trying to apply any more", "start": 386.84, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "effort than that it's really challenging not in the beginning for sure yeah yeah so I'm going to hit one more doing the exact same thing once I feel like I've", "start": 395.96, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "kind of got this motion then the next step is we can go ahead and close the fingers on the right hand lightly and do the same thing same speed so let's let's", "start": 404.56, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "see another one of those slow motion ones okay now my goal is to duplicate that", "start": 414.479, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "with fingers on the golf club so the the reason I really like this drill is it makes me feel almost like I'm needing to exaggerate this feeling", "start": 440.08, "duration": 20.48}
{"chunk": "of Trail wrist extension and the club pushing on my palm and then I need I feel like it needs to maintain itself", "start": 463.68, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "for a long time when I'm doing this drill so I'm never really feeling like I'm throwing or adding this this", "start": 472.28, "duration": 15.879000000000001}
{"chunk": "basketball shoot or cast at any point in the swing so it's really good for helping you feel how to move your body and keep things nice and stable and", "start": 479.479, "duration": 17.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "there's many other things when you guys see the face on videos you'll understand why it's such a beneficial drill a lot of times we see very very narrow at the", "start": 489.319, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "top because their left arm collapses or their right arm retracts too far by maintaining this leverage it's almost", "start": 497.52, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "forcing your Trail arm to be wider and we know with is your key rotation and being shallow you you almost can't do it this happens the other thing is that the", "start": 505.44, "duration": 20.639}
{"chunk": "wider this stays the more your chest has to turn thus the more the rest of the other good stuff happens so that's why", "start": 515.479, "duration": 16.121}
{"chunk": "this drill is so beneficial all the way down the chain get a lot of things for free just by focusing on yep maintaining that exactly so Ed I think I think", "start": 523.839, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "you're 100% right there and that's why if you go across our Channel we talk so much about Trail hand Trail wrist and how those elements align with how we", "start": 533.08, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "pivot they're kind of they go hand in hand if you don't use this correctly no pun intended so hopefully you all like", "start": 542.279, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
