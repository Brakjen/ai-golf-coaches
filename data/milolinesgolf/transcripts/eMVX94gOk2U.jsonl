{"chunk": "[Music] three keys well first of all before we get into the three keys what does it mean to delay the strike for a powerful impact", "start": 8.65, "duration": 18.311}
{"chunk": "are we not trying to hit it as soon as we can as hard as we can i'd rather not see it that way okay what about you i have a saying", "start": 20.8, "duration": 18.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "he who hits it latest hits it greatest you hits it latest it's the greatest so i don't want to hit the ball here i want to hit it", "start": 29.519, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "later i want to hit it over here where it feels like it's off to my right at first glance one might think that well that's not as powerful", "start": 37.92, "duration": 19.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "because you're hitting it later so isn't that slower what say you well i've actually studied this a little", "start": 47.36, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "bit in years and with some of the tour players you start their transitions at the exact same time their down swings the club starts moving", "start": 55.52, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "the player that hits it hits it first usually hits it with slower club head speed than the player who hits it last interesting and i would say ball speed", "start": 63.68, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "well for sure well club heads ball club head and ball speed are very closely intertwined pros hit in the middle of face generally so because we want to convert that", "start": 71.04, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "club right at the bottom so you get good impact yeah good compression whatever you want to call it if i accelerated the club", "start": 80.32, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "really fast out of the top i might actually get to the ball quicker than if i accelerated it later but i'll", "start": 89.92, "duration": 15.358}
{"chunk": "get there when i get to the ball my club head speed will be significantly lower we want the the angles to unwind a little later by nature of how we're", "start": 97.759, "duration": 16.642}
{"chunk": "moving that's basically what we're getting at yeah let's go into these three keys then you kind of have an order to these too that you we talked", "start": 106.24, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "about off camera so what is sort of your first key first key is kind of rotation in the wind up so rotation in general both back", "start": 113.6, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "and through we want to make sure that our pivoting motion is uninhibited it's free-flowing and it has there's a lot of it so a lot of", "start": 123.28, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "rotation in our foundations for our site that's the very first thing we cover we get people's pivot working better we've got a series of drills we do help people", "start": 132.16, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "feel how to pivot yeah because if you look at a player from face on right it'll look like okay well they have they have some shaft lean they have", "start": 141.92, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "certain risk conditions but how did they really get there right and what you what you see is that the rotation actually creates a lot of that", "start": 151.36, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "shaft lane that we're looking for now some don't need as much as others we've talked about this but for higher ball speed players like", "start": 160.48, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "us right shaffleen we we want some of that so the rotation can help achieve that it's not just getting the hands forward", "start": 168.319, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "yeah it's a combination of rotation coupled with our key number two which is how our wrists work so risk conditions okay so when i swing back i", "start": 176.319, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "want to load my wrists and what i mean by load the wrist mainly i'm talking about the trail wrist i want to feel like i get it", "start": 185.599, "duration": 16.081999999999997}
{"chunk": "loaded into a position where it's fully extended back what the lead wrist looks like will depend on how we grip it we", "start": 194.0, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "have our preferences which would be a slightly stronger grip so the the wrists actually don't work exactly in the same they're not there one's not", "start": 201.84, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "going extension and the other going flexion one the right wrist is going extension and the left wrist is going more into radial hinge", "start": 210.319, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "and flattening it's flattening itself out but my key would be trail wrist extension so we've got to load that trail wrist and get that trail arm", "start": 218.159, "duration": 20.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "structure correct yeah okay so and then if you use the remove some of these balls if you use that grip we talked about", "start": 227.92, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "with that stronger left hand put that right wrist into extension the face is still square really if i turn and turn back", "start": 236.4, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "well once you know it i have shaft lean yeah right so that matches up with that rotation so shaft lean is basically", "start": 244.72, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "however much i retained angle i still have in this wrist so let's say there's neutral let's say i turn that back 20 degrees well now i've got to make up", "start": 252.56, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "for it with 20 degrees of chest rotation to get the club to the ball so now that now i've got shackling there you go so so how do we", "start": 262.24, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "i guess tie those two together how do we marry everything and that's sequence sequence key number three is sequence we want to make sure", "start": 270.8, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "that we're changing directions in the proper chain reaction proper order now it", "start": 280.24, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "doesn't always look exactly the same for everybody not everybody is going to be pelvis chest", "start": 287.919, "duration": 15.042}
{"chunk": "arms club but we definitely want to have the change of direction the pressure change directions before the club does so we want to feel like we're really", "start": 294.8, "duration": 16.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "right left while the club is still going this way then we can start to unwind from the middle out", "start": 303.919, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "that's our key so if we can unwind from the middle out this thing accelerates last and it gets to the ball", "start": 311.919, "duration": 15.042}
{"chunk": "last it's almost like the club to a certain extent with our rotation with the good sequence mixed in", "start": 319.12, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "with our good wrist conditions the club almost becomes a little bit heavy and we get to toe that club along for a", "start": 326.32, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "ride and that strike gets delayed into a more natural good timing that we want versus it being forced i like to think of it like the", "start": 334.16, "duration": 18.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "tip of a whip yeah so this is the tip of the whip and our body is creating that whipping motion i don't want to", "start": 343.919, "duration": 16.642000000000003}
{"chunk": "try to get the tip of the whip to win the race i want that thing to be last and it snaps fast all by itself i don't have to", "start": 352.88, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "try to muscle it with my hands late let's see if we can give them a little bit of a demonstration on how we might go about", "start": 360.96, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "doing all three of these at once okay so i like to use a few little drills i'm not going to give away all my secrets but one really good drill for", "start": 369.6, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "how to feel this would would be to feel like you're you swing the club back and as the club is going back you change directions and the club", "start": 378.88, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "naturally just shallows out and whips into the ball something along those lines so the club's still going back as you're going", "start": 388.72, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "lead side around so you get your turn you get your wrist condition and then the sequence you're almost that's your focus that's what's", "start": 396.56, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "really driving this and the other two kind of fall into place exactly let's see shall i hit one yeah so i'll do that little drill it's kind of a little buggy", "start": 413.12, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "whip grill buggy whip and there you go i just chipped that ball pretty good chip it's like 150 yards a", "start": 421.919, "duration": 16.322}
{"chunk": "little bullet too yeah a little low bullet so straight as a string with that later hit you're going to probably see a little bit better ball flight going out a", "start": 432.08, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "little more piercing a little more piercing especially with these drill swings until you build it up yep then we can start to you know maybe let things go a little bit more but", "start": 440.4, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "at first learning how to slow down and sequence it right and sort of assemble these three things together", "start": 449.28, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "that's where we want to start right for sure gotta figure out how to tie it all together and then we can start pouring gas on it see how fast we can make it go", "start": 456.56, "duration": 17.598999999999997}
{"chunk": "all right guys well there's three keys for you on how to create that delayed strike that i know a lot of you guys at home are looking for we've done", "start": 465.599, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "a great video in the past on the five keys to creating a rotational golf swing so i'm going to add that above i think you guys should watch that one it has a", "start": 474.56, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "couple of these keys in there and a couple more that i think they can tie in as well so i think that video is awesome that basically covers our ideas", "start": 483.44, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "in a nutshell yeah now if you're looking for more one-on-one instruction or how to implement some of these things we're", "start": 492.4, "duration": 15.041}
