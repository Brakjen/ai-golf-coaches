{"chunk": "how players hold a golf club and how I feel like you should hold a golf club so that you can give yourself the best chance to swing like an athlete. So,", "start": 20.32, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "let's just talk about some different varieties of grips. First off, the number one player in the world currently, John Rom, has what I would", "start": 29.519, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "consider a fairly weak left-hand grip. So, when he grips the club, you really can't see any knuckles on his left hand, and there he probably can't see the logo on his golf club. The logo is pointing", "start": 37.6, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "more or less toward the target, thumb straight down the golf club. And then his right hand goes on in fairly a fairly neutral manner. Okay? So,", "start": 46.879, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "generally players who have this variety of grip, you're going to see some some commonalities, and I'll I'll talk to you", "start": 55.92, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "about those in just a second. The next type of golf grip would be more of what many would call neutral. And that would be where", "start": 63.68, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "you look down and you probably see two maybe two and a half knuckles and then the right hand goes on more or less how pointed the same direction as the club", "start": 72.64, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "face. And then a strong left-hand grip would be turned where you could see all four knuckles. I've even seen some players on tour like Daniel Burgerer and", "start": 80.64, "duration": 20.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "a couple of others whose left hand grip looks like this where you can see the whole logo. It's more or less pointing back at the camera and then the the right hand goes on. Generally with those", "start": 91.439, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "players, the right hand's a little stronger as well. Okay. Now, how do players match those up to be able to get", "start": 100.32, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "the face back square? Well, typically a player who has a a weaker left, almost always they have what I would consider a neutral right hand. So, their right hand", "start": 107.439, "duration": 20.161}
{"chunk": "works to hinge into extension and flexion. So, it extends like this, which makes the left wrist look a little bit bowed. So, we see that with guys like", "start": 117.6, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "Colin Morawa, uh John Rom, Jordan Speath, and a few others. Okay? So, that's how they're squaring the face up. Now, those guys", "start": 127.68, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "when they arrive at impact are generally arriving with the knuckles on the left hand kind of curled under like this. Something like that to create the lean", "start": 136.879, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "in the shaft and compress the ball the way they want to. Okay. Now, in my opinion, that's kind of a compromised position for the left wrist. It wouldn't", "start": 145.92, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "be my preference if I was starting a golfer. Now, if you're already really good and that's how you control the face, then we might not want to change", "start": 154.16, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "it. Okay. Now, a neutral grip at impact, their left wrist is going to look maybe slightly bowed, but more or less flat,", "start": 161.2, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "okay, at impact, but the right wrist will still be laid back some amount. And a strong grip, like a really strong grip,", "start": 172.319, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "when those guys arrive at impact, they might actually still have just a little bit of extension in the left wrist. So, it won't be flat. Definitely won't be", "start": 181.68, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "bowed because if they get that left wrist bowed, you know, the face is pointed at their left foot. That's not going to work very good. Okay. So, now", "start": 191.04, "duration": 19.919}
{"chunk": "let's get into how an athlete should grip a golf club and what would be natural. So, if I gave you a stick and I said, I want you to walk over and hit", "start": 200.48, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "something with it. Almost 100% of the time, you're going to see the person hit in this manner with their left hand.", "start": 209.68, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "Okay. And that's because that joint is very strong when it lands like this. It's not nearly as strong like this. Or if I gave you a tennis racket and said", "start": 217.04, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "backhand something, you're going to twist your grip on there so that you can hit it and have that joint stable. So my preference would be to have a grip", "start": 226.319, "duration": 18.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "that slightly airs to the strong side with your left hand. So we can hit things with our left hand", "start": 235.04, "duration": 16.639}

{"chunk": "from extension toward flexion. So, the right hand, my preference would be for it to go on where the palm is more or less matching up to the face. So, when", "start": 260.88, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "it extends and and flexes, the face doesn't really open or close. It just swings the club back and through. Okay, so that would be my preference for the", "start": 269.68, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "right hand. Now, on this glove, we've drawn some lines. I love for the golf club to run right through that space.", "start": 278.08, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "Most common when I look at players grips, I see them grip it in this manner where the club's running right through their palm and their thumb is going", "start": 288.0, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "straight down the club like this. This is kind of the the beginner grip. I see it all the time. So hopefully that's not you. And if it", "start": 295.84, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "is, here's your solution. We want the club to run slightly on a diagonal through the base of the fingers. Okay.", "start": 306.16, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "And then on the right hand, the same kind of a thing. The club's going to be right at the base of the fingers and wrapped around. Now, the last thing I want to talk about", "start": 314.72, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "is the different varieties of grips. So there's what I use would be considered an overlap grip or the Varden. Okay,", "start": 324.24, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "other players who are pretty darn good like Jack Nicholson and Tiger Woods, they interlock. Now, a really common pitfall I see amongst players who", "start": 333.039, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "interlock is they try to bury their fingers so that the webbing on the pinky and on the index finger on the left hand, they bury them together. Now, your", "start": 341.6, "duration": 17.28}

{"chunk": "tip of your pinky finger is just going to barely be touching the webbing on your index finger on the left hand. Okay? So, if you're going to go that way, and then I also see players with 10", "start": 358.479, "duration": 19.201999999999998}

{"chunk": "nobody who I know who's good because you can't make much speed like that. So, get your hands together if you're going to hold it with all 10. So to review, my", "start": 377.039, "duration": 16.402}
{"chunk": "preference is to hold the golf club in a way that you can use your left hand in its most stable functionality so that", "start": 384.96, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "this joint is not compromised. I don't want you to get hurt. So that's going to require you to grip it in your fingers and with a slightly strong grip. Okay?", "start": 392.4, "duration": 18.24}
