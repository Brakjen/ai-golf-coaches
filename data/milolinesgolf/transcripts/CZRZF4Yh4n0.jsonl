{"chunk": "little steep so he's going to be a little across that golf ball [Music] is", "start": 8.8, "duration": 17.899}
{"chunk": "i noticed that his setup his butt is way too far back if i drop a line", "start": 18.8, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "off of his hip socket right here straight down his hip socket significantly behind his ankles", "start": 26.72, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "anytime i see that i know that that's not going to stay that way when we make it dynamic so as he starts to move we're going to see", "start": 36.399, "duration": 20.399}
{"chunk": "how much that right hip moves forward so instead of his right or instead how much his left hip move forward so instead of his right hip moving back", "start": 46.239, "duration": 17.122}
{"chunk": "we we have his left hip moving forward toward the ball okay and then he's one of those that as he's approaching the top of his swing", "start": 54.96, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "he starts to flex his knees and sink into the ground so and he's got a lot of hip turn there probably more than we really need", "start": 65.68, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "i do like the bends he's got probably not enough trail wrist extension at the top of his back swing", "start": 75.2, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "so what's this gonna do this is the first time i've looked at this motion he actually pivots pretty decent from there but", "start": 83.36, "duration": 15.358}
{"chunk": "because his left hips move forward and he doesn't have enough trail wrist extension he's a little steep so he's going to be a little across that", "start": 91.119, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "golf ball and you can see how his his knees look like they they scissor a little too much the right", "start": 100.88, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "knee moves forward the left knee moves back a little too much he's actually doing pretty good to be able to manage", "start": 114.24, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "that setup as well as he does but that's the main thing i'm seeing is we fixed the setup get the the hip joint a little bit more over the", "start": 122.24, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "ankle not so far back then he's going to be able to move better in the back swing and we add in a little bit of", "start": 131.039, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "trail wrist extension keep that right leg long don't let it start to sink too soon and we're going to be golden", "start": 139.92, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "let me flip over to his face on motion now you can see as he starts back here's one that we might widen our stance a", "start": 149.599, "duration": 16.083000000000002}
{"chunk": "little bit this looks like a seven iron and his feet are more or less under his hips ball position too far forward too the", "start": 159.04, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "ball positions the hair forward well that plays in that yeah what happened what needs to happen is his left foot needs to get", "start": 166.879, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "kicked out a little bit and then we talked a little bit about foot flare too yeah we could add a little bit of flare into the left foot his right foot is a little more flared than his left one", "start": 176.879, "duration": 17.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "so he shifts outside of his ankles a little bit and then he does a pretty good job of re-centering things back up but he starts flexing into the ground a", "start": 185.44, "duration": 16.477999999999998}
{"chunk": "little sooner than i would want to see it happen it moves pretty pretty athletically this this pretty athletic motion here", "start": 195.28, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "it's got some potential here oh yeah if you set up issues he might have though i think that the main thing i see here is just fixing that setup and getting", "start": 206.239, "duration": 18.160000000000004}
{"chunk": "the pelvis to move correctly in the backswing and get the wrist to move correctly in the back swing and i think we'll be", "start": 216.239, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "in business here because the sequencing of the motion you can see that his hands and arms are still going up as his pelvis starts to", "start": 223.68, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "fall and turn there's a lot of good stuff here we just need to fix a few structural things and this building will stand up nice", "start": 233.519, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "what else do you see ed that's exactly about seeing the ball position and that initial sway off the ball so that would", "start": 241.599, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "be stopped by the wider stance and and you are correct he does not have enough extension at the top of that and he does not turn the doorknob", "start": 249.439, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "yeah but he almost can't do that because of where his body's moved to and the sway that i would prefer to see he sways his pelvis out from under his", "start": 258.16, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "head a little too much i'd prefer to see the the upper body sway with the pelvis a little bit if we widen the base out", "start": 266.0, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "this is going to look real good so let's widen that stance out let's get those hip sockets", "start": 273.04, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "more over the top of the ankles and i think we're going to be good if you go back to the top real quick on", "start": 282.479, "duration": 17.122}
{"chunk": "the face on watch all that watch how that left hip goes down and around when he starts his down swing that's super good he's got great there's a lot of great movements", "start": 291.12, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "here just the same that's got so much potential oh my gosh just the structure of that right there is just a little off we need to", "start": 302.639, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "build that structure a little bit better get that right leg lengthened out a little bit yeah get that club that shaft maybe a little more in line", "start": 310.88, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "with that left arm so that center of there you go back over there some amount but that's going to happen now if that right wrist was extended that shaft", "start": 320.96, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "would be over there yeah exactly so yep it all has to do with the structural how we move the wrists", "start": 328.96, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "and how we set up the pelvis so it can move properly and then then we're good he might be a good example as you go", "start": 337.6, "duration": 16.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "into transition in that face on watch that left lat get engaged that last scapula that whole shoulder girdle is", "start": 345.6, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "like stretching like mad across there that's good to create that speed up front yep there's so much good here it's just steep", "start": 352.96, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "because of the structure he's got at the top and how his pelvis moved we get that we get that cleaned up and we're golden he said the um we talked about the", "start": 363.039, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "trigger finger he said that helped him with the wrist extension ah so a little bit of a grip change helped him with get it get more wrist extension", "start": 371.28, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah i think he was the one when i called you after i had seen a few people in a row with that grip issue", "start": 379.039, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "i think he was the one i video showing him like holding a knife yeah same idea is he 10 finger in that thing oh no he's got interlock", "start": 387.6, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "yep just need to work that that's all i really see i don't the dynamics of this motion are pretty good we widen the base out a little bit", "start": 397.919, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "we get the hips under him a little bit more he has nice bends yeah he kind of moves a little like cameron young doesn't he", "start": 406.16, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
{"chunk": "a little bit just doesn't get the club shout out as much cool that's all i see i'm not gonna i'm not gonna throw any more in there that's", "start": 413.919, "duration": 16.802}
{"chunk": "pretty it could be real good", "start": 423.28, "duration": 8.718}
