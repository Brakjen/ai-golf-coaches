{"chunk": "like you're hitting down on the golf ball the timing of the unloading of the wrists is the majority of it so wrists", "start": 191.34, "duration": 15.781}

{"chunk": "as much about the actual hand or the actual club or your right arm really going down into the golf ball", "start": 262.8, "duration": 18.48}

{"chunk": "lower on the face you don't want to hit it up the face so that was hit right on the button and we talked about another little feel they", "start": 477.599, "duration": 17.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "can add to this where they almost they almost just start with the club back here and just sweep up into the ball so they feel like that real shallow", "start": 487.74, "duration": 18.299}
{"chunk": "entry and it gets them turning up and around the corner pretty yeah so as I'm doing that I'm I'm down pretty low here", "start": 497.039, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "and now I've got to push my left side kind of up and around and Elevate the handle as I unload into it it's a good way to feel", "start": 504.84, "duration": 18.901000000000003}

{"chunk": "guys have heard at home like a good practice for like short game and chipping is to practice hitting little chips off the edge of the green so assuming your super is okay with it but", "start": 610.62, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "that's a really good practice because you learn not to dig so much into the turf yeah you learn to land the golf club Morgan wants to hurt a green like", "start": 620.1, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "that no so it's a real nice way to sort of learn that more of a sweeping bottom of the arc so you get that wide bottom of the arc and the way that that angle", "start": 627.959, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "of attack is created again is with the right wrist angle and then that club comes in a little delofted because of", "start": 637.86, "duration": 15.661000000000001}
