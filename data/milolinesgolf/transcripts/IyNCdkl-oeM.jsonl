{"chunk": "all right milo today we're going to be talking about how to synergize your downswing with the calm center of mass back", "start": 0.0, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "and the lead side out of the way [Music] so let's let's get into this we're getting fancy with the wording on this", "start": 8.16, "duration": 17.658}
{"chunk": "channel yes synergize your energy that's a good word what is what does that mean what is energy i think it's like working together working together", "start": 18.8, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "okay correlating i don't know what you want to use you have some fancy words well everyone talks about connection right in the golf", "start": 27.68, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "swing and making sure things are are moving together working together we don't want things getting trapped behind we don't want things throwing out right", "start": 35.12, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "i hate the idea of connection but i do like the idea of synergy so let's let's go with that yeah you're more of a sling guy we'd like to see yeah i like i don't want to", "start": 43.6, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "feel connected that's like yeah connected no thanks yeah okay so what does that mean first of all what", "start": 51.76, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "does it mean to get the center of mass back right so the club head we've had several videos about this", "start": 59.84, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "about we talk about hand path right so our hand path isn't actually necessarily where our hands get way deep behind us a lot of people try to shallow it that way", "start": 68.4, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "yeah that's right i was gonna just order that they get the arms down a lot right now that can be a match-up for certain grips yeah", "start": 78.64, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "it's a match-up it's not our preference you know but you can play really good like that there's plenty of guys who do have a lot of this in their golf swing and", "start": 87.6, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "match it up not my preference i want i want a baseball swing the center of mass which is kind of", "start": 97.2, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "right in right there we don't want that to be going this way early we want to make sure it is going", "start": 104.799, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "back and kind of getting in line with the direction my body is slinging energy so more or less it's sort of if you're in your correct", "start": 112.399, "duration": 17.282}
{"chunk": "posture yep it's more or less cutting you in half in the downswing yeah right bisecting you it's cutting it might be a", "start": 121.6, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "little steeper than that but yeah you know if we're coming down and cutting our necks off which we see a lot yeah like most of the time", "start": 128.8, "duration": 18.878}
{"chunk": "then the center of mass is not getting back and we got some issues with rotation and flipping probably and tilts are gonna have to get you know if this", "start": 138.239, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "club's coming down like this then i'm gonna have to do some things with my my bins i mean if you thought of if you", "start": 146.8, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "were playing t-ball or baseball right most of you would know to swing the bat like this right", "start": 154.56, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "yep and that bat more or less is cutting my upper center in half yes yes", "start": 163.76, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "i wouldn't swing the bat this way or vice versa i wouldn't swing it that way we should actually clip in a little post that i did", "start": 171.12, "duration": 20.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "of me and josh donaldson i flipped us both so our torso have you seen that one i think so yeah okay we'll have to find it but me and josh donaldson are on the", "start": 181.28, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "same inclination so i i stood me up to vertical and i put him at vertical and you can see that my golf club and his bat are working exactly it's", "start": 191.599, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "identical i think there was a post you put up too with cameron champ where you did something similar right i can't remember that was really old yep yeah those are", "start": 200.319, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "we'll find a couple posts that we can throw in here yeah so those will show that the center of mass is working back so it's in basically right here cutting", "start": 209.12, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "you in half and then you're using your turn like this yeah okay so lead side out of the way so let's talk about that so now", "start": 217.2, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "we've swung the club up the center of mass has fallen where we need it so it's lined up so if i stood up you can see that's cutting me in half", "start": 226.72, "duration": 17.598999999999997}
{"chunk": "now how do i deliver that to the ball do i go like this sure if you wanted to go that way into the desert yeah", "start": 234.959, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "or i could just get the front side out of the way yep so that mic that's in your left pocket", "start": 243.84, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "right there yeah i'm seeing that get all the way back to about pointing here at impact yep", "start": 253.599, "duration": 16.722}
{"chunk": "so that front left pocket is really pointing back towards me now yes and the club is still arriving from the inside", "start": 263.6, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "and that's where i think people get a little off is that we're talking about this rotational golf swing", "start": 272.32, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "and they think that they're we're always swinging left and the club's coming from the outside well that would be getting that that", "start": 279.84, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "would be getting kind of top heavy sequencing the top in this way and not allowing your rib cage to have any bends yeah so", "start": 287.199, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "if what you just demonstrated there your right shoulder came in high it's not symmetrical when i turned back i've got this symmetry here well as i", "start": 296.16, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "unwind i want it to match up on the other side and the column also is getting it's getting out well it has to if if", "start": 305.36, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "i'm here like this and i spin my top half yeah that's going to go out and then i'm going to do some crazy", "start": 313.759, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "stuff coming down to save it yeah and nothing good is going to happen because there's a couple of ways to kick it out right we can", "start": 322.08, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "throw so right arm probably overextend overextends a little early and then or we're throwing the wrist usually those two go together", "start": 331.68, "duration": 19.038}
{"chunk": "right or like you said you get the right shoulder kind of high and out yes so either way if you can just think", "start": 341.199, "duration": 16.242}
{"chunk": "about okay i've gotten this club in this position where my wrist is bent", "start": 349.52, "duration": 15.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "back center mass is back behind me and figure out how to turn into the ball with that staying back just staying back back back back back back back now it's", "start": 356.08, "duration": 18.318}
{"chunk": "going to deliver from the inside and how to you got to force yourself to turn out away yeah so that's the key match up we really promote on this channel if you've", "start": 365.759, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "watched our other videos you know that right wrist really matches up with us getting around the right the way that this right wrist and forearm functions", "start": 374.319, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "is what gets this club where we want it and gets the face alignments how we want it so i could get the center mass back and flop my wrist", "start": 383.759, "duration": 18.162}
{"chunk": "funny and now i'm i'm really dead you didn't open the doorknob the right way or i could get it like this flopped under", "start": 392.56, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "hit it with the back part of the golf club that's nice turn this way hit it with the face so", "start": 401.52, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "it's important how this forearm and wrist works that's what gets the center mass back then it's also important how our pivoting motion is symmetrical so we", "start": 409.28, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "want to make sure that the pelvis is what's starting this motion and that we're allowing our body", "start": 418.0, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "to turn and bend properly without doing any of this kind of stuff so i can turn and bend and i'm still standing my my", "start": 425.68, "duration": 20.161}
{"chunk": "ribs are on top of my hips versus my hips over there somewhere in my rib cage on top of my back foot", "start": 437.759, "duration": 16.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "and now i'm crying my hips my back hurts so the way we get our lead side out of the way is pretty important we want to make sure", "start": 445.68, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "it's not only my hips yeah it's my it's everything the pelvis is leading", "start": 453.84, "duration": 17.358}
{"chunk": "it's pulling me around the corner but what else has gotten out of the way the whole left side has turned the corner right yeah", "start": 462.319, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "it can't just be well even your lead your shoulder your lead shoulder is it going a little up yes but it's up on the plane it's a round and that's", "start": 471.36, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "it's all about this symmetrical motion yeah we don't want to see really really steep now yeah and we also don't want to see", "start": 480.24, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "now it's went two around and this one went two out so we have to figure out how to make our bodies pivot with symmetry if we can have symmetrical motion", "start": 490.879, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "it's simple yeah and that combat that happens not just because we're holding angles but because because that lead side gets", "start": 499.36, "duration": 17.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "out of the way that pivot gets it staying back as long as we're not pulling or throwing it's just like that toe move you always", "start": 508.24, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "talk about well for me it all goes back to just swinging a stick like i grew up a baseball bat i would never ever", "start": 516.56, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "take the center of mass of the baseball bat which is the barrel yeah and go this way it always", "start": 524.72, "duration": 15.680000000000001}
{"chunk": "would go back so it's lined up to cut me in half like this boom and then delivers out into the ball golf is the same yep pretty much so", "start": 532.16, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "here's a little drill i do sometimes especially with driver actually because even driver especially we want to feel like it's", "start": 542.0, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "a little bit more of that around motion right so one exercise i'll do with people is have them actually make some little baseball swings", "start": 550.32, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "where they get that center mask back to the right they turn turn turn turn turn and then sling it off around", "start": 558.48, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "and then they figure that out and then they get in here and all they've really changed is their posture to get down to the golf ball and make", "start": 567.92, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "that same move where that club more or less is cutting them in half right so i might even start here so it's cutting me in", "start": 577.36, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "half get in my my bend here to get down to the ball and chip one out", "start": 586.16, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "it's perfect that's a fun little exercise you can do the ball yeah so if you struggle if the club", "start": 594.24, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
{"chunk": "wants to pitch out that's a good place to start get the center of mass where you want it deliver start with it level because", "start": 608.959, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "you'll you'll feel oh shoot that's not that feels really stupid why would i want to do this well you could you could seriously like you could even put this club on a table", "start": 617.519, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "and get it to your right with your hinge turn and then get it back on the table with your turn yeah now the club's going to", "start": 626.8, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "move a little closer to you just a little because of this hinge so that's where you got to figure out how am i going to get down to the golf ball that's why we have a little bit of", "start": 634.64, "duration": 18.078000000000003}
{"chunk": "that that down as well that's why we add a little hip flex a little knee flex and a little flex and spine everything is kind of compressing to the ground so we", "start": 643.519, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "can accommodate that yeah in the strike all right guys so get that calm back back back back back back", "start": 652.88, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "and then clear the lead side for those home runs right yeah you hit some bombs and compress those irons nicely so that's a key match up we talk about a", "start": 661.12, "duration": 17.279}
