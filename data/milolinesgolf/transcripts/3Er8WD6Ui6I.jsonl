{"chunk": "their body is striding but their hands are staying where they started what's that doing for the player well it creates some stretches so because my", "start": 49.719, "duration": 17.522000000000002}
{"chunk": "hands are staying back here I'm actually creating a big stretch in this shoulder in this lat so it's creating some stretches that's why it's so important", "start": 58.32, "duration": 17.718999999999998}

{"chunk": "staying up and back in transition doing that stretch you're talking about yeah right now this relates to a video we just put out recently on turning into", "start": 126.84, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "your left arm video you did yep sort of like in frisbee right so as we're throwing a frisbee we're counteracting", "start": 136.56, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "this frisbee going back with our body going around and to the left so I can slingshot this thing for sure that creates the nice stretch sort and cycle", "start": 144.8, "duration": 16.84}

{"chunk": "behind us cuz now as I change directions this right arm is a little too far behind me and I'm kind of Trapped so one", "start": 187.879, "duration": 15.602}
{"chunk": "thing we see a lot is in the takeaway people are trying to get that left arm sort of pinned across them a straight left arm they want to keep it", "start": 196.0, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "straight or locked out now you have an inside takeaway the hands get deep and yeah you have a lot of depth but you better believe the first thing you're", "start": 204.599, "duration": 18.439}
{"chunk": "going to do is get rid of that yeah so what that tells us is that that player is driving their back swing with their arms not with their pivot right so if", "start": 213.519, "duration": 19.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "your arms are getting across you early it's cuz you're using them to create the back swing versus using your chest to", "start": 223.879, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "create the back swing so we want to use our our middle our torso to create both backswing and downswing that way we can", "start": 231.879, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "walk away from our hands correctly and you all you'll almost see them kind of retracting this arm it's kind of pulling up across them just like day-to-day", "start": 239.84, "duration": 15.878}
{"chunk": "activities we talk about a lot sort of pulling in and then the down swing pushing it back out yeah right so if we can keep that wide and turn our sternum", "start": 247.959, "duration": 20.162}
{"chunk": "now when we have the hands more in front of us still when we transition now the left arm can move into us a little bit yep", "start": 257.88, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "it's an opposite Loop almost exactly we've dialed in that we've seen in other sports this motion how are we going to add it to the golf swing well there's", "start": 266.0, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "some easy ways I really like step drills we've talked about step drills how as I swing this club back I can actually be", "start": 275.84, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "striding the opposite way of where the club is going I wasn't going to hit you there or skating or skating but yeah so I like step drills I also like anything", "start": 283.84, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "that has some momentum so I feel like I'm just creating some momentum in my body toss the club and then as the club", "start": 293.32, "duration": 16.079}

{"chunk": "and left what do you think about like freezer drills cuz some people like to kind of get it up there so they can feel it there and then go I don't mind", "start": 318.0, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "freezer drills if they're done correctly so if you swing it up we freeze but then we give it a little an extra pump a", "start": 326.84, "duration": 17.319}
{"chunk": "little just a little start up to get the energy going then a freezer is really can be good cuz you can feel structure and where you're trying to get to but to", "start": 335.44, "duration": 19.360000000000003}
{"chunk": "swing up freeze and go like this yeah I'm not a huge fan of that so CU then it things can start going too much together or this could actually be leading the", "start": 344.319, "duration": 17.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "race it could so that little pump you did actually puts flow back in the system right okay okay so let's watch you do a little let's do that little", "start": 353.88, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "step drill from face on okay all right so Milo let's do one little feel before you do this step drill just to kind of give our viewers at home a sense of what", "start": 362.4, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "that should feel like in transition so why don't you go ahead and put your hands together okay and now we're going to turn our sternum all the way to the top so you're not going to pull These", "start": 371.599, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "Arms across you like we talked about right so you're going to turn them up to the top now we're going to keep going we'll let the right arm fold a little bit so now we've made a nice back swing", "start": 380.639, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "right mhm I'm going to put my hand in here and I want you to sort of start your down swing so kind of land in the the left side so you can feel those", "start": 388.919, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "hands staying up and back and you're getting that stretch across yeah your lead arm right for sure it feels like everything's stretching back that way", "start": 397.24, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "okay so now let's do it one more time we're going to add a step to it and then a step okay another one now we're going to go hit a golf ball with that same", "start": 405.52, "duration": 18.479000000000003}
{"chunk": "feeling I'm I'm assuming this is kind of the feel you're talking about right yeah pretty much so you want me to", "start": 414.24, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "do my step okay that was the first swing in about a week I hit it a little hard well we stretched you", "start": 421.759, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "[Music] out all right M so that's a that's a cool feel sort of leaving the hands up", "start": 436.23, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "as we're going back the other way so when you do these step drills don't just get everything going together it's not like that we're actually creating we're", "start": 450.72, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "counteracting it aren't we creating that flow that we talk about so often there's opposing motion so as one thing's going forward the other thing still going back", "start": 459.4, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "that way we stay balanced out and that width is so key too to kind of creating that shallower downswing so for many of you that are getting steep in transition", "start": 468.28, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "you're pulling as you're starting to get into your left side which you probably are doing too late as well that's probably the real problem is that they're not getting left soon enough so", "start": 478.12, "duration": 18.639999999999997}
{"chunk": "that when they change directions it all it all looks like it spins and pulls down like I'm creating this stretch right here", "start": 487.36, "duration": 16.719}
