{"chunk": "i would like to talk about one of the most important fundamentals in the golf swing and what that is it's the way we move our hips and pelvis through the", "start": 0.0, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "shot and how we use our feet on the ground to to move our hips and pelvis now first thing i want to talk about is", "start": 7.6, "duration": 16.238}
{"chunk": "a couple of the the faults i see that are most common so i understand why you do these things", "start": 15.759, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "we've all seen the images of top tour professionals and how they look at impact they've got their hips and their pelvis way open the trick is", "start": 23.519, "duration": 20.322}
{"chunk": "how do they get there i want to show you that the main faults i see and then we're going to talk about what we actually need to try to do", "start": 33.6, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "so first thing i see is because we see those images of the pros with their their hips open and the pressure up in their their front foot i see people", "start": 42.0, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "trying to fire off of their their trail foot and rotate now this causes a few", "start": 51.36, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "problems first when i fire forward like this i've now taken all the weight pressure off of my trail", "start": 59.039, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "foot so it's basically not helping me anymore it can't do anything and the other issue i've run into is i've taken my left hip and i've", "start": 66.72, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "shoved it up where it's forward of my left ankle so now when i use the ground all it creates is a jumping up motion", "start": 76.08, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "so rather than getting rotation all i'm getting is pushing forward tilting my body and jumping", "start": 84.4, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "which causes some real problems with what the club does when i push forward like this my spine gets tilted away which sends the club back on too shallow the", "start": 92.64, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "plane behind me and because there's no ability to rotate i'm now stuck so now i'm going to do it all with my hands and the ball is going to go a lot of different directions", "start": 101.92, "duration": 18.558}
{"chunk": "okay the second way i see people screw this up is you know they still see those that picture of getting open so they", "start": 111.119, "duration": 15.681999999999999}
{"chunk": "try to get open by spinning their back foot so you see a lot of this right knee spinning in like this the the back ankle", "start": 119.28, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "spinning around behind that's also a killer because now you're not putting any pressure into the ground you're just spinning so you're not able to create any force", "start": 126.96, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "and there's no stability in the way you swing the golf club so with both of these methods in an effort to get everything opened up", "start": 136.4, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "you actually wind up with a lot less turn than you would had you used the ground correctly so now let's talk about what actually needs to", "start": 144.72, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "happen to get your your hips to rotate so first thing we need to understand is what causes our hips to rotate", "start": 152.64, "duration": 15.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "and there's a series of hip rotator muscles that run between the the side of our hip here and back somewhere in the in the back in", "start": 160.8, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "our glute that as we turn this way are stretched so those muscles get elongated", "start": 169.2, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "very similar to how when i bend my elbow like this my tricep muscle gets elongated now if i want to straighten it out i just contract it", "start": 176.56, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "so those muscles get elongated and then as i go to swing and i want my hips to turn those muscles", "start": 184.48, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "contract now what they do is they turn my femur clockwise now if i've got", "start": 194.159, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "enough weight load in my right foot my foot's not going to spin there'll be less resistance in my hips so my hips will open up", "start": 201.519, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "very similar to how a gear and a clock works you know one gear will be spinning this way and the the other gear will spin the other way because they're meeting so", "start": 211.2, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "because there's weight resistance in this right foot and none in my my pelvis it opens up", "start": 220.4, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "so that's the the first thing we need to understand is how we use those muscles now i'm going to give you a couple of exercises that will teach you", "start": 229.76, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "which muscles you're actually using because you'll be able to feel it and what the feeling is with your foot okay so first exercise i'm going to put", "start": 238.08, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "a club out in front of me like this lift my leg like a pitcher now i'm going to turn back so now i've stretched the muscles in my hip now i'm going to turn open", "start": 245.28, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "and i'll do it i'll do it over and over again if i do it enough i'll begin to feel those muscles", "start": 254.879, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "starting to fatigue i already start to feel them they're not muscles that we use that next exercise i like i like to get something like cardboard", "start": 262.8, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "or a frisbee or something and stand on it and practice going into a backswing and loading and then making my transition", "start": 273.199, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "and if i do that because it's slippery now there's no i can't wait load my foot will just spin so if i'm using the muscles correctly", "start": 282.72, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "i just get a spin on my my back foot so now that we understand what our trail leg is doing now we need to understand what our lead leg needs to do", "start": 290.8, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "to allow our hips to open up so our trail leg is rotating clockwise which is sending our our hips turning", "start": 300.08, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "counterclockwise and at the same time we need to allow our lead leg to go into external rotation", "start": 309.44, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "for the first part of the downswing which is going to allow our pelvis to begin to open up and so we're going to get all the way back by the time we get down to p5 we're", "start": 317.84, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "going to be back where our knees are back level and we're going to be close to centered pressure wise between our", "start": 326.32, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "feet okay so your your weight pressure doesn't all just jump off of your back foot right away now", "start": 334.72, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "from the time we reach down in here to p5 moving into p6 now that club is starting to move out and down so what begins to happen is we", "start": 342.88, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "begin to push away with our left leg so we've got everything to hear and we push away with our left leg and that sends our hips", "start": 352.479, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "spinning so then we open right up and you can see clearly that as i'm rotating or as i'm", "start": 360.639, "duration": 19.842}
{"chunk": "moving pressure i'm also rotating so that's the key so again to reiterate how this works first thing we swing up to the top we've got 80", "start": 370.56, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "percent of our pressure more or less in our trail foot and as we transition the pressure increases slightly so you're not firing", "start": 381.759, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "off and getting all your weight over on your left foot really early in your downswing so the pressure increases and the muscles in our", "start": 389.759, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "our rotating muscles in our hip rotate our our right leg clockwise which opens our hips up", "start": 397.52, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "and our left leg opens up the hip and then pushes away down into the ball so there's really no", "start": 405.44, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "firing laterally or attempting to spin it all happens because of the way we're using the ground and the way our muscles are designed and if you do it correctly", "start": 412.8, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "you'll see that as i begin to turn my right hip doesn't move forward at all as i begin to turn", "start": 422.639, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "what happens is because that right leg's turning it actually turns my left hip and makes it come back so that the the line that would be drawn on my rear end", "start": 430.96, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "both of them are on it when i get back down to to square to the target line again", "start": 440.72, "duration": 13.920000000000002}
