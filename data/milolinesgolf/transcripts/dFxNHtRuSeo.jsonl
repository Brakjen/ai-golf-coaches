{"chunk": "especially we can hit it straight now let's talk about the dynamics of what it takes to hit it farther than what you currently do well number one on my", "start": 26.779, "duration": 16.750999999999998}
{"chunk": "agenda is to get you hitting it as solid as possible and that's why we talk about a lot of the technical things that I've talked about in in previous videos", "start": 35.82, "duration": 16.009999999999998}
