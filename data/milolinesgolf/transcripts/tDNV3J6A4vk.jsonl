{"chunk": "let's talk about how we set our feet so we can swing like an athlete [Music]", "start": 0.24, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "so in this video i want to talk to you guys a little bit about how our setup can affect the way we swing and what the greatest of all time have", "start": 10.16, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "done to be able to swing in an athletic way so first thing i've got here i've got a little square so you can get an idea of ball", "start": 17.6, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "position i just wanted to walk you through some ball position with each golf club so if as i'm swinging a sand wedge like i have here", "start": 27.119, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "i'm going to first thing i always do is i like to set my face and then i usually come in i set my face with my", "start": 34.719, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "right foot and then i set my left foot where i want it and for me my left foot is going to be just forward", "start": 42.879, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "about a club head width from the orange line and then here i'm going to widen my stance out so now you can see that ball", "start": 49.92, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
{"chunk": "is probably just slightly forward of center with a sand wedge for me and i also like to have a slightly open stance you won't be able to see it as good from this angle we'll flip around in a minute", "start": 58.399, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "and show you from down the line what that looks like but my stance is just slightly open balls just forward of center when i'm hitting a sand wedge", "start": 67.439, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "the other thing to note is what my toes or my foot flare looks like my left foot is slightly turned out my right foot is probably also slightly", "start": 76.56, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "turned out but not quite as much let's grab a seven iron so i go through the exact same process here with seven iron i like to set my", "start": 85.28, "duration": 16.718}
{"chunk": "club face my with my right foot forward and then place my left foot where i want it okay it's back in the exact same foot hole okay", "start": 94.64, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "and then my i drop my right foot back a little bit and now my stance is a hair wider you can see that ball position is now", "start": 103.6, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "looks to be a hair forward in my stance relative what the sand wedge looked like and at this point my stance also is pretty much dead square to my target", "start": 111.36, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "line now that can vary based on your preference our stance line is not necessarily the most important thing we'll show you more", "start": 119.92, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "from down the line in a second but the thing to note is my feet are not perfectly square and throughout history we'll show you a", "start": 128.399, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "picture of some of the greatest players of all time and you won't see any of them with their feet set dead square like this they generally start with their their", "start": 136.0, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "toes just slightly flared and then as they go into motion that might change somewhat because a lot of them lifted their heel and maybe replanted more back square but", "start": 150.16, "duration": 17.839999999999996}
{"chunk": "they didn't start there okay now let's go to driver get it on a tee we'll go through the same process here", "start": 158.959, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "so set the club face now i'm going to set my left foot with driver my left foot is going to basically stand on top of the orange", "start": 171.04, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "stick and then i drop my right foot back that puts this ball more up in line with my left shoulder okay", "start": 181.44, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "so if that was there i would be basically almost standing on the orange stick instead of having my foot out here more in front", "start": 189.68, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "and if you're looking at my my stance line is actually now slightly closed and i learned this from reading the books of some of the greats", "start": 199.04, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "like jack nicklaus has a diagram in his book golf my way and also ben hogan has an awesome diagram we'll throw one of those into this video so you can see", "start": 207.44, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "what the greatest players how they how they kind of saw where their feet go okay let's flip this over and now i'm going to set the same thing up so we're", "start": 216.64, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "going to be now uh down the line so let's go back to the sand wedge", "start": 224.48, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "so here i'm going to show you from from down the line what it looks like when i set up with a sand wedge so again i set the face in my right foot now i'm going", "start": 233.76, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "to place my left foot where i want it and drop my right foot to where i want it and you can see my feet are not exactly parallel", "start": 240.959, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "to that aim line they're actually aimed a little to the left my heel line is probably a little closer but because my feet are flared slightly", "start": 249.84, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "my toe line looks like it's aimed left okay now what's really important here is my my chest line is pretty close to square so", "start": 259.04, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "as i address this ball my chest is going to be fairly square and hopefully my eyes are fairly square if i start to get set up like this the odds are pretty good that i'm going", "start": 267.199, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "to hit from the outside so we're going to really feel chest square feet a little open that promotes me being able to get open and get around on this shot so let's hit a", "start": 275.84, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "little chip shot here a little little wedge okay so i went pretty much down my line that i'm looking at", "start": 285.04, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "now as i move out to a longer golf club like a 7-iron let's see what changes", "start": 294.479, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "so again i set the face place my left foot where i want it now drop my right foot now you'll see that my stance looks pretty close to", "start": 302.8, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "square to that stick on the ground and that feels pretty good for aiming where i want to hit it", "start": 311.44, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "and again my eye line is fairly square my chest line is fairly square now my foot line is pretty square we'll hit one out there", "start": 319.039, "duration": 18.25}
{"chunk": "[Music] oh i hit that so bad but it went straight okay here we are with our last ball", "start": 328.17, "duration": 15.231000000000002}
{"chunk": "we set the face set our forward foot and you can see i stood right on top of that stick now i set my trail foot", "start": 341.36, "duration": 17.358}
{"chunk": "and so for me to hit it down that orange line or parallel to it i'm actually slightly closed at this point because the club's", "start": 351.759, "duration": 15.202}
{"chunk": "a little longer okay so this promotes me being able to make my path fairly neutral even though i'm going to hit up because if i aim square", "start": 358.72, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "and i hit up my path has shifted pretty good to the left going to make the ball cut a lot okay so again we set the face", "start": 369.28, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "set our front foot set our back foot where we want it and with driver it's going to be a little wider and again my feet are slightly flared", "start": 378.0, "duration": 19.279}
{"chunk": "stance is just slightly closed okay so here we go let's see if we can hit a nice drive there we go nice drive down the line", "start": 387.36, "duration": 15.521999999999998}
{"chunk": "almost like i knew what i was doing so again where we align our feet is not really as important as", "start": 402.24, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "how our bodies aligned or in our eyes we have great examples throughout history of players that set up with open stances and closed", "start": 410.0, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "stances yet we're still very successful hitting the ball at their target some examples of that would be blitravino he tended to aim", "start": 419.12, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "pretty open here and then dropped it in and hit the ball down the line sam's snead was closed some amount like this", "start": 427.44, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "and in today's game matt kucher sets up pretty darn closed while other players like rory mcelroy hits high draws out of an open stance", "start": 437.199, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "so where your feet are doesn't necessarily matter that much what matters is that can you path the club how you want to", "start": 445.84, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "what your feet do can help though so if you struggle with certain things adjusting our setup can help so again we don't want to set our feet dead", "start": 453.68, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "square we want to go ahead and let them naturally have a little bit of flare and then based on the golf club our stance will", "start": 462.88, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "widen and narrow or widen or narrow and it could open or close based on what we're swinging so i hope that helps", "start": 469.68, "duration": 15.52}
