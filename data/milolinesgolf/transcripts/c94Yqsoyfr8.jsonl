{"chunk": "swing Barry Bonds now I want to show you kind of how a golf swing compares to a baseball swing and how pressure is moved", "start": 44.23, "duration": 16.78}
{"chunk": "back and forth from one foot to the other wasn't able to switch his swing to right-handed so I switched mine to left", "start": 53.8, "duration": 16.649}
{"chunk": "so we can see the comparison so let's move me up a little closer to the top of my backswing okay you can see as I reach", "start": 60.969, "duration": 21.392000000000003}
{"chunk": "the top I've got my lead heel just coming up off the ground so obviously the majority the pressure in my golf", "start": 71.8, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "swing is in my trail foot now here's Barry Bonds as he's getting ready to to go he's got his front foot in the air so", "start": 79.45, "duration": 18.511}
{"chunk": "there was no pressure in that foot and his hands are working back so that's kind of equivalent of the backswing", "start": 89.95, "duration": 15.318999999999999}
{"chunk": "so his front foots in the air hands are working back and his front foot it's just about to land his toe is on the", "start": 97.17, "duration": 18.58}

{"chunk": "athletic motion it's really hard to start momentum toward the target until you have something to brace against so you'll see the same idea here with my", "start": 134.14, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "swing my hands are moving away for the last few frames and now you can see I'm planted my heel down so about", "start": 143.56, "duration": 17.660999999999998}
{"chunk": "the time I plant my heel down you can see my belt buckle start to rotate and", "start": 152.03, "duration": 15.61}
{"chunk": "my hands start to move target word so you kind of see a similar launch position so he's got his his foot down", "start": 159.91, "duration": 20.990000000000002}
{"chunk": "and he's starting to launch and you can see in a golf swing you can see kind of the same position there my trail elbow", "start": 171.14, "duration": 20.329}
{"chunk": "is kind of going under my lead arm and my pelvis is starting to rotate and in order to do that you've got to start to", "start": 180.29, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "put pressure here into the the lead foot so that's part of what is able to create the rotation as you begin to put", "start": 189.23, "duration": 16.299}
{"chunk": "pressure into the lead foot you can begin to open up now as the magnitude of the pressure increases you're continuing", "start": 197.329, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "to open you don't move pressure over there without rotating and you can see", "start": 205.22, "duration": 15.469999999999999}
{"chunk": "the more pressure I build the more I'm rotating and the same idea here with", "start": 211.75, "duration": 15.43}
{"chunk": "with Barry you can see as he swings that that pressure is getting stronger in that lead foot and the way I can tell that is you watch what his head and his", "start": 220.4, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "body's doing as it keeps swinging and his head starts to push back so the faster that bat goes the more he's rotating the more pressure he's putting", "start": 229.489, "duration": 16.821}
{"chunk": "into his lead foot and he's backing up and you'll see the exact same thing if you reference that tree in the background and watch what my head is", "start": 237.92, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "doing it backing up so I'm as the club's coming down and putting more and more pressure into the ground and you can see some pretty good similarities there", "start": 246.38, "duration": 20.669}
{"chunk": "between him and impact and my golf swing of impact now there the way you're using", "start": 255.95, "duration": 16.591}
{"chunk": "the ground the way the spine and the lead leg are kind of almost lined up you can really see it right there how is his", "start": 264.8, "duration": 18.06}
{"chunk": "front leg and his spine are basically making a line this way and you can see as I go through this", "start": 274.07, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "shot how it's kind of the same look and then what's interesting here is you're", "start": 281.919, "duration": 15.159}
{"chunk": "pushing away and there's not a whole lot of pressure in the trail foot and now you'll see his trail foot just went down and now the pressure shifted back into", "start": 291.219, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "his back foot and that kind of same thing happens there with me you can see pressure just went up in my back foot so", "start": 299.319, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "again in order to create athletic motion you know there's a nice load into the", "start": 308.56, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "trail foot so there's the load obviously all the pressures on that trail foot because the leat ones off the ground and", "start": 313.93, "duration": 20.121}
{"chunk": "then the pressure shifts but you can see his weights really not moving very much he hasn't moved his head's not moving forward his torso is not moving forward", "start": 326.25, "duration": 15.4}
{"chunk": "and you can see the same thing here with my golf swing that my head's not moving forward my torso is not moving forward but the pressure definitely moved up", "start": 334.27, "duration": 18.598}
{"chunk": "into that forward foot as I went into transition and you can see the rotation starts right away as well my hips start", "start": 343.449, "duration": 16.472}
{"chunk": "to rotate before my my handle of my club starts to move down and the hips don't really start to rotate and tell there's", "start": 351.46, "duration": 18.868000000000002}
{"chunk": "a start of pressure in the front foot because it's really hard to turn with one foot dangling in the air", "start": 360.759, "duration": 16.971}
{"chunk": "now one thing to keep in mind the more pressure you can put into the ground the more speed you can make so that's why", "start": 369.36, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "it's really important to have that transition move where you're sitting into the ground so your reflex in your legs so that you can really push off out", "start": 378.879, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "of the ground and create it's kind of like creating the popping of the towel you have to be able to push away as the club comes down that makes that club", "start": 388.719, "duration": 18.57}
{"chunk": "snap around just like that his baseball bat you can really see as he's baseball bats going forward he's pushing backward and you can see the same thing happening", "start": 397.719, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "there with that golf club so hope this helps you", "start": 407.169, "duration": 9.659}
