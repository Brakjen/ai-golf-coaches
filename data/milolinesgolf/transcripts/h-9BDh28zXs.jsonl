{"chunk": "hey everybody welcome back out to superstition mountain it's my favorite week of the year this is almost as good as christmas masters week and so we've got a treat", "start": 0.48, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "for you we're going to talk about a few different scenarios that the players at the masters are going to face", "start": 9.28, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "[Music] first one is this one we're in a fairway bunker at the masters generally you see people", "start": 17.48, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "hitting it in bunkers off of there's a nice one on one nice one on two nice one on eight there's a few a few", "start": 27.199, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "key bunkers where people are gonna hit it in uh 18 18. see a lot of people in those those two bunkers up the left side so there's some nice bunkers there and those those bunkers", "start": 35.52, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "are generally significantly higher lip than this one yeah although this is you know it's a fairly steep lip", "start": 44.239, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "so let's just kind of walk through some of the basics of hitting a bunker shot now we've created a few different scenarios here we've got", "start": 51.44, "duration": 19.279}
{"chunk": "one ball that's a really nice lie fairly far away from the lip we've got one that's in a groove so a rake mark", "start": 60.559, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "which that's going to happen at some point right and then we've got these two that are up a lot closer to the lip with decent lies but you know it changes the shot a little bit", "start": 69.2, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "yep cool so henry let's kind of walk us through what's your process here well what's interesting is that you and i actually didn't even discuss what we were going to talk", "start": 77.36, "duration": 16.959999999999997}
{"chunk": "about nope in this video so the beauty of this and in fairway bunkers and sort of specialty shots is some people have sort of differing", "start": 86.0, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "ideas or ways they do it but it can work right yeah all that matters is can you hit the ball solid right that's the contact is", "start": 94.079, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "crucial here for me the first thing is always observing the lip and if there is an issue with the lip picking a club that even if it doesn't", "start": 101.6, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "get to the green it's always getting over this lip comfortably yeah right taking the trouble out of play because leaving in this bunker", "start": 111.84, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "that's no bueno my number one rule when i was in college my coach said if you're in trouble get out yup so if we're in the bunker we don't want", "start": 119.04, "duration": 17.200999999999997}
{"chunk": "to be hitting a bunker shot the next shot right so now these two just from observation like you know we're about 155 pin", "start": 128.64, "duration": 19.118}
{"chunk": "i got a little wind behind me but you know with me hitting pitching wedge or nine iron here i'm really not in any trouble hitting that lip unless i", "start": 137.599, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "really sculled it or something crazy like that so yeah for sure you're not the lips really not in play from here right so for me", "start": 145.84, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "i want to get in here comfortably um i usually put it just a little bit back in my stance because i really want that ball first contact", "start": 153.92, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "i like digging my feet in just a little bit and i like to feel kind of tall and feeling like i swing around myself because i want a shallow", "start": 163.36, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "angle of attack i don't like getting too steep so those are kind of maybe a couple of fields i work on with the ball back i might open my", "start": 172.319, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "stance a little bit just to offset that path as well okay pretty similar to what i do i generally i don't dig in a ton but i'll dig in", "start": 180.959, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "just enough so i have a nice base yeah just so i'm not like sliding all over the place or anything and then i'll grip down on the golf club just a tiny bit", "start": 188.879, "duration": 16.721000000000004}
{"chunk": "yep i like to hover the club kind of middle of the ball interesting yeah so i'm just helping me with my radius so i", "start": 196.48, "duration": 15.279000000000002}
{"chunk": "don't get it all the way down to the bottom of the ball i'm hovering it kind of middle yep and if i hit if i miss anywhere i generally miss slightly thin", "start": 205.12, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "yeah and i try to feel like when i hit these shots it's kind of a little bit more of a top heavy swing i'm not going to get into the ground and use", "start": 212.56, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "all the force that i do to produce speed it's more of kind of a level upper body centric swing i'm not using", "start": 221.28, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "the legs a lot now if you're let's say your pitching wedge goes 155 which we're about here the pin are you hitting pitching wedge", "start": 229.28, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "are you maybe taking one extra club what's your kind of philosophy there i'm generally about a half a club i add a half a club to it so i figure if", "start": 237.28, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "it would normally be a solid pitching wedge for me i'd probably hit just a smooth nine that's kind of where i would where i would stand on this because i'm", "start": 245.92, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "not going to be able to hit it quite as aggressively yeah for me because i use the ground a lot yeah i don't my swing is not a lot of", "start": 254.56, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "arms and upper body it's mostly legs and middle of my body yeah so that's going to get taken away somewhat here so", "start": 263.44, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "i add a club okay yeah and for me with us being you know pretty warm out got a little wind behind us i'm going to try and hit pitching wedge there it might come up a", "start": 271.04, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "tad bit short but it's not a terrible miss so okay let's see what you got yeah if i get behind here i still pick out even a spot", "start": 279.36, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "right in front of me that just helps me get lined up grip down a touch", "start": 287.44, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "pull back my stance and he made pretty darn perfect contact might be just a touch short well i got there it's right on the front", "start": 293.68, "duration": 17.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "of the green just short of the pin and usually out of these lies it tends to cut just a little bit just because for me i like the feeling of um you know", "start": 310.4, "duration": 17.998}
{"chunk": "getting that ball first so with the handle being forward i tend to swing maybe just a little more left to have the face a little open but", "start": 319.919, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "i'd say that's pretty common yep then we got this nasty lie here so this one is it's a little sketchy", "start": 327.44, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "yeah so for me and it's also a little bit above my feet which makes it even harder because now it's gonna the tendency is gonna be to clip the sand a little before the ball", "start": 335.36, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "right so for me on this shot yeah this is a tough one so i probably grip down a little bit more i may even take nine iron here but i'm gonna hit", "start": 344.72, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "pitching wedge just to see what happens so i'll have it a little back to my stance i'm gonna imagine the ball flight's probably gonna come out a little lower", "start": 353.68, "duration": 20.48}
{"chunk": "out of this lie but all else is pretty much the same i just want that good contact so i get", "start": 362.24, "duration": 15.918}
{"chunk": "focused on that so you can see that kind of lower cut yeah it squirted low and a little off to the right yeah it's a little right now we're in", "start": 371.039, "duration": 15.042000000000002}
{"chunk": "trouble but yeah not terrible so on that one i probably could aim to even a little more left but there's also trouble left so but you've", "start": 384.8, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "heard the sound too it's probably a groove long it did a little thin yeah it's not bad but it came out it's not in the worst spot in the world it's just", "start": 392.8, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "maybe maybe not ideal i guess i could aimed a little more left a little bit but you can still get that up and down not bad good shot so now we're a little", "start": 400.479, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "closer to the lip here the sand is pretty soft but you can see the from here the lip is about", "start": 409.68, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "almost waist high relative to where he's out here so this ball's got to come up fairly fast right but i don't think it's really it's not really in the way for the club you're hitting you've got a wedge in", "start": 419.919, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "your hand right yeah probably for this one i might be okay with pitching wedge the lie is good enough the one thing i would do um is i would", "start": 428.16, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "come on the side here i know you got to rake a little bit more but i'd come on the side and just imagine you know with a pitching wedge loft you know where is this ball going to", "start": 437.039, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "come out of all right so for example right here we could actually show people yeah kinda you know that's gonna if he hits", "start": 445.12, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "it it's gonna come out it's gonna come out just a little less high than the loft on the club so probably about 10 degrees less about like that so i mean if i hit", "start": 453.36, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "anything like the first one i hit in this sand i should be fine it's over no problem so let me hit the pitching wedge i'm gonna trust that one", "start": 462.24, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "again just a little back my stamp dig in just a little bit still feel", "start": 473.84, "duration": 21.520999999999997}
{"chunk": "somewhat tall though", "start": 478.72, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "you hit it really solid that same little cut i got a little wind on that like this yeah the wind's blowing it it's firm up there that's pretty good just on the fringe so", "start": 495.36, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "with this one let's let's actually put it a little bit closer here just to make it a little tough okay good even with the upslope let's say the lie wasn't great", "start": 504.319, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "so now you can't hit your pitching wedge because yeah it's it's it's questionable i'd have to open the face and you probably still could but yep", "start": 512.64, "duration": 19.601000000000003}
{"chunk": "it's probably not worth the risk so one of the shots i always think about when i have the lip in front of me like this is you know i mean number one we gotta get over the lip but two", "start": 522.32, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "i you know i always reflect back on like a tiger at carnoustie you remember that bunker shot he had it was sweet and he just went after it right so for me sometimes i i actually enjoy", "start": 531.2, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "taking the lesser club and if i feel committed and grounded and i can make good contact i'll go after it", "start": 540.48, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "you know i'd rather be ready set go versus any doubt in my mind right so so let's see be aggressive good", "start": 547.2, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "contact right and this might come up a little short but it's probably gonna come up five to ten short but that's okay this lie is not the best but we're gonna", "start": 556.32, "duration": 19.839}
{"chunk": "go after it when after it smoked it it's gonna be about five yards short but it's really good", "start": 565.279, "duration": 16.682}
{"chunk": "you can see i mean i took a pretty big divot it's a little upslope though but again i got in here and i'm like all right ball first contact and i i had there's a little bit of that", "start": 590.0, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "aggression versus coming in here with any bit of doubt i want that ball first contact and that that's really the key to fairway bunker shots it's just making good contact", "start": 598.399, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "we've got to hit the ball first and we've got to select the club we know we're going to get up right and a gap wedge is going to get out a lot better than a 5 iron i could tell", "start": 607.68, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "you that so yeah you can get a gap wedge out of most situations don't be afraid to come up a little short missing the right area move on you're", "start": 615.839, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "out of the bunker that's that's kind of the key here so that's it yep so hope you like this video hope you enjoy the masters this week and", "start": 624.079, "duration": 17.762}
{"chunk": "if you did like this video subscribe to the channel and come on over to milo lines golf click on the link in the in the description", "start": 633.04, "duration": 17.36}
