{"chunk": "and then you can shoot it back out all in one motion right but manage your energies beautiful like right there that's an", "start": 8.88, "duration": 16.160000000000004}
{"chunk": "even better strike than the first one let's talk about how finding the honey hole one of your turns honey hole baby can make you into a great play", "start": 16.08, "duration": 17.602}
{"chunk": "okay guys so again on your instagram i don't remember if this was on yours or luke bracky's one of you but i heard the term", "start": 30.56, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "honey hole and i saw what was demonstrated and for me it equates to some different language but let's walk through what the honey", "start": 38.96, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "hole is in the golf swing beautiful so a honey hole is traditionally speaking like p5 or delivery", "start": 46.8, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "is what honey hole is but we call it honey hole because we use we use it with a lot of our juniors so it's something that they can remember so if you go hey show me p5 they don't really register it", "start": 55.44, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "right but and i don't call i don't use the p system much once in a while just because people like that language but yeah i i say from here we're kind of", "start": 64.879, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "sitting a square yep and that's how we begin to kind of shallow the golf swing and create some pelvic depth right sure", "start": 73.68, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "sure so let's walk up to the top of the backswing and then show me what honey hole is okay perfect yeah so", "start": 83.2, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "one i think the when we're looking at honey hole you look at all these different swings on tours obviously really really high", "start": 91.04, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "level swings and you see all kinds of differences right from like matt wolf in the backswing compared to adam scott they look very different", "start": 99.28, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "even at impact at times we'll see differences right the golf club will be in different positions right like you see a guy like neem in the golf clubs you weigh like super low the grip is low", "start": 107.2, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "hogan the grip's low you got guys like jimmy walker the grip's a little bit higher stands up so we can't necessarily say that impact", "start": 116.64, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "where the golf club is is the same way we like need to get the golf club back to the same spot in space the impact changes slightly because everybody grips", "start": 125.52, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "the golf clubs slightly different and so the match-ups required to get the face and the path aligned where they want it to go might be slightly different right", "start": 133.76, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "and i love what you said there match-ups is everything in this game however when you're really studying like all these really elite level players", "start": 141.68, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "you'll see the golf club in an extremely similar position in one spot in the golf swing and that's what we call honey hole like the club itself", "start": 149.2, "duration": 17.837999999999997}
{"chunk": "just the geometry of it where it's at where the face is pointing the shaft the grip is in the same position with almost every really high level player right", "start": 158.879, "duration": 17.922}
{"chunk": "here in honey hole so again getting back on topic here milo where i'm swinging up to the top what to do from here i think was the question yeah so", "start": 168.0, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "in my vision there really is no such thing as the top of a golf swing the golf swing is a swing but we're going to use that arbitrary spot as kind of the top", "start": 176.72, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "so we we arrive up here where the club begins to change directions and our body begins to change directions what do we want to see happen", "start": 185.68, "duration": 15.680000000000001}
{"chunk": "so number one if we're looking at like hip depth which is like a super like common term now we're always looking at trail hip we", "start": 193.599, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "don't really necessarily care about what's going on in this lead hit because i can move this lead hip correctly but the trail if i don't maintain or create", "start": 202.239, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "depth in it and now i'm an extension so problem right so from here we want trail hip depth and just that little move look at what the", "start": 211.04, "duration": 15.677999999999999}
{"chunk": "golf club does i didn't do anything up here at all with my arms hands nothing right lowers everything kind of down it lowers everything down exactly and you", "start": 218.799, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "can do some different kinds of things just to get the golf club in different positions back there if you wanted to with maybe your arm structure you could", "start": 228.0, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "go internal rotation that gets the head a little bit deeper if you wanted to do that especially with guys that like to draw that's helpful you can do some stuff with your hands where we've got", "start": 236.319, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "lead wrist flexion to control the face just a little bit more all that stuff again that's in match-ups but just generally where the instrument", "start": 245.519, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "is located won't if i just sit only that now the golf club's in honey hole and this is what we actually deem as the finish of the backswing", "start": 253.92, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "so we'll put energy in won't and float to here that's the finish of the backswing in our minds at our academy cool we're floating into here that's it", "start": 262.72, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "so your goal is to float to there and then let the energy go float to honey hole turn and shoot it out into finish awesome well we've got one of your", "start": 271.6, "duration": 16.880000000000003}

{"chunk": "honey hole and to deliver that nice strike yeah um so the way that i float into honey hole is and again we're talking about top of the back swing but kind of the finish of", "start": 296.96, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "the backswing in my mind is is that honeywell place right so floating in the honey hole is at what traditionally would be called the top of the backswing the first thing", "start": 306.16, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "i do is i sit create some flexion in that right hip socket right so here it's kind of the sitting motion and if i do that properly", "start": 315.12, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "that golf club as riley was saying was kind of just floats into that spot there's not a lot that i tried to do with my arms my hands any of that really", "start": 324.0, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "so that's the real key we're not we're not pulling it down on the golf club to try to make the thing go fast out of the out of the top we're floating into that", "start": 332.24, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "position and our arms are kind of just weightless that's a great point because we don't want to like shoot energy out of the system too early because then the whole thing gets just kind of thrown out", "start": 340.08, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "of whack right i don't have as much speed actually at golf ball where i need it so that's why we kind of hold on to it a little longer", "start": 349.199, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "sit and now from here i'm able to shoot all the energy out of the system that way not here right awesome so it looks a little", "start": 357.199, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "something like this good so if you do that again teej if you can i think this is a good good training for this show me or show us one where", "start": 364.639, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "you put quite a bit of energy in the system early in your backswing okay and then super chill it out into honey hole and then you can shoot it back out all", "start": 378.24, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "in one motion right but manage your energies beautiful like right there that's an even better strike than the first one yeah you'll notice how like chilled out", "start": 386.8, "duration": 20.078000000000003}
{"chunk": "up here it is it's like energized right once he energizes it then it's floating this is all organization time yeah and i think that's why i like your term", "start": 396.639, "duration": 18.642000000000003}
{"chunk": "there's not necessarily a top of the backswing position because if you do that if that's your mindset you're going to carry energy up here for too", "start": 406.08, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "long most likely right energize boom it all floats in the honey hole and then you can energize again to shoot all the energy out like tj was talking about", "start": 415.12, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "right i like to think of it as a swing set so when i'm on a swing swinging when the swing set arrives up here", "start": 423.199, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "it doesn't just immediately change directions it kind of comes up floats and then gravity takes over and", "start": 431.68, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "it accelerates down exactly right yep shoots energy back out so all that is like you're just storing energy up here almost like feels like you're getting", "start": 438.88, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "rid of it like it's like chill a little bit of rotation on the other side away we go awesome awesome so i hope you guys have all", "start": 446.4, "duration": 16.16}
