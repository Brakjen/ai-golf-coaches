{"chunk": "it yeah I hear people poo poo the idea of holding things off but I think a lot of tour players hit a lot of hold iron shots", "start": 65.479, "duration": 15.321}
{"chunk": "exactly there's plenty of guys that are flighting those shots now yeah there's various conditions wind and everything but even on a just flat normal day 80\u00b0", "start": 83.84, "duration": 19.720000000000002}

{"chunk": "this more with we're turning the handle so the handle's basically passive or relatively you know there's probably there is some Force being applied but", "start": 157.959, "duration": 18.482}
{"chunk": "most of that Force being applied is coming through the how the chest is yes moving and I think that's the key most people the reason they can't hit this", "start": 167.92, "duration": 19.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "shot is they start to apply Force like this causing them to react so they jump and they throw it at it and", "start": 177.0, "duration": 19.04}

{"chunk": "falling a little more on that lead side they're kind of back and then what I see from there is they kind of power and shift at the same time so the club gets", "start": 213.599, "duration": 19.201}

{"chunk": "bit Scoopy let's say and a question or an observance I see often is when I see a player's arms lagging yes the reason", "start": 239.959, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "they're lagging is not so much how they're using their arms it's how they're using everything else yeah so if I'm over here and now I decide I got to", "start": 249.319, "duration": 18.841}

{"chunk": "forward naturally they're they're Trail arm takes up the slack y so to me what I see is they go together you get somebody", "start": 267.24, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "that probably turns a little flat maybe they even lower in their back swing and it's like a standup push off the right", "start": 275.32, "duration": 15.48}

{"chunk": "shot on command and that is something that most of you at home probably don't quite have so let's go a little bit more into how we hit this shot yes cuz I", "start": 431.319, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "explained some of the basic principles the chest is dropping the chest is turning yes the hands are not powering it yeah for me there's a matchup and", "start": 439.96, "duration": 21.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "this matchup is my right wrist and my chest if I can just feel those two go together I can execute this shot pretty", "start": 449.56, "duration": 19.519}
