{"chunk": "i know a lot of you guys really liked it about what's lead arm abduction abduction where the arm actually comes off the chest i had a lot of questions", "start": 25.199, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "on this topic about how that arm comes off the chest if i'm turning people thought if if you're turning wouldn't the arm just stay connected now", "start": 34.0, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "i'm going to show you what the dynamics are that actually allow that arm to come off so you can accelerate your hands more and in turn accelerate the club more so", "start": 41.36, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "i've got henry fall out here with me henry is part of milo line's golf now and he's going to be helping me a lot with the site and he's actually a really", "start": 50.559, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "good player as well and a really good coach so let's talk through this a little bit henry so we know from looking at gears", "start": 59.12, "duration": 20.399}
{"chunk": "the best players in transition their lead arm adducts which means it goes more across their chest but then from about the time their arm", "start": 68.4, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "their hands reach this position through the golf ball their hands are actually or their arm is moving off their their chest and their body is", "start": 78.4, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "still rotating how's that possible what's what's what's one of the keys or what is the real key that allows that to be able to happen", "start": 86.4, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "well i mean if you think of your right arm here eventually you need to make room for this right arm to travel", "start": 94.0, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "right so so if my left arm's on my chest i got no room exactly so your right arm how does it function in a golf swing", "start": 101.04, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "right it's much like skipping a rock or somewhat like throwing it doesn't really go as external as throwing does but it's somewhat in that manner right", "start": 111.04, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "the real difference there's two arms so it's not going to go as external as a throw but the right arm is definitely moving", "start": 120.479, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "like i'm going to throw this way so if i was going to throw it at the camera my right arm would work like this now if i connected my left hand you can see that's not", "start": 128.239, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "touching yeah why don't you turn for the so do that same motion you just did just i'm going to throw a ball like this now my put my", "start": 135.599, "duration": 15.361999999999998}
{"chunk": "my left arm on and you can see that there's space there now go back put your right hand back where that left hand was now let's get your left arm pinned", "start": 143.76, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "against your chest so what does this look this looks like the most stuck position i've ever seen so he has no room to operate", "start": 152.959, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "yeah so if you're not getting your left arm off your chest the culprit is probably your right arm what's probably happening is in transition", "start": 162.08, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "your body's turning and your right arm is staying back yeah okay so now this will be the next question everybody has", "start": 170.64, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "how do we fix it if you're doing that what do we do to stop it well there's lots of things we can do one really good thing you can do", "start": 178.879, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "is hit some hit some shots with a ball between your arms right because if my arm falls back and there's a ball between my arms the ball's on the ground now yeah so i'm", "start": 188.08, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "going to have to figure out how to move this unit together and that's going to create that abduction that i'm looking for right", "start": 197.04, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "okay one of one of ben hogan's big things was where that right arm traveled and he used to put a belt around his arms now it's a little opposite of the", "start": 205.04, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "ball because the ball you have to hold whereas the belt you're almost pushing out yeah now in reality most really good players at impact their", "start": 213.36, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "their lead arm is not straight yeah so this would be an exaggeration keeping it like that in reality this arm is actually pretty", "start": 221.28, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "there's a lot of slack in it yeah and because there's slack in it when i go to turn you can see that turns that into kind of a bow", "start": 230.239, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "so that speaks to the flow you often bring up in these videos for sure everything's a flowing motion and because this arm is actually not", "start": 237.36, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "tense i'm not pushing it out it's soft so when i get to impact this arm looks like this and this arm looks like this and that's that", "start": 246.56, "duration": 18.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "i call it the home plate look at impact most really good players have this home plate load so if i'm at home and i'm doing this", "start": 256.079, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "this adduction feel where the left arm stays up to start the downswing what would be the next step for me", "start": 264.32, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "if i'm here i've got this left arm kind of feeling up and on my chest it's got to still come off right the next step is your body just keeps", "start": 272.16, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "unwinding but because you've loaded this lat yeah and your right arm is functioning correctly now this is going to sling off", "start": 280.8, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "of you naturally just like it does there so do that same thing facing the camera so everybody can see what happened there", "start": 290.16, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "so it adducts now because it's all loaded you can see how loaded up this all is now it's naturally going to start to sling off and you can see here", "start": 297.759, "duration": 20.481}
{"chunk": "there's a window yeah and that's what most of the best players look like and this doesn't go down the line it goes back around it goes back around", "start": 307.68, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "so your chest is turning and your arms are swinging it's not all connected right so we're not swinging connected like this", "start": 317.12, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "yeah these are free these are independently operating contraptions that we're slinging around ourselves", "start": 326.32, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "and that's how it's done so it's all your arms are independent your right arm is functioning and it's creating this look in the left arm", "start": 335.039, "duration": 18.881}
