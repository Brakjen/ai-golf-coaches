{"chunk": "pretty much constantly about width in the golf swing what is width yeah i think it's a great question and", "start": 13.679, "duration": 17.042}
{"chunk": "i think that you look at people are trying to obtain with it's a great thing to try obtain because it can help you shallow out the club it", "start": 22.4, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "can help you create a more pivot driven motion right so with i like to think of it as sort of the distance from our center our sternum sort of", "start": 31.599, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "right out to our hands or the handle of the club okay also you could think of it in terms of how close the club head is to us as well right", "start": 41.2, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "so now you and i talk a lot about the hinge and the fold of the right wrist into extension so", "start": 50.64, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "i actually like to see the club get you know not super out here like that would a lot of people think that's with where the head is okay but i also think", "start": 58.64, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "this is has no power well there is no power there but there's whip there's waves you have your arms are long still right so this is the same but this is", "start": 67.92, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "the same distance from the your chest as that yes so they're both white what i would consider with and the thing that shallows your arms out", "start": 76.159, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "gets your arms to come down is actually this folding and unfolding of the right arm okay so in a golf swing there is an element of", "start": 83.92, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "up and down right definitely the shoulder goes from extended fully", "start": 93.52, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "to flexed and it's going to come down some amount not all the way back down but some amount and most of that is created by the folding", "start": 102.0, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "and unfolding of our right arm so our right arm doesn't really lift that much here in the shoulder it does mostly it's mostly lifting", "start": 111.6, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "in the hinge here yeah so as my elbow hinges the width is actually getting slightly narrower in the backswing right", "start": 120.0, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "and for most amateurs we see too much of this well and this is if i turn you to the camera here here you go i mean i i'm only a couple fist lengths away from", "start": 130.0, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "your hands yeah i got a hole right here between my hands all right i see that often yeah their hands come off the club a lot of time", "start": 138.879, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "that's that's caused because they didn't turn enough in the backswing yeah so as they're swinging the club back their brain says i gotta make some leverage so i can hit", "start": 147.04, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "this thing hard yeah now we've got no width ideally what i like to see is", "start": 156.319, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "the right arm not folding much beyond 90. you know so 90 degrees looks like this so as i'm turning", "start": 165.84, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "not much beyond that so i think this is important i'm going to swivel here for a second you're talking a lot about the right arm", "start": 174.0, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "okay a lot of people when they think of width or in a golf golf swing is they they talk about let's keep the left arm", "start": 181.599, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "straight or the lead arm straight so they lock it out right and there's also if you lock this out and it gets really jammed up there's a lot of tension in", "start": 189.2, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "here that can limit the amount of distance we have as well that we can generate but but if you if you want real width you're", "start": 197.44, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "actually talking about your your trail arm or for most people their dominant arm feeling wide yeah we we really don't want", "start": 206.64, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "anything tense in the golf swing so i don't want to feel like i'm jamming my left arm straight i could actually jam my left arm straight and pull my right", "start": 215.28, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "arm across me and screw up my width yeah which i see that often as well yeah so for me when i focus when i'm thinking about width what i'm thinking mostly is", "start": 223.28, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "i'm thinking about my trail arm for me i'm a right hander this arm i barely know it's attached to me so i have very little control over it", "start": 232.64, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "this one i'm pretty good with so i want to feel like i'm making a big wide slap boom i don't want to feel like i let", "start": 241.68, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "this bunch up on me yeah because then it turns into steep and over the top yeah from here how would you get this thing", "start": 248.959, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "shelled out you know it's gonna be this no matter what yeah rarely do you see somebody go here and then figure out how to get it to do that", "start": 257.759, "duration": 16.082}
{"chunk": "and widen back it's almost like they're chopping wood with an axe right so it's almost like they're folding this up and if i turn i mean", "start": 265.36, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "it's like it's like that yeah right so if you're gonna chop wood maybe don't fold it just feel like you stay wide", "start": 274.8, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "so when i think about what most golf instructors are talking about when they mean width what they're really talking about is how this right arm", "start": 284.72, "duration": 19.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "hinges or folds and how it unfolds because as this unfolds you can see the effect that that has it brings my left arm down yeah some amount", "start": 294.0, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "i don't even have to pull my right arm down that much i can just let this unfold and now the club shallowed out okay back where i want it", "start": 303.759, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "so there's definitely going to be an element of that in the golf swing okay so let's let's go back to what i mentioned a little bit earlier about how", "start": 311.68, "duration": 15.678}
{"chunk": "you know from me to that club head well that's really long it's wide but because i haven't really set any angles here i'm losing out a big power source which is", "start": 319.039, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "the wrist so i think it's important for the audience to kind of to know is that just because we're hinging the wrist that doesn't", "start": 328.16, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "necessarily mean we're getting narrower right necessarily you know there's still width here from here is the same as the distance from there", "start": 336.32, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "more yeah right hardly any difference so and this is going to have more power in the long run right you've got potential energy stored because you've created an", "start": 345.28, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "angle that you get to unload right so if you're looking at a swing from face on you know the the guys that are the most powerful they're gonna have some of that", "start": 352.88, "duration": 18.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "angle coming down you know they're not gonna be as out here for sure no right generally they're converting", "start": 362.4, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "this upward caulk into more of a extended right wrist position yeah which may or may not flex the lead risk", "start": 370.319, "duration": 15.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "depending on their grip in their lead wrist but that's what really matters we want to have that angle in the right wrist yeah now we got some great drills and", "start": 378.88, "duration": 19.200000000000003}

{"chunk": "yeah if we don't have any structure then it's going to the club's kind of all over the place and managing the face becomes very difficult yeah but just a", "start": 404.319, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "simple one you can do is basically just feel like your arms are kind of out extended right and just feel like you you basically have no fold", "start": 411.84, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "and actually no hinge and just make some swings where you really are just basically swiveling just and turning", "start": 421.52, "duration": 15.84}

{"chunk": "just letting your arms flail away cool well i think that's a great discussion on with and hopefully you guys got something out of this about", "start": 465.68, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "the difference between what we see and with versus maybe some other things you've heard before but really for us it's the distance from our center", "start": 474.16, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
