{"chunk": "landing that thing and then delivering the club into the ball so we're gonna call this the john daly moves stomp and compress so milo talk us through this footwork of", "start": 10.32, "duration": 18.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "john daly the great john daly one of the best ball strikers to ever live on the longest hitters we've ever seen bomber with a huge golf swing yeah", "start": 24.88, "duration": 17.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "more like a long driver than a typical tour player but with some hands of gold right has so good he might be one of the most talented players ever", "start": 33.68, "duration": 17.598}
{"chunk": "i'd argue that point i'd say maybe the most talented player ever quite a talented man okay so what we see with john daly is basically everything i like", "start": 42.719, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "to see in a flowing athletic motion he's got a definite rhythm and trigger you can see there's like a little", "start": 51.52, "duration": 16.720999999999997}
{"chunk": "he almost stomps his right foot boom as he gets going huge so you can see the dynamics", "start": 59.12, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "he stomps into the ground huge wind up i can't do it but huge wind up gets this lead heal off the ground and then while", "start": 67.04, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "the club is finishing its wind up stomps it back down and you can actually see when he lands his heel", "start": 75.68, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "lands slightly closer to the target than where it started just slightly but this huge wind up and fall", "start": 84.64, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "and he doesn't pull down with his arms in transition he uses that fall into the ground to create the energy now his arms and hands are in", "start": 94.32, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "motion yeah not because he used his arms and hands but because he used that his legs and his body to move them and when you see you can", "start": 103.92, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "actually see videos of him from sort of target side or even face on where you see this sort of stretch as he stops in", "start": 113.439, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "in his backside you can really see that and that sort of initiates that pivot through the golf ball because he actually pivoted pretty darn good", "start": 121.92, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah he was he was special and so what's happening is this club is still working this way so", "start": 130.479, "duration": 16.242}
{"chunk": "you got a almost a one pound club you got 30 pounds of arms and your torso still going still", "start": 138.64, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "everything still wanting to go this way when this left side or left leg stomps and squares back up so that's creating all that stretch through your body", "start": 145.76, "duration": 19.118000000000002}
{"chunk": "creating a big load of those muscles now those muscles are like stretched out and ready to launch so for a guy like him too", "start": 154.959, "duration": 15.282}
{"chunk": "bigger guy big backswing that sequence is like really really important and how he if he just pulled that club from the top i don't", "start": 162.48, "duration": 15.277999999999999}
{"chunk": "think you would hit it nearly as far what about you he wouldn't hit it nearly as far and he would never find it so he had to have a great sequence his arms", "start": 170.879, "duration": 15.682}
{"chunk": "broke down more than most yes they had to widen back out somewhere along the line to be able to get the face back square it's pretty special that motion i would", "start": 178.08, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "not necessarily recommend some of the elements the big long arm swing where the right arm folds up almost too much", "start": 187.28, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "the club droops down and points at the ground for most of us we're not athletic enough to manage that yeah but he could", "start": 195.44, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "and i i wonder if he got that heel raise growing up maybe watching jack nicklaus that might have been his inspiration for that i would almost guarantee his a lot", "start": 202.72, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "of his inspiration came from jack but also when you're a kid and you're trying to hit a ball far you're probably going to pick that left heel up a little bit i guess too i'm pretty sure there wouldn't", "start": 211.2, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "weren't a lot of coaches touching that golf swing i'm pretty sure it was mostly self-made and his whole goal in life was probably to see how far he could hit it", "start": 220.48, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "as a child and so he came up with that and when a really good athlete has a goal of hitting it as far as they can they move", "start": 228.959, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "athletically yeah and he does okay so big takeaway here as the club is still moving its way in the backswing", "start": 236.239, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "that's when we want to begin to land and that's what pulls the club back around for us versus us initiating from the top with our hands and arms correct", "start": 243.519, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "that's correct okay let's do let's i'm gonna move this camera face on we're gonna do a little exercise to teach them this okay all right milo here's a little", "start": 254.08, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "exercise they can do it's something we do with students sometimes and that is heel tappers so i'm actually gonna turn to the camera here all right so what you talked about with daley", "start": 262.0, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "is how to start this backswing he might have actually had a little pressure shift left and as he was doing that his right heel came up and then he", "start": 271.12, "duration": 15.598000000000003}
{"chunk": "pressed it down to start his backswing you actually do this a little bit in your golf swing too right every swing okay so a little bit of a heel raise plant it", "start": 279.199, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "that gets the club going back as the club's still going back you'll plant in the lead side to start pulling us around that's", "start": 288.479, "duration": 19.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "awesome yeah it's the pressure shifting at the proper time so it's preceding the club constantly yeah okay show us how it's done so you're gonna do your little", "start": 299.68, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "heel tappers maybe even start the club at the target okay i recommend that one right sure so we could", "start": 308.8, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "start the club at the target and as i'm doing that the thing that makes the club change directions each direction", "start": 316.08, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "is the the plant wow he hit me sorry felt the ground shake on that one", "start": 326.24, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "thunderous i bet you could feel the ground shake when john daly was hitting probably at least hear it pretty powerful", "start": 335.52, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "so now this time i'm not gonna throw the club forward i'm just gonna it's just such a flowing motion when you see that i can just every time you move your feet i'm like", "start": 355.199, "duration": 18.162}
{"chunk": "boom boom you know i think it's no coincidence that the great swingers of all the great movers sneed", "start": 366.08, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "hogan bobby jones jack nicholas and now john daly kind of moved their feet around didn't they they sure did they didn't keep them", "start": 374.16, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "stuck in the mud but it was also a response to the sequence and winding up the unwind right it wasn't just them", "start": 383.039, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "it was a timing mechanism as well i think part of being able to create that nice flow is having something to time so it's like", "start": 391.199, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "a dance move you've got this flowing of pressure and you can feel it in your feet there you go stomp and compress like john daly", "start": 398.96, "duration": 17.679}
