{"chunk": "exist when they took an x-ray yeah yeah they looked at the x-ray and they're like there's no this here it was pretty scary looking at it but so", "start": 49.52, "duration": 19.598}
{"chunk": "you know it's been tough uh i mean i've been better and worse at different times yeah and i've gone through cut several two two three weeks where i didn't touch", "start": 58.719, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "a golf club so it's been i haven't been able to work on this like i wanted to i feel i can really get it i can tell you this", "start": 67.439, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "um when i get it right it's good like i hit 2-3 woods 277 yards on different holes", "start": 75.759, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "not downhill or downwind and i hit uh two more at a different on different golf courses that were about 270. that's huge for me", "start": 85.36, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "you know and i've had some drives that were out around 280. most of the time i'm back because i know i'm not getting it", "start": 94.159, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "yeah but when it's there oh it gives you chills it's so good for somebody my age and stuff you know yeah cool well i know you've also struggled with", "start": 101.68, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "some miss hits your your back's been hurting you yeah you're not quite doing everything correctly so i want to give you a little way of finding your golf swing quickly every", "start": 110.96, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "day okay so i want you to start off with this little drill here's what i want to i'm going to show you at first because i noticed i was as i drove up i was watching you over there getting", "start": 120.0, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "warmed up and i noticed you were going this way if i do this and i've got", "start": 128.879, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "back problems yeah i'm in problem i got real problems now so what i want you to feel is you're going to just swing the club back to here and then you're going to make this left", "start": 136.879, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "hip go out of the way so you're just pushing this out of the way and hitting a little pitch shot out there and for right now i want our target line to be kind of out", "start": 146.0, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "toward that black flag or just just to the right of it somewhere in there okay yep left hip around and feel like your right wrist stays", "start": 153.76, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "back like this so you're here now make your left hip turn that feel that yeah okay so you're just gonna hit some little ones", "start": 162.72, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "like that nope it's all right we're not trying to hit it high in the air we're just clipping it off the tee and i feel like you're kind of driving it out there low this is really different", "start": 170.8, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "than what i've been doing yeah you've had a little more sliding yeah well and when the back gets bad the slide comes into my game", "start": 184.0, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "that's interesting because that makes the back curt work yeah well i don't know if it helps me get turned more could i go this way and then i got to come back", "start": 192.239, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "and that's and the worse the back is the more i do that and the worse the back gets because of it and it's like a downward spiral yeah", "start": 200.08, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "exactly so what you showed me here this little turn there and then yeah there you go feel like that left hip just pushes out of the way", "start": 206.64, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "and then you just hit a little chip shot i can definitely see you're you're fighting your back a lot more than you were a mon three months ago", "start": 216.48, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "yeah it's been bad i've been able to put the time in to practice this i know i can get it if i could just", "start": 223.599, "duration": 15.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "spend some time on the ring okay build it still get i want to get back up there yeah you know the old swing that's what", "start": 231.36, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "you were trying to do you were right in the club at the target right so it's you're going to hit the ball and the club's going to go around left", "start": 244.4, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "now in reality this will release on a full swing but right now i want you to get your body more activated so we're taking the", "start": 253.439, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "release away let me help you feel it let's do a practice swing it back", "start": 260.959, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "okay now we're going to feel feel that do it again swing it back there you go you're getting this to come like you're pushing your left hip back", "start": 268.88, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "and trying to get the pressure into your left heel feel that does that hurt", "start": 278.08, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "it's just my back so messed up you know looks like we might be fighting an uphill battle with that motion", "start": 284.639, "duration": 19.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "okay hit one more if your body's not moving good i'm gonna i have another i have a lot of magic tricks for how to play i noticed earlier when i was watching", "start": 297.759, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "you warm up you were really stiff okay so here's what i want you to feel today today's a different day than most", "start": 305.44, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "some days are i want you just to feel like you're taking the golf club throw it up and let it come down", "start": 315.759, "duration": 20.481}
{"chunk": "on its own weight like that okay see what that looks like that's it's a different kind of swing than what i want to teach you", "start": 326.24, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "but it's another way to play that more it shouldn't hurt too much you can just take this club see how that looks yeah see how it looks", "start": 334.24, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "so you're gonna feel like you take the club you throw it up high and then you just let it fall down there you go i like that let's see you try it", "start": 344.4, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "a little better right yeah a lot better because your body's fighting you right now so getting your body to turn is not going to be your best option", "start": 371.84, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "on a day like today you're just going to want to feel like you take the club and you throw it up in the air and then you let the weight of the club", "start": 380.8, "duration": 19.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "fall down and you turn with it that's easier today right oh yeah a lot easier", "start": 386.639, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "i think for you right now the way you're moving that's going to be how you're going to swing it another thing i've been trying to find a way to play when this is all going on", "start": 400.319, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "this is it this could be the answer so you just figure out how to toss the club up into the air and then just let it fall and turn out", "start": 408.479, "duration": 15.043}
{"chunk": "of the way that was a good one that's got a wedge yeah 120 yards really yeah so it didn't feel like you're doing much right", "start": 419.599, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "no so yeah that's right now that's kind of how you need to move this is not a pivot driven golf swing you don't have a pivot", "start": 427.759, "duration": 19.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "this is more of an arm swing so you're swinging the club up and you swing and you let the club go through you just have to go with what you have yeah", "start": 440.16, "duration": 17.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "if the pivot can't power then you can't use the pivot right so wow just feel like you sling it up so you", "start": 448.4, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "throw it up high and then just kind of go with it quite catch that sweet but that uh i see my back's already starting to ease", "start": 456.96, "duration": 15.838}
{"chunk": "up a little yeah just a different way of another way to swing when you're a wounded person that's better", "start": 468.319, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "[Applause] that actually sounded like it hit the middle of that club yeah and i i took a little divot there yeah you're", "start": 479.4, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "starting to be able to draw the ball a little bit [Applause] so i think that's probably right now", "start": 488.72, "duration": 15.539}
{"chunk": "with the way your back's feeling i think that's probably our best option because you you can't turn and stay bent over right so we might as well not try yeah", "start": 506.319, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "we force it exactly start what's that say just basically same thing so just feel like you're taking that club and i want you to feel like you're tossing it up here", "start": 515.599, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "so you're just tossing it back behind yourself and then just turn out of the way with it feel good that felt", "start": 524.64, "duration": 21.038}
{"chunk": "oh that's the way it's supposed to feel there yeah that was good you're just taking the weight of that club and you're", "start": 536.08, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "throwing it up here then you're just letting it fall and you're going with it you can't drive it and make it go faster you just need to use gravity okay", "start": 544.72, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "that was better a little thin but that was good really feel like you toss it up high ooh solid contact yeah", "start": 557.839, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "pretty good little cut fades a little i haven't quite got it yeah that was pretty good though for me i you're not hurting anymore though right", "start": 569.36, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "oh it's actually eased up quite a bit that's good yeah so i've got the distance back and if i do what you want i get more", "start": 577.279, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "yeah but some days you don't feel good yeah so you've got to be able to i'm not positive that you're going to be able to swing it how i would", "start": 590.72, "duration": 17.438000000000002}
{"chunk": "my model because you know you know you got degenerative back yeah so we have to figure out a way that you can", "start": 598.959, "duration": 15.522000000000002}
{"chunk": "still play and have fun though and not hurt how was that pretty good there straight now we're cooking", "start": 607.68, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "[Music] that was good i'd get out of here yeah i hit it right over the green in the air that's amazing you can get me to hit it that", "start": 632.96, "duration": 18.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "easy that far there's a lot of ways to swing it's in my opinion that's not the optimal way to swing if you can move", "start": 641.68, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "better but if you can't then we uh we do what you can do a lot of a lot of people have back", "start": 653.2, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "issues so this could really help them what do you think about hitting up on it a little more i could mention to you i like hitting up on it get yourself", "start": 663.12, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "on a nice lie over here i want you to feel like your grip's a little stronger and then just feel like you're taking the club and you're just", "start": 671.68, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "tossing it up here and then throwing it out that way okay let's see if we can get that face", "start": 679.44, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "squared up like that a little over draw but that's pretty good 252 total", "start": 687.839, "duration": 19.681}
{"chunk": "wow 200 carry on that swinging down a little too hard and letting it instead of letting it happen you let it just which could just feel like you're", "start": 701.36, "duration": 20.719}
{"chunk": "when you get it way up here boom and then you just move with it so it's just like you're slinging it up over your shoulder and then just turning", "start": 711.839, "duration": 15.038}
{"chunk": "with the club a lot more than we were getting four months ago yeah to be able to do this with tobacco way", "start": 725.12, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "it is it's impressive oh there's the shot right there", "start": 732.88, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "at that one oh yeah i almost got it to the red flag 247 total 215 in the air again and i'm not even going after it's", "start": 744.079, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "amazing you don't if you can get the club back nice and high you don't have to go after it much this is just", "start": 758.079, "duration": 16.963}
{"chunk": "you're not powering it with this anymore you're just you're using gravity so you get it up here and let gravity help you", "start": 767.68, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "another nice drive yeah and i'll tell you you had me up even more than that when i know before this started but if you can't if you can't turn you can't make", "start": 782.8, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "it you can't accelerate it much you have to just use gravity but i take these drives with what i got going on yeah i mean the 280s were fun and i'd", "start": 792.72, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "love to get there and maybe after they do what they do i can get there but uh but you can play with this yeah", "start": 801.6, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "so here we go hit a good one we go that's a walk off still going nice shot thank you okay so", "start": 809.519, "duration": 20.081}
{"chunk": "we found a way for you to swing so if your back hurts and you can't you can't turn you can just use the weight of the golf club to", "start": 820.88, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "make the swing happen okay yeah and i'm thinking about that a little bit i think that's going to help me get more used to doing this move instead of this", "start": 828.88, "duration": 16.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah you know this move is this move is dead yeah it hurts sure does okay hurts pretty quick", "start": 837.279, "duration": 23.922000000000004}
{"chunk": "thank you sir you're welcome", "start": 846.24, "duration": 7.12}
