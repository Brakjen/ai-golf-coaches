{"chunk": "Welcome back to Superstition Mountain. In this lesson, I want to talk about the question I get more often than any other question.", "start": 2.24, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "And a lot of that's because of who my mentor is, Mike Malasa. Now, this question, what it is, is Milo,", "start": 10.96, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "should I shallow the club in transition? No argument that the club shallows in transition. You can go through and look at almost", "start": 18.16, "duration": 18.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "every player. Now there are some players who will steepen it in transition but generally those players were coming from a more laid-off position. Players who", "start": 28.16, "duration": 18.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "have the club on plane or across you will see the center of mass of that golf club want to get behind them.", "start": 36.719, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "It's just the physics of it. Now the the real question is how do we get that shallowing to occur?", "start": 46.239, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "And I to do that, I want to jump into my favorite game for athletic motion, baseball.", "start": 55.84, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "Hitting a ball with a bat is very similar to hitting a golf ball. In some ways, you you see more exaggerated movements.", "start": 64.159, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "Now, when a hitter in baseball goes to hit this ball, you can see at the start for most batters, the bat is generally", "start": 72.88, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "standing up. You will see some players with it more laid down. And those players don't need to shallow it out as much,", "start": 81.52, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "but the players who have the most power generally are what I call bat tippers. So what they're going to have is they're going to have this bat more standing up and", "start": 89.84, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "then as they change directions, the pivoting of their body is going to put a torque on that bat and get it to lay down. And what the", "start": 99.36, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "pivoting of their body does is it creates some right side bend as we talked about in another video and starts to open things up. And that also puts a", "start": 109.119, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "torque on their lead arm. So it will cause their lead shoulder to rotate internally. So when they hit the ball,", "start": 118.64, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "their elbow is facing forward. You won't see a batter with their elbow coming in toward their hip. Their elbow is going to be facing forward. Now that same", "start": 125.92, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "concept holds true in golf. The best ball strikers in transition, their pivot", "start": 135.68, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "causes the club to shallow. And so what the the mechanics of that is as I change directions, I go from this", "start": 143.12, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "left side bend to this right side bend and I'm opening up. That puts a torque on my lead arm", "start": 152.4, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "and causes my arm to rotate internally and the club to shallow out. And if it works that way, that club face doesn't get wide open and I can just keep", "start": 159.519, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "turning and rip it. Here we have a really cool illustration by Dr. Mark Bull on how this shallowing", "start": 169.28, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "happens. Now, I want to walk you through what's going on here and let you look at", "start": 178.959, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "it. But first, I want to show you at a little more speed so you can kind of see how the rotation of the pelvis causes", "start": 187.12, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "the torso to right side bend. You can really see it clearly in this player. Now, let's go to player number two. And", "start": 196.48, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "I want you to see the exact same thing. So, you watch as they change directions. You can really see how that pelvis", "start": 205.44, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "changing direction causes the torso to right side bend. So what's happening is the thoracic spine", "start": 214.64, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "starts to bend. Okay. Now let's walk through and look at what Dr. Bull's findings are. So you can see as the player reaches the", "start": 223.04, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "top the lead arm adducts which means it moves more across the", "start": 236.4, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "chest and that's denoted by the blue line on the bottom. So that lead arm adducting causes that lead arm to rotate slightly", "start": 244.319, "duration": 19.999}
{"chunk": "internally coupled with the right side bending. That's what's causing that shaft to shallow out. It's not the forearms rotating or the", "start": 254.159, "duration": 20.161}
{"chunk": "wrists flexing more. It's a function of the lead arm adducting more. So here this is another major champion.", "start": 266.72, "duration": 20.802}
{"chunk": "I think this looks like Brooks Keepka. Just looking at the motion and how that lead arm looks. And you can see the the same pattern", "start": 285.28, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "here. He's going to pivot his pelvis causing his body to go into right lateral bend. There's", "start": 294.24, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "additional adduction of the lead arm. So the arms are not moving faster than the body. They're moving slower in transition,", "start": 302.08, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "which causes the shallowing. Pretty cool that science is proving what I've been teaching for years.", "start": 309.759, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "So, here we have one of my students, Dana Finkelstein. She's an LPGA tour player. And you can see as her pelvis", "start": 320.72, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "changes directions, that puts her torso into right lateral bend. and it puts a torque on her left arm", "start": 327.52, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "causing it to adduct, meaning move more across her chest and also go into internal rotation. And that combination", "start": 338.24, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "creates that shallowing of the shaft. So you can see how it shallows out and comes around and it's super stable", "start": 348.24, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "through the strike. What I see a lot of golf instructors teaching is that you want to have your arms come down. You want to have a lot", "start": 356.4, "duration": 19.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "of shallowing of the arms or that you want to let the club feel like it falls behind with your forearms rotating.", "start": 365.199, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "Now, if that happens, now that face is wide open and I've got to flip it. So, there I I I don't like that shallowing. And I also don't really like the arms", "start": 374.8, "duration": 19.841}
{"chunk": "coming down because it's really easy to get yourself stuck. So, another really commonly taught way", "start": 384.0, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "of shallowing the club out is a lot of drive of the right elbow forward and external rotation of the right shoulder.", "start": 392.4, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "Not a huge fan of that cuz in other sports like my favorite sport here, if I did that, that would be called bat drag. That's what little kids who are", "start": 400.72, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "weak do who don't have very good fundamentals. that causes the face to get really open and then you need some real", "start": 410.08, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "compensations late like a lot of snap of the left wrist. So if that's what you're doing, if we're really driving the arms forward now from here, you're going to", "start": 417.28, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "have to really snap those wrists to square that face up. It's not my favorite way to go about it.", "start": 426.24, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "So, what I'm what I'm looking for is I like to see at the top of the swing, the right shoulders slightly internally", "start": 433.919, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "rotated and then in transition it goes to a slightly less internally rotated position, but it's not going completely", "start": 442.08, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "external. So again, if we have a good pivot, the shallowing occurs naturally, which is", "start": 450.72, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "what I'm shooting for.", "start": 458.479, "duration": 3.801}
