{"chunk": "and we're doing some work from milolionsgolf.com and i'm really excited about some of the projects we have going on and there's", "start": 24.24, "duration": 16.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "a new series on the on the website on making your golf swing more dynamic and we go into extreme detail on how we do that but", "start": 31.439, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "today we're going to give you kind of a little insight for all of you on youtube and hopefully you really like this video so henry if we want to make our swing as dynamic", "start": 40.8, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "as possible there's some principles and a lot of it has to do with how we sequence our motion so that we get our muscles to load", "start": 49.44, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "correctly right because if i swing it up here to the top and i unload it in the wrong order can i hit", "start": 57.76, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "it very far definitely not so if we want to be able to create maximum speed we have to do it in the right order", "start": 65.519, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "and that's a lot of what this series talks about is how to do that so today let's let's walk through some of the principles so if we're set up", "start": 72.96, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "we're going to smash a driver out there the first thing we have to do is we have to wind our bodies up right right so what i like to see is i like a", "start": 80.799, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "little trigger move something to get myself going and then i wind up okay so when we're winding up", "start": 91.68, "duration": 15.518999999999998}
{"chunk": "what is that doing oh you're just loading everything right yes so we're spiraling up we're loading it up spiraling some things up which elongates", "start": 98.96, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "some of our muscles right so that then we can contract them and get them moving so i often hear that people talk about", "start": 107.04, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "how our muscles are not like coil springs however if a muscle is loaded i did this example", "start": 115.36, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "in the series where i load a muscle i try to use it without loading it first and hit something and i hit it pretty", "start": 124.64, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "hard and then i load the muscle correctly and let it unload and i about break the table right", "start": 133.28, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "and so a muscle that's loaded definitely has a lot more potential energy right right i mean if i was going to slap you and i was like right here", "start": 140.84, "duration": 18.598}
{"chunk": "that's not a lot of load but if i really if you really get it back here and then you get the change of direction to happen in the right order you can make this arm go pretty", "start": 150.319, "duration": 16.322}
{"chunk": "down you'd hurt me exactly so that's what we're after here we're trying to figure out how to load everything up yeah and then start the unloading", "start": 158.48, "duration": 16.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "process at the right time right so does everything unload all the at the same time definitely not there's a sequence to it", "start": 167.2, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "it's a chain reaction so as my hands finish going back what's happening well we're gonna start", "start": 174.64, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "to use the ground and then sort of our core muscles to get into the ground right and start that chain reaction which creates a", "start": 182.64, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "little bit more stretch right in those muscles and then they can start to slingshot around and you see this in the best like cameron", "start": 191.12, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "champ i mean he is going up up up up hand's still going up and then he starts down so yeah you get this major stretch", "start": 198.72, "duration": 15.518999999999998}
{"chunk": "what's really interesting you do this really well when you get to the top of your swing which way does your belt go if you pay attention which way is this", "start": 206.239, "duration": 16.242}
{"chunk": "going that lead side of his pelvis is not going up it's going down so that creates even more stretch from our body that's going up and i'm", "start": 213.92, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "swinging well that's what it does when you don't swing well you tilt the other way and now you're not good but we're not doing that there we go so that's what happens", "start": 224.159, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "when we do it right and what did that do here did you feel how that created a whole stretch on your left side yeah and i can feel in my right oblique too so you start right side bending", "start": 233.12, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "right away so you start to feel this right side bend happening that's that's what we're after so we're creating beautiful so that's created the whole", "start": 242.08, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "stretch along here now all those muscles are ready to go and they can unload through the golf ball with lots of speed yeah awesome well now that we we know that", "start": 250.48, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "let's see you hit one and see if you can actually execute okay now don't kill anybody downrange i'll aim a little left i might take a", "start": 259.6, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "little off of it but this little line stick but i don't carry a three either so i'm gonna go up up up you're gonna", "start": 267.28, "duration": 15.277999999999999}
{"chunk": "see my trigger too i actually kind of kicked my left leg so you have a little counter rotation and then you rotate up it's pretty interesting ever since i was", "start": 278.639, "duration": 19.762}
{"chunk": "a kid i started doing that that's my standard little pulley cut right there well that's a pretty good one to have in the bag he just flew it almost on the other deck on the other", "start": 287.84, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "side with a little soft cut yeah and the sequence of that motion was really good because that was probably right around 120 club head speed and you didn't even", "start": 301.68, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "try right yeah and when when you look at my swing on slow motion as you alluded to my hands continue to go up", "start": 310.16, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "as i start to kind of make that move into the ground and that transition everybody who creates lots of speed", "start": 317.919, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "does it yeah it's just it's how it works and most of the amateur players that we see on the the t deck what do you see from them", "start": 325.6, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "first thing that happens is their their hands are coming down and their belts going up yep so if we want to do the opposite we want to be able to smash it", "start": 334.479, "duration": 16.882}
{"chunk": "create lots of speed we want to create that stretch where our belt's going down as our hands are finishing going up right and that's going to create lots of", "start": 344.16, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "lots of torque in our in our muscles and they're going to be really loaded it's an awesome feel and you get that nice feeling of that flow to everything", "start": 352.72, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "that's awesome right there it goes off yep so if you like this video please like and subscribe to my channel and hit the", "start": 361.919, "duration": 16.479}
