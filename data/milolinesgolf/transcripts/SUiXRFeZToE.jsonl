{"chunk": "Now, my response to that comment is, I want you to put maximum torque on that club early in transition.", "start": 20.72, "duration": 17.998}

{"chunk": "actually want. So let's start with other sports and other activities that we do.", "start": 79.92, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "I want to start. Imagine I'm a shot putter. I've got the shot in my hand here and I'm going to throw it. How do I", "start": 88.32, "duration": 22.959000000000003}

{"chunk": "let's say I'm a weightlifter. Imagine this is really heavy and I'm going to clean it. Do I lift it with my arms", "start": 118.96, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "really fast? Or do I first get it moving, get it on my on my waist here,", "start": 129.039, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "bounce it, drop under it, and now from here, I shove it with my big muscles, get it moving again, and fall under it", "start": 136.0, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "and extend my arms. Because my arms are the fastest thing I have. They're not the strongest, and they can't produce the most torque, but they can move the", "start": 144.56, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "fastest. So, I'm going to give you an example of athletic sequencing and the the torque that it can create", "start": 154.0, "duration": 17.838}
{"chunk": "versus when I get the sequence out of order. So, in the first example here, I'm going", "start": 162.879, "duration": 17.922}

{"chunk": "about 100 lb on here. Okay. Now, in the second example, I'm going to have my arms still working away", "start": 179.12, "duration": 18.358}

{"chunk": "P5.5.\" Yeah, I get that. But if you actually go through and look at the guys who are the fastest,", "start": 247.28, "duration": 21.038}

{"chunk": "to unwind, but the hands are still moving up and back. So here we have some examples of golfers that exhibit the exact same movement patterns as the", "start": 283.04, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "baseball players. Their hands are moving up as their body's transitioning down. And all these guys create a lot of speed.", "start": 291.199, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "So here we have Tiger demonstrating the same motion. Rory, you can really see his hands moving up as this pelvis starts to go. Now you can find examples", "start": 299.759, "duration": 17.2}
