{"chunk": "so the move that I see all too often is Swing the club back it looks pretty good the system's loaded up but then as they decide to change directions", "start": 0.0, "duration": 20.838}
{"chunk": "this oh yeah Power is the system and we get something along those lines I feel like there's a button on the ground", "start": 10.099, "duration": 15.402}
{"chunk": "it's like I gotta answer something it's like wait to the ball to the ball yeah now you got that old steep pattern you're probably hitting", "start": 19.26, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "pulls probably hits chunks slices with the longer clubs lots of exciting stuff [Music]", "start": 26.58, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "Henry fall and Milo lines were back out at beautiful Superstition Mountain today we're going to be talking about this little trick to help you in your downswing so many of you", "start": 36.48, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "are getting so over the top and steep because of for this right arm and shoulder move you have in transition you've probably heard the saying before", "start": 45.6, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "in transition you want to feel like you're losing an arm wrestling match so if Milo and I were here doing an arm wrestle okay I would want him to feel", "start": 54.42, "duration": 19.858999999999998}
{"chunk": "like he's losing it in transition but is that really what's going on it looks like that's putting a lot of strain on your shoulder and arm too that's not", "start": 63.899, "duration": 15.301}
{"chunk": "what I like to see there is an element of that but I don't want you to actually lose the arm wrestle because then we're going way external too much now you can", "start": 72.24, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "get sort of dumped under tilty yeah that tends to work up the chain and it doesn't feel good to me it's like hurts okay so let's go back to this now we", "start": 81.299, "duration": 18.781}
{"chunk": "definitely don't want you to win this armrest I don't want to go that way that's what we demonstrated first now you got that over the top pattern so what is kind of going on what would we", "start": 91.32, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "like to see how about not much how about just kind of maintaining it you maintain don't let that don't let the don't win the arm wrestle and break the guy's", "start": 100.619, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "shoulder and don't lose the arm wrestle and get your shoulder broken so we're just kind of we're just kind of neutral you and I are stuck in a battle here", "start": 108.659, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "right yeah it's just it's just structured how it is and it just stays kind of how it is we don't want to Tumble it we don't want to", "start": 116.82, "duration": 19.679}
{"chunk": "dump it you know what maybe is happening is the club is actually losing the arm wrestle just a little bit and going this way but my if you watch my actual", "start": 125.939, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "forearm it's not changing directions too much and if I recall from our previous conversations", "start": 134.819, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "if you go up again to that position like just in transition I guess P5 or so okay in transition with this club kicking back", "start": 141.84, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "with that little bit of that doorknob move we've talked about wrist extension this forearm supination the trail arm that kind of gets the the elbow where it", "start": 150.959, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "needs to be anyways it's kind of it almost works just a little just a little bit more in front and that's if you want to call that losing the battle fine but you're barely losing the battle", "start": 159.48, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "yeah we don't need to get this all cranked back or drive the elbow like this why don't we do a little exercise you'd see people do in the gym", "start": 168.72, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "just real quick if you're new to our Channel and want some cool drills and exercises to help you learn more of an athletic rotational golf swing make sure", "start": 177.9, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "you guys subscribe and hit that Bell icon so you're notified when new videos are up so some of these drills are also on our website mylinesgolf.com so just some of these", "start": 185.819, "duration": 20.701999999999998}
{"chunk": "These are rotator cuff exercises so this is some external rotation yeah and then if the band was on the other side here this would be", "start": 195.78, "duration": 16.018}
{"chunk": "internal rotations so we definitely rather feel this first one I would say but that would be more in the backswing yeah when we're loading up we're getting", "start": 203.819, "duration": 16.622000000000003}
{"chunk": "this loaded like this and then we're just kind of keeping it loaded we're not unloading it and slamming it into the ground", "start": 212.76, "duration": 15.539000000000001}
{"chunk": "okay so so I guess the theory here is Milo that when it comes down to it we're just kind of keeping it fairly constant", "start": 219.599, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "right arm and radius there's going to be some fold but it's more or less kind of working with us we don't need to add in some of", "start": 227.819, "duration": 18.062}
{"chunk": "these crazy patterns with our arm no we can load it and we can let it unload because of physics we don't have to try", "start": 236.22, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "to unload it we don't have to try to hold it back or make it go back more we don't have to try to straighten it out too fast generally some people maybe we need to", "start": 246.06, "duration": 19.198}
{"chunk": "get them to straighten it you know those are things that are individual but in general I like the arm to be transported not", "start": 254.939, "duration": 18.542}
{"chunk": "the thing that makes the club move and we see that other one sometimes that you just demonstrated where they get almost external in their back swing and then", "start": 264.54, "duration": 19.380000000000003}
{"chunk": "they get super laid off and then you almost have to go well there's only one way to go and then if anything what we talk about in transition is sort of the", "start": 274.32, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "right wrist extension so that's that door knob feel and then when that there is a little bit of supination in transition and most of", "start": 282.78, "duration": 15.001000000000001}
{"chunk": "that is because of momentum you got a golf club that weighs something the body's mass changes directions yeah so as you kind of pivot", "start": 290.4, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "into that lead arm and yeah so all those things kind of line up and it the torques that are put on the club make it do that and then later in the golf swing naturally the club is going to go this", "start": 298.68, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "way so your arm is going to go from supinated toward pronation but it's not something that I feel like you muscularly have to do you can just", "start": 308.22, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "kind of let it let it do it it's happening no doubt yeah somebody that's forcing this it's probably not going to be great out of", "start": 317.22, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "the top yeah all right so Milo let's show a couple little exercises they can do to feel this one I always love to do and I recommend to students all the time", "start": 325.5, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "on our site because so often we see that right arm get too deep in some funny positions are you talking about this one yeah simply put your left hand or your", "start": 334.02, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "lead hand so you can under that trail tricep little ones like this and you don't even have to have to hit a ball but if you can feel how to do that then you can", "start": 342.0, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "actually hit a golf ball and I didn't hit it super great but it was okay but I I just like doing little air Swings with it at", "start": 350.94, "duration": 15.478000000000002}
{"chunk": "the house I grip down I just put my left hand under my right tricep and just make these little air swings and you don't even need a club you can just", "start": 358.259, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "yeah that's like a big wide slap where everything is kind of moving together I feel maybe a little stretch in transition but it's still kind of staying in front", "start": 366.66, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "and working with me so no crazy moves no massive external rotation no massive trying to tumble it over like this nope all right", "start": 376.02, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "so second drill or exercise they could do is the open Palm so if you go ahead and set up you kind of take your grip and then you're going to open that right", "start": 384.66, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "hand and you'll feel like okay so if I add some amount of why don't you go to the top and show external like crazy external with that open pump are you", "start": 392.22, "duration": 16.379}
{"chunk": "gonna be able to hit the ball like that no I don't think your right hand would know what to do all right you also don't want to go that way plus the club you", "start": 401.34, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "have no grip on the club yeah it's almost impossible it's in the wrong Arc already so with that right palm", "start": 409.44, "duration": 15.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "you have to kind of keep it on the right plane so now do it where you go internal out of the top with that right palm how does that feel to you uh not good", "start": 417.08, "duration": 18.861}
{"chunk": "feels like you're gonna hit the ball right now it feels like I'm gonna hit myself in my left shin so why don't we show them the right way where it's a little more constant like we talked about", "start": 428.699, "duration": 17.020999999999997}
{"chunk": "here we go and get that nice that right hand moving the way we talked about and you can let it go on the front side", "start": 439.199, "duration": 16.302}
{"chunk": "so there's two little exercises you can do to kind of help not win the battle not lose the battle just kind of feel like it's constant right well hopefully you like this video if you did hit the", "start": 452.099, "duration": 19.2}
