{"chunk": "hand. We don't normally have out here these a golf club. Well, that that's normally here, but that exercise band is not normally here.", "start": 13.12, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "Well, it's usually in one of our bags, but it's not always out here in a video. Sometimes we'll use it in lessons, though. Yeah, we use it in lessons, for sure.", "start": 21.52, "duration": 16.078}
{"chunk": "So, let's talk a little bit about what we've got set up here. So, you put a rod in the ground on an angle to hold the our stretch tubing.", "start": 29.279, "duration": 15.841999999999999}
{"chunk": "Yeah. What are we going to talk about? How are we going to use this stretch tubing to teach people about the golf swing? Yeah. Well, as we know, there is some", "start": 37.92, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "right there's some lateral movement in the golf swing, right? Do we like to see a lot of it? Preferably not for us, but not too much. I like to see a little off", "start": 46.32, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "the ball early converted into rotary force. So there's some shifting. We'll see. There is definitely some shift. There's got to be a little shifting because you got to get force moving side to side,", "start": 55.28, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "right? But overall, we kind of like to see a little bit more centered action. Yeah. But there's also some some force going", "start": 63.68, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "back and forth right on this other axis, right? We can say away from the target line like that. So we're kind of terming this pushing", "start": 73.04, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "and pulling. But in reality, there's really kind of two pullings going on. You have your back swing pull up into your back swing and then as you get down", "start": 82.72, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "right maybe this you could consider the push but then there's again a pull back as you open up through impact. So you're kind of making this spiral we tal about.", "start": 92.88, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So the the back swing is mainly a kind of a pulling back of the right side internal rotation of the right hip", "start": 101.68, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "and it's created by kind of your right foot's pushing this way. There you go. So that's pushing that way which creates the pull", "start": 110.24, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "right that I'm going to experience in my hands and arms just like when we push into this right side or kind of fall into this right side in the back", "start": 119.439, "duration": 18.401}

{"chunk": "pulling a lawn mower or starting a weed whacker, right? How you kind of pull this back and then pull it back again. And that's sort of the feeling you get", "start": 143.52, "duration": 17.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "to get in this this spine angle, get your shoulders on a tilt and create that bend in the golf swing, right? So, this is kind of what we have set up here.", "start": 152.4, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "Sweet. So, walk me through it. I get to be the I get to be I don't ever get to exercise. So, here we go. I'm going to put this down here. I got this thing way in the ground, so it's", "start": 161.2, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "not going to come out. I can't rip it out of the ground. Yeah. Okay. So, for me, what the back swing needs to feel like, there's a little bit of a flowing motion", "start": 169.44, "duration": 20.399}
{"chunk": "and then a little pull and turning my body like this. And I'm going to film on face on and do a little split screen so they can see", "start": 178.239, "duration": 20.44}
{"chunk": "this. Okay. So, There's not a ton of tension in that line, is there? Not a ton. So, we could even make it a little", "start": 188.159, "duration": 16.282}
{"chunk": "softer if you wanted to feel even a little bit more, maybe. Yeah. The one thing I want to make sure if people are going to do this is that they don't pull with their arm like that.", "start": 203.36, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "Yes. Because that that can create some really bad habits in a golf swing. If I start to pull my arms back, I want to feel like I'm", "start": 212.08, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "I'm using this hip and this oblique. Yes. To turn and bend me like this.", "start": 218.72, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "Well, even in the first few motions, that's why I asked you, is the tension level okay? Cuz I noticed you weren't bringing your arms way up. And that's that was probably because you were", "start": 227.36, "duration": 18.64}

{"chunk": "back by moving this forward. It won't it won't pull it back. Right. So, in order for me to get this to pull back, I've got to feel some back. This", "start": 276.88, "duration": 19.759}
