{"chunk": "left arm parallel for a majority of people see that club a little more up and down especially with an iron it almost right yeah I'd like to see the most of the set and the risk", "start": 7.919, "duration": 19.261}
{"chunk": "Happening by this point in their backswing hey everybody we're here today at Swing Away golf Studio up here in Scottsdale", "start": 17.46, "duration": 18.478}
{"chunk": "and we are going to start talking a little bit about why probably not the best idea to be thinking about keeping", "start": 31.04, "duration": 15.758999999999999}
{"chunk": "your left arm straight or locked out and also pinning it against you or across your chest in the backswing okay", "start": 38.7, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "yeah a big issue we see with players is that they take their left arm in immediately Works in and across them and another big", "start": 47.399, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "issue is players try to keep this left arm as locked as they can and often that leads to the same thing then the club kind of wanders too much in", "start": 57.48, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "once the arms are really pinned across you you don't have anywhere to go but out usually it's one of those old", "start": 66.119, "duration": 15.181999999999999}
{"chunk": "sayings keep your left arm straight to me it's just like keeping your head down yeah yeah there might be a little bit of that from time to time but it's not a", "start": 73.56, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "truth it's not a necessity I tend to like to focus on the structure being created by what the right arm is doing and how we're hinging our wrists that", "start": 82.74, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "tends to be what creates the straightening of the left arm and also the elevation of the left arm so as my right arm folds", "start": 91.86, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "that kind of elevates the left arm up for me yeah well plus if you're thinking about keeping your left arm straight I", "start": 100.32, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "mean to me it starts at setup I see a lot of people where there's just a ton of tension right at setup in that left arm you can almost their elbow is like", "start": 107.88, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "pointed right at their belly button yeah they're trying so hard to get that thing straight that it's like like their arm is like totally external and then from", "start": 116.82, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "there that shoulder is so tight that they're all you can't actually it doesn't have any swing so it can't like swing so it looks muscly and everything", "start": 125.34, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "gets out of whack there's not a lot of power in this motion we get kind of locked up and limited and at the end of the day we want to be able to swing this", "start": 134.04, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "club we want to be able to have some swing to it some speed we talk a lot about the right hand and the right arm because for most people like you guys", "start": 141.9, "duration": 18.899}
{"chunk": "probably watching at home it's probably your dominant hand most people will play golf from the hand from the side that they would throw with in their dominant", "start": 151.319, "duration": 16.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "side now we do get a lot of Canadians for me especially that play Backwards I just had one the other night yeah yeah so that that usually brings in a whole", "start": 159.48, "duration": 15.059}
{"chunk": "different bunch of issues that can come up but as far as this issue goes that old wives tale or the old saying you always hear keep your left arm", "start": 166.92, "duration": 19.38}
{"chunk": "straight yeah yeah it can be a bad thing okay so let's kind of start from the beginning you guys soften up your left", "start": 176.22, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "arm we talk we talk a lot about having a stronger left hand but no matter the grip let's soften up this left arm almost have a little fold to it at setup", "start": 184.86, "duration": 18.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "just let it be a little more chill and most most good players have a little bit of softness in that arm it's not straight and then from there let's talk", "start": 194.459, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "about how we're energizing the club in the backswing because what we tend to see happen is the left arm get pinned", "start": 202.92, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "early now what happens when we pin that early usually you don't wind up enough and usually the next issue is you're", "start": 211.019, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "gonna throw it out over out over the top because there's nowhere to go yeah so we want to have room to to", "start": 219.599, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "move if this gets cross you too soon now your sequence is going to get thrown off ideally we want to see that that left arm being moved", "start": 227.04, "duration": 20.639999999999997}
{"chunk": "by our pivoting motion yeah so you can see my left arm is moving but it's not coming across me too soon yeah when you say a cross too would you", "start": 237.299, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "say the position of this arm isn't working across our midline early it doesn't work across our midline early and for most players it doesn't work", "start": 247.44, "duration": 17.94}
{"chunk": "that far across our midline in the entire backswing so it's not working so much across what's bringing this arm up", "start": 257.1, "duration": 17.101}
{"chunk": "and around is really what you're saying it sounds like is energizing it with my turn and my wind-up yeah you're turning your wind up is what's moving this left", "start": 265.62, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "arm now the folding of my right arm is what's going to elevate the left arm up into the plane that I want it on off the", "start": 274.32, "duration": 15.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "top of my backswing so I'm not really pulling it over there with my arms yeah I'm winding and then my right arm is just folding and that club naturally", "start": 282.479, "duration": 16.859}
{"chunk": "just goes right up where we want it and then let's talk a little bit about the right arm fold because we do see a lot of people get that kind of narrow folded", "start": 291.419, "duration": 16.322}
{"chunk": "up past 90 and that kind of goes with that left arm working in a cross usually those two are coupled exactly so when you say the fold of the right arm", "start": 299.28, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "how do we make that happen so the club kind of stays in front of us and we work up into that nice left Bend we talked about ideally the right arm only really does", "start": 308.4, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "it elevates a little bit not a lot the right arm elevates just slightly and then it folds now if I take and I turn", "start": 317.28, "duration": 15.660000000000002}
{"chunk": "into my back swing you can see that that would look like pretty good right arm structure right and I didn't really have to move it very far yeah so in reality", "start": 325.979, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "the right arm is not moving that far in the golf swing and that's what that's what's creating the elevation of the left arm so it's mostly red it's having", "start": 334.08, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "some Dynamic wrist action allowing this right wrist to extend and work up into hinge in the backswing for some people", "start": 343.32, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "probably sooner than they actually do yeah I think a lot of people benefit from getting it loaded earlier because I think a lot of the players who suck it", "start": 352.62, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "in like this yeah partly because it feels heavy when I if I'm not loading this up yeah this feels", "start": 361.5, "duration": 15.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "really it's heavy now and I I can't get it to load once I do that I mean how many students have we seen at left arm parallel with a club is like this", "start": 368.88, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "and I'm like you know you're losing a lot of power and you're having to create angles late you know I'd almost like to see that", "start": 378.36, "duration": 15.658999999999999}
{"chunk": "left arm parallel for a majority of people see that club a little more up and down especially with an Iron Man yeah I'd like to see the", "start": 386.28, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "most of the set and the wrist Happening by this point in their back swing I think in order for people to fix", "start": 394.02, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "this issue they have to learn how to put energy into the system correctly using a little pressure shift and then a wine of", "start": 402.12, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "their body so if I'm winding correctly you can see that I'm not moving my my arm relative to my body but that club is moving into the arc I wanted in nicely I", "start": 410.4, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "just wanted to say thank you to swing away golf studio for this awesome setup for today's videos", "start": 419.88, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "so focusing on how you're turning and bending can direct your arms into the arc you want them so a few exercises I've seen you do with students they'll", "start": 429.539, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "you'll have them kind of make some little steps here and then toss the club like literally toss the club back yeah hard to do this", "start": 437.639, "duration": 18.421}
{"chunk": "and half the club that way that's more of a snatching and turning in and getting out of our bends as you can see so we're tossing it up and out what's", "start": 446.94, "duration": 18.061}
{"chunk": "funny is when I have people do that the first few tosses where do they go usually the club goes so and then another one I've seen you do", "start": 456.24, "duration": 15.979000000000001}
{"chunk": "if you go ahead and face the camera real quick because I've seen you kind of hold the club and you'll kind of have them say oh you're like okay now I want you", "start": 466.86, "duration": 15.419}
{"chunk": "to make a little bit of a wind up here get some movement going get some flow going and then I Let Go me holding it back you get a feel of", "start": 474.599, "duration": 18.301}
{"chunk": "that and then it's like whoosh now you're propelling that club with your turn and you're putting a lot more energy into it", "start": 483.66, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "earlier yeah than you would be if you just grabbed it hold it back with your hands and arms yeah okay so there's probably another", "start": 490.979, "duration": 15.299999999999999}
{"chunk": "drill maybe you guys at home are thinking about that you've probably seen some tour Pros do where they take their fancy new glove and they put it under", "start": 499.08, "duration": 17.1}
{"chunk": "their left armpit yep now Milo and your experience this connection point they're making between their arm and call it", "start": 507.06, "duration": 16.1}
{"chunk": "left pack chest what's the reasoning behind this they're trying to get their arms not to work away from them in this way so you don't really want to", "start": 515.039, "duration": 17.242}
{"chunk": "have your arms rolling out away from you so that the club can fall yeah ideally", "start": 542.82, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "your arm's going to elevate but it's going to maintain its relationship more or less it's not going to get really pinned across you you're not trying to", "start": 550.44, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "squeeze the glove to death yeah he's trying not to let it fall and that goes hand in hand with feeling", "start": 559.32, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "like you're you're energizing the club and working up into our left Bend yeah when the hands what we see is when the", "start": 566.76, "duration": 16.499000000000002}
{"chunk": "hands start to work up and out you almost always especially without the hinge that club becomes heavy and they come out of left Bend and that club is", "start": 575.459, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "way behind them their arm gets trapped they let the hands go this way the club goes this way and the body bends like that yeah I want to see one with the", "start": 583.92, "duration": 15.42}
{"chunk": "glove under your armpit stable club's still there so it can be a pretty good drill but just keep in mind your your tension", "start": 591.72, "duration": 18.622}
{"chunk": "levels and what you're trying to accomplish because for many of you you'll get that glove in there and then you're going to go straighten that arm and pull it across", "start": 610.74, "duration": 16.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "you because we're still trying to keep we don't want the arm really getting too abducted across us in our backswing and I would say the last point on that is", "start": 619.019, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "for you guys at home there I've probably heard about depth or wanting to get depth let's do it with our wind up and", "start": 627.12, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "our turn versus just pinning our arms back behind us okay good true true depth good depth comes from", "start": 633.779, "duration": 16.92}
