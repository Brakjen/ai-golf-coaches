{"chunk": "into the golf ball as you can see we've got a funny contraption set up here a big exercise ball what are we calling this the anti-thruster", "start": 15.36, "duration": 18.159}

{"chunk": "henry walk us through what this is yeah so i i mean obviously not everyone has this set up at the golf course but we kind of made a", "start": 37.36, "duration": 16.32}

{"chunk": "it'll work yeah well i get a little low to ground anyways i guess but basically as you alluded to this is sort of", "start": 54.879, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "one it's keeping you your hips back as you begin to rotate and work through the shot so you can stay on your tilt this is the", "start": 64.879, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "other way where you thrust up things move out into the ball yes so that's number one so the number", "start": 73.68, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "one objective is to make sure you keep your hip depth right okay and my second objective is to make sure that you're pivoting correctly not not using a lot", "start": 81.28, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "of slide because i want to see the camera can see i want to see the tailbone rotating in the golf swing i don't want", "start": 89.439, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "to see the tailbone sliding side to side if i put my club right here for them to see you like to see that hip kind of hit it and then move back", "start": 96.72, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "yeah i like to see it go like this so there is a little move to the left but it ultimately it goes back around you yeah so", "start": 104.159, "duration": 15.602}
{"chunk": "the pressure moves left and then it's done now it goes around and so i like to see that tailbone making a circle right and so with this you actually can", "start": 111.6, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "get that feedback we can let me jump on there and show show everybody how this kind of works so with the way my pivot works if i turn back", "start": 121.119, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "you can see that ball wanting to roll that way and then when i change directions you can see the ball wanting to roll back right so my", "start": 129.119, "duration": 15.762}
{"chunk": "my pivot makes the ball want to roll roll or fall off or fall off but yeah no i i definitely see that now if you slid", "start": 136.72, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "if i or you earlier if i slid this way or this way that ball is wanting to move the ball is wanting to go that way not backward so if you're doing it correctly the ball", "start": 144.56, "duration": 15.6}

{"chunk": "from a wall it's a really awesome drill so that ball the movement that it has it kind of matches up where with the where this tailbone and lower", "start": 160.72, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "back is pointing is that correct right so if our lower back is starting to slide towards the target and pointing at the target then the ball is going to roll ball is", "start": 169.599, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "going that way if i get it to kind of bump and then move back now the ball is going to go ball's going to roll backwards yeah right and that gets that club slinging", "start": 178.959, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "off of us exactly which is what we really want to see right so awesome drill to teach you to maintain depth", "start": 187.68, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "and to pivot correctly well we got to see you hit one here and then i gotta hit one so okay this is the true test right well i'll probably knock it all off because", "start": 195.92, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "my hips go way back oh but we'll give it a try as long as it goes backwards towards the", "start": 204.48, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "camera oh okay so here we go i'm set up that was first ball of the day that was pretty good not bad i didn't want to take a huge difference i've had a few warm ups so hopefully i", "start": 212.319, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "can do this too did we see the ball rotate correctly when i did that i thought it looked pretty good", "start": 226.159, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "you always rotate while pivot wall though oh that one all right that was pretty good could you feel i've always had a little more lateral and", "start": 234.64, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "my my uh sort of uh problem with my swing i guess has always had a little bit of that that thrust into the ball but so worked on it i've gotten better at it yeah this", "start": 247.04, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "is a great drill for for mr henry fall yeah i'll leave the ball then roll down range and get blown away so let's take a look at it from another", "start": 255.92, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "view so here we set up against a wall and you'll be able to see when done properly the ball actually rotates", "start": 263.199, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "right yeah so the key is we want to make sure we're keeping pressure against the ball the whole time as we turn back and as we turn through", "start": 272.24, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "but henry give us an example real fast i just want to see if you take your set up make a turn away and you can see how that ball started to", "start": 280.4, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "roll toward the target with with his hip right there like that so it's on my trail hip right here it's my lead hips come off the ball at this point", "start": 288.32, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "yeah slightly yep if my footwear come off it'd come off even more yeah make that turn all right and then as you change directions and go the other way see how that ball starts to go backward", "start": 296.08, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "and it keeps going backwards so now this trail hips become starting to come off and this stays on yeah now show us what would happen if you did it", "start": 305.28, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "wrong so if you're a slider see how the ball wants to roll down the wall toward the target or fight or if you hump it a little bit we don't want it to", "start": 313.52, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "fall down right so this is a great exercise you can do at the house and a lot of people have these stability balls if they can't make a swing they could just do a hug right so they get the", "start": 324.0, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "feeling of this sort of turning back on plane keeping their tilt and there you go turning through and making sure that ball runs the other way we want that", "start": 333.039, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "ball to roll good that's a great feel there you go so that'll give everybody the feel for", "start": 341.039, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "how to pivot not slide yep it's always fun using these balls anyways yeah they're great it's a really good tool and it's not very expensive all right so make sure", "start": 350.0, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "you grab a stability ball try out this exercise you don't need to hit balls with this it's more something you probably do at home but it's a great practice if you like", "start": 358.56, "duration": 17.601}
