{"chunk": "extension flexion. Okay. Now, what I want to talk about is I want to talk about what happens", "start": 17.359, "duration": 17.523}
{"chunk": "from the top of our swings and why. So, I've heard from a lot of golf instructors how in transition you want", "start": 30.4, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "to add extension from your right wrist, flexion in your left wrist, and er deviation", "start": 38.64, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "in transition. Now, in my opinion, that's not quite correct. Um, er does happen in the golf swing, but it", "start": 47.6, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "happens later for me. That the er happens down in here when the when the momentum of the club starts to extend your arms and it actually", "start": 57.84, "duration": 19.52}

{"chunk": "Here we have an example of two tour players. One is a very long hitter on tour and the other is a fairly average hitter.", "start": 77.36, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "But what you'll notice is some commonalities as they change directions. Both of them gain hinge in their wrists", "start": 87.2, "duration": 20.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "in transition and they continue gaining hinge in their wrists until they reach about left arm parallel and then that", "start": 97.2, "duration": 15.84}
