{"chunk": "[Music] hey everybody welcome back out to superstition mountain hope you're having an awesome masters week my favorite week of the year", "start": 2.91, "duration": 17.091}
{"chunk": "what about you henry you like the masters pretty cool i love the masters it's just like it's like christmas for me too bad i'm not gonna get to see a whole", "start": 12.16, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "lot of it but we thought we'd bring a few scenarios that the guys are going through that are playing in the masters so here", "start": 20.16, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "we're standing on a slope and to give you an example of how severe this slope is if i spread my feet out like this my right foot is how much higher than my", "start": 28.0, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "left one here henry i would say it's a few inches at least so that's pretty severe this is probably comparable to like number 13. 13 at", "start": 36.96, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "augusta you got your dog leg left part five and the thing about that hole is you know they're usually approach shots they're in anywhere from", "start": 46.96, "duration": 15.918000000000001}
{"chunk": "hybrid to eight nine irons some like bubba's hitting it over the corner but you also have your wedge shots and those wedge shots are pretty tricky off", "start": 54.879, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "those lies yeah so why are they so tricky off that lie well with a wedge with it having more loft these these", "start": 62.96, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "clubs are actually affected more by the slope than the longer clubs for sure let's show everybody kind of why that would be so", "start": 71.52, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "right when the faces when the shaft is at normal height you can see the loft on that face would be aiming fairly straight yeah if i lay this basically what would be a", "start": 78.88, "duration": 18.158}
{"chunk": "flat lie angle now if i drop the hosel to or sorry the handle to where this would actually lay on the ground you can see that", "start": 88.159, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "that face is now pointing left yeah the more i drop it right it would be more farther left the loft ames right right and vice versa if you raise the", "start": 96.24, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "handle the the loft is going to aim slightly to the right right now that's harder to do it's really hard in a golf swing to actually get the loft aim to the right unless you open the face", "start": 104.159, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "right okay so in this scenario that ball is going to be if you set up normal the ball is going to be a couple inches almost ankle high", "start": 112.64, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "yep so your loft's going to aim some amount to the to the left so especially with these wedges i want to make sure if i'm gonna like play the the curvature", "start": 121.04, "duration": 17.838}
{"chunk": "that i should aim a little bit right of this hole for sure so how much right would you aim if you were hitting it at this pin well i mean just from my experience i", "start": 130.239, "duration": 17.122}
{"chunk": "mean i guess it's a little different for everybody but we do have a little wind off the left but i'm still probably going to aim about right edge of the green here", "start": 138.8, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "so it's about 20 feet right of the flag that sounds about right so let's see let's see execute one okay so the other thing i might do is just", "start": 146.08, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "grip down a little bit you know just because if i had it at full length theoretically my club would be a couple inches below this ball", "start": 154.239, "duration": 16.240999999999996}
{"chunk": "would you take the normal club as well so how far are we right here uh we got about 125 of the pin so from 125 what is that normally for you", "start": 162.48, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "it's about sand wedge so a nice solid a big sandwich yeah so are you going to hit a full sand wedge or would you take like an extra club and grip down on a little bit i'm", "start": 170.879, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "still going to take sandwich here with it being a you know a front pin but um definitely if i was gripping down enough i might i might take one extra club", "start": 180.0, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "yeah so if this severe if this slope was slightly more severe it would definitely influence me into taking another club and gripping down a little bit yeah but", "start": 188.0, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "if i'm just going to play this what this lit this y is telling me it's going to do curve to the left you know i'm going to aim out to the right a little bit", "start": 196.959, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "pick a spot that is lined up where i want it you know right edge of the green grip down a little bit and just see that little draw", "start": 205.84, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "into the hole you see that wind is going to hold it isn't it that wind is holding it it's a canceling wind it went right at the right edge and stayed there", "start": 215.2, "duration": 15.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah so i didn't judge the wind correctly but still tried to draw i mean it was i hit it well it was a definite draw it would have gotten all the way to the flag if", "start": 226.159, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "we didn't have 10 miles an hour of wind out of the left right henry sometimes when we we wind up on a side hill lie", "start": 234.56, "duration": 16.718}
{"chunk": "like this we can't hit the draw we can't let it draw we have to actually fight it what are some secrets to do that well", "start": 242.239, "duration": 16.642}
{"chunk": "yeah i mean you got a tree here or your back right pin and you still want to be aggressive and don't want to hook one in there", "start": 251.28, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "one thing i do is i'll actually get sort of my weight more up on my toes especially my right heel i'll pick it up so if you think about like a skier who's", "start": 259.519, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "turning right carving into the slope their weight's not down the slope like this they're fighting it right so it'd be kind of like that and what this does is it gets the handle up a", "start": 268.88, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "little bit and now the line goes more level yeah versus being level of the slope awesome so that's a pretty cool trick being able to get this", "start": 278.4, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "this trail heel kind of up and you're going to feel tall right when you do that this is something lee trevino talked about and you'll see guys at the masters that", "start": 287.12, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "with the longer club in their hand they actually do sometimes cut it into that hole on 13 or off those different lines because it augusta there's no there's no one hole", "start": 295.68, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "that's flat there no it's a it's not a flat golf course you'll see sometimes they'll play with the slope see sometimes they'll fight it", "start": 304.479, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "cool so let's see a fight at once yeah so i mean now i'm gonna aim a little left of the hole especially now that we know that wind is out of the left too", "start": 311.28, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "now i'm gonna try to just hit a little cut in there and you see my my right heels off the ground oh he did it awesome", "start": 320.72, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "oh go in stacked it in there good shot thanks so i think you're better off of uneven lies and you're off of good ones nice", "start": 335.759, "duration": 15.998}
