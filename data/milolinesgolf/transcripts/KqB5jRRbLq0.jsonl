{"chunk": "okay miles so i put out a poll recently to see what topics our viewers wanted to cover", "start": 10.16, "duration": 15.441}
{"chunk": "more in the future videos and downswing and transition was a big part of that most of them wanted that section so i", "start": 17.68, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "think lag is a topic that sort of fits in that mold okay um and something we see get asked a lot of we want lag in our", "start": 25.439, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "golf swing we want to create some angles inside some dynamics right so um what is your feeling on lag and how", "start": 34.719, "duration": 15.202}
{"chunk": "do we kind of go about achieving lag it's a complicated one so my feeling on lag well lag is a", "start": 41.52, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "byproduct not something to seek after it's a byproduct of good motion so if you have good dynamics in your swing", "start": 50.16, "duration": 20.079}
{"chunk": "you will generate lag okay that's basically so when i hear that i immediately think okay so he's saying", "start": 60.399, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "there's more to it than just our hands and arms am i understanding that correctly yeah it's a full system thing the hands and arms", "start": 69.76, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "are the lever system but if i want to have this lever be transported correctly i have to", "start": 78.479, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "input the power into it correctly so if i swing this back and i input the power from the outside of my swing", "start": 86.08, "duration": 21.28}
{"chunk": "in it's reversed and i will not have lag but if i input the power at the right time so while the club and my torso is still", "start": 96.72, "duration": 17.918}
{"chunk": "stretching my lower half begins to go the other way and the pivot just continues then i will have lag so that's why i say load and lag and one", "start": 105.759, "duration": 20.561999999999998}
{"chunk": "term you always say is tow so the analogy you've used before is with a boat and a", "start": 115.92, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "water skier a water skier so talk us through that analogy you know between the boat and the water skier there's a rope we want to make sure that that rope", "start": 124.799, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "doesn't get slack right so as long as long so as long as that boat is accelerating", "start": 133.84, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "and stay keeping keeping turning you will have slack or there won't be any slack in that rope i can hang back and chill and that water skier is going", "start": 141.599, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "to get whipped that water skier is going to fly yeah now if that boat begins to slow down or turns off", "start": 150.56, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "then the rope gets then the water skier actually gets slung around the rope gets soft and the energy is done and the water skier", "start": 157.92, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "sinks into the water eats it yes but as long as that boat is continuing its circle and maybe even tightening its circle then that water skier gets whipped", "start": 166.72, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "faster and faster and faster and when i when i think of that circling motion that boat cornering and", "start": 176.0, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "our skier getting towed i think of the club head staying back and to our right for our right-handed golfers yes", "start": 183.44, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "now that face can stay stable and there's less unload yeah early and at some point you the boat", "start": 193.28, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "is going to slow down because you're not going to keep spinning in a circle right not a figure skater so we're going to", "start": 201.84, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "put on the brakes and start to slow down which is going to transfer the energy out into the club at the right point in time because we want the energy to get", "start": 209.84, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "out into the golf club and sling that club yeah and we want it to go slack over here so that it can so we can make this nice", "start": 218.159, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "quiet finish but there was a lot of speed over here so there's important pieces all around there okay but one", "start": 226.64, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "method i wanted to talk about was this sort of with the arms and the wrists because the the right wrist as we've", "start": 233.76, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "talked a lot about on this channel is really important to creating some of that angle yes and then matching that up with our pivot", "start": 242.159, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "but um it's sort of this that setup this club more or less is sort of up our left arm and some of you guys might you know you'll see some pros", "start": 250.08, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "that's a little more straight at their sternum set up but let's say more or less it's up our left arm so sort of a straight line right", "start": 258.56, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "and then making an angle eventually in our golf swing where this left arm and club are more or less sort of at 90. yep right when it addressed", "start": 266.8, "duration": 19.518}
{"chunk": "they were probably at like 45. so you've grown that yeah that radial hinge has grown", "start": 276.639, "duration": 17.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "some 45 more degrees and it's dependent too on your grip but for as you've probably seen our channel we prefer a little stronger left hand grip", "start": 285.68, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "so that the wrist is going to move more in that fashion with that stronger left hand and i want to bring up something so", "start": 294.08, "duration": 15.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "how variable are left hand grips among elite golfers i would say there's a basically a full 90 degree variation in", "start": 302.4, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "left-hand grip from what i've seen on the tour yeah so you've got guys who grip it like this and guys who grip it like this that's a full 90 degrees difference", "start": 311.44, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "so if i'm talking about what the left hand does well there's a huge variation well i think it's so glad you brought that up", "start": 319.52, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "because everyone at home they're watching us talk about you know what the left hand might be doing and they're thinking whoa wait my", "start": 327.039, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "left hand can't do that right because you said it's just such a disparity that's why i really like the right hand i talk about the right hand significantly more", "start": 336.0, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "because the variation amongst good players right hand grips is is pretty small you know a guy who has a really strong right hand looks", "start": 344.72, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "like this yeah and a guy who has a really weak right hand looks like this that's nowhere near as much as we have guys who grip it with their left", "start": 352.8, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "hand which would be the equivalent of this and guys who so it's like right the left hand has so much more variation", "start": 361.44, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "so this angle then straight line to that angle you're seeing yeah we can really boil it down to more", "start": 368.88, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "with the right wrist the right wrist is hinged back yeah extension it's gone into extension", "start": 378.0, "duration": 15.519999999999998}
{"chunk": "and that is really just if i put my palm straight up to you guys it's knuckles going back towards the forearm yep it's not thumb going back towards the forearm", "start": 385.36, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "no that's more radial this now when we start you can see my fingers are hanging down more than my wrist is that's how my grip", "start": 394.72, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "starts by the top of my back swing my fingers are back straight but they're back so i've gone some amount radial", "start": 404.639, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "and some amount mostly extension really difficult to extend i can't extend without going into radial", "start": 413.44, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "so naturally it happened it go or without getting rid of this owner so naturally what happens is i go there so i don't even think about", "start": 420.96, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "this part of it all i think about is getting my wrist to do that so let's take it to the top let's load it let's load the angle with our turn in", "start": 429.599, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "the backswing so now you got you got pretty much maximum set here right pretty much it may be a little bit more in transition", "start": 439.44, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "but it's pretty maximum so from here to lag it what are you doing so i felt more body i didn't feel a pull", "start": 446.639, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "down i didn't feel a sharpening of the angle it felt like it just sort of stayed as this went i started unwinding from my", "start": 456.639, "duration": 17.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "pelvis and it that pulled my chest along so i went so this structure more or less is sort of maintained from", "start": 464.4, "duration": 17.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "the top all the way to what would you say club parallel to ground before it might start unloading a little early i think it probably starts", "start": 473.84, "duration": 15.599000000000002}
{"chunk": "unloading between left arm parallel and club parallel to the ground in reality what do i feel i feel like i never unload it", "start": 481.759, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "i feel like i just relax turn and allow the energy to go i just let it out i don't hold on to it i also don't", "start": 490.4, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "push it just let it out all right so load and lag it's not so much about creating angles with our hands and arms", "start": 499.759, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "and creating a lot of tension right so more or less a softer approach using our pivot that can create some of", "start": 509.199, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "those dynamics we're looking for for sure okay i guess we gotta hit one huh i guess so how are we gonna do it how about we set that angle", "start": 517.839, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "and then show one slowly where you are maintaining it with that towing pattern okay like the speed boat take us for a ride so i set the angle first", "start": 526.56, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "is that what you want me to do if you want sure that's a drill we've done before set the angle first turn slow motion toe toe toe", "start": 535.279, "duration": 19.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "feel that right wrist extension now i'll speed it up a little bit so that club really is always sort of feeling soft and to your right yeah it's", "start": 551.36, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "feeling heavy more or less naturally it goes to my left on its own but i don't you know push right up you don't try to make the the person being towed win the", "start": 564.72, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "race we got to keep them being towed exactly okay all right guys well i hope you guys uh enjoyed this video on load and lag and sort of towing", "start": 573.76, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "the club head it's a topic that we'll be covering more on in the future and something we've covered before as well so make sure you subscribe to the channel and check out milolionsgolf.com", "start": 582.48, "duration": 21.799}
