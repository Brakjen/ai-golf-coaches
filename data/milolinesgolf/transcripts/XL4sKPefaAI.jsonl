{"chunk": "one, I'm going to talk about how hand speed is created. The guys at Athletic Motion Golf, they did a really good job of ex of showing", "start": 50.559, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "that players make a lot of hand speed and they they showed a few things about the direction the hands move in the beginning.", "start": 60.719, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "But what they don't get into is how players create that speed and how the the hands move in those in the directions that they do. So in this", "start": 67.76, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "lesson, what I want to do is I want to talk about how that hand speed is created by the best players.", "start": 77.52, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "What I found is that there's basically two different ways that you can create a lot of hand speed.", "start": 85.28, "duration": 16.039}
{"chunk": "The first way is we can swing the golf club up and in transition we can really accelerate our", "start": 95.759, "duration": 19.722}
{"chunk": "hands and arms down. And you'll see that there are some players on tour who do this. So, it's a", "start": 105.04, "duration": 15.079999999999998}
{"chunk": "definitely a an option and a way to do it. In my opinion, it's not the optimal way to do it. And you don't see the best ball strikers in the world doing that.", "start": 114.88, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "It kind of goes against natural athletic motion. So, here we have an example of players who do just that. They both", "start": 123.68, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "accelerate their arms in transition. So, you can see the lead arm adduction angle immediately starts to widen.", "start": 131.12, "duration": 19.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "And these players reach maximum hand speed or grip speed about at P5 and", "start": 141.52, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "a half like the others around 22 miles per hour. But because of the sequencing, neither one of them is able to convert it into really high club head speeds.", "start": 149.68, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "We've got 110 mph and 107 miles an hour. So the second way to create a lot of hand speed", "start": 157.36, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "is to use your pivot to accelerate your arms initially and to be a platform for you to then accelerate", "start": 165.599, "duration": 17.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "your arms even further. So here we have two examples of people doing just that.", "start": 174.64, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "Here you can see the man swinging the axe and how he uses his core to drive his arms. And here man swinging a sledgehammer.", "start": 183.519, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "You can really see how he uses his core to get his arms started. And then once they're started, then he really starts to accelerate and apply", "start": 192.4, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "force to his hands and arms. That's what natural athletic motion is. And it's the most efficient way to do it.", "start": 200.4, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "So, if I want to be able to accelerate my hands and arms in the most efficient way, what what I really do is I use the same", "start": 214.48, "duration": 20.598}
{"chunk": "motion only in a different plane that I would use if I was swinging a hammer or a axe. So, when I get up here now, because this", "start": 224.959, "duration": 20.522}
{"chunk": "club's gone around me, I'm swinging that axe, but I'm swinging it around me instead of down into the", "start": 236.56, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "ground. And that creates much higher rates of hand speed because my hands are transported in the initial", "start": 244.239, "duration": 19.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "part of the down swing and then I can apply my arms to the swing. So, yes, your arms", "start": 254.319, "duration": 19.121}
{"chunk": "are moving with you. You don't keep them up. That's not really possible. My arms are up. Now, if I go like an axe", "start": 263.6, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "swinger, my arms came down, but I didn't bring my arms down.", "start": 273.28, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "And that's going to be a much more efficient way to swing the golf club than trying to accelerate your arms early", "start": 281.68, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "with just your hands and arms. We need everything. If we're going to create maximum speed, we need everything. And we need to do it in the right order.", "start": 290.0, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "Here we have an example of two players that create over 26 mph of grip speed. And they do it because they have a much", "start": 298.96, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "more athletic transition. So you can see as they begin to transition, their left arm adduction angle actually", "start": 307.919, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "decreases. So their arm gets more pinned against their chest and their arms get transported by their pivot", "start": 318.08, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "up until about left arm parallel. And at that point in time, they're creating about 17 miles an hour without using their arms. And then their arms", "start": 325.84, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "begin to accelerate, allowing them to reach above that 26 miles per hour mark by about P5 and a half.", "start": 334.479, "duration": 20.721}
{"chunk": "Most players reach maximum hand speed somewhere between P5 and P6 about right there. So halfway", "start": 344.72, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "in the middle. And what's really important is at this point in the swing, they really haven't started to give away any", "start": 354.32, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "of the angles created in their wrists. Almost every player I've looked at has nearly the same amount of wrist hinge", "start": 364.0, "duration": 18.8}

{"chunk": "I see with amateur golfers is in transition, they're making quite a lot of hand speed,", "start": 382.56, "duration": 17.441000000000003}

{"chunk": "down swing. What's happening is as they start down, they're accelerating their hands and arms either with their body", "start": 398.96, "duration": 20.479}
