{"chunk": "over okay and that's part of why you can't like you're doing a pretty darn good job not early extending look at this oh I'm not I am good I've been", "start": 143.36, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "working on that but it's almost impossible when the shaft's going out to not early extend so see how little you early", "start": 152.56, "duration": 17.56}

{"chunk": "hand copy me so I'll show you one you're just going to go gently toss it up let it lay", "start": 286.8, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "back and then just let the club run into the ball gently like that up okay that looks totally different", "start": 295.919, "duration": 15.521}

{"chunk": "just want to fall back a little bit think I'm yeah I'm still like said my wrists stiff so it's not allowing it to yep so kind of feel like my body is", "start": 350.759, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "doing it my hands are just kind of looser yep like a whip or whatever that would be kind of the concept", "start": 359.319, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "yeah one or two more of those you see the ball yeah little draw one-handed 120", "start": 367.759, "duration": 15.842}

{"chunk": "standing up but that risk going this way not whatever it was doing yeah yes that way so the secret to not having the club", "start": 391.759, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "get inside is just how if we rotate this now the club's inside if I don't rotate it early now the so we still hinge it the same but the club's standing up", "start": 401.4, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "right right okay yeah so I keep this out in front of me but now I hinge up like this right you can let that be soft", "start": 409.919, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "there you go good just go gentle okay you can go half that speed", "start": 418.919, "duration": 19.203}
{"chunk": "good did that feel different it did yeah okay hang on I want to record one and see if it looks different okay let's see if that looks any different in how your wrist is", "start": 434.12, "duration": 18.240000000000002}

{"chunk": "a lot of force in transition with your right arm so your right arm is doing this okay yep so that's our next piece of the puzzle now that we got it loaded", "start": 463.68, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "correctly now we need to get it to stop pushing the club out and forward does that make sense y so what your right arm is going to", "start": 472.199, "duration": 20.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "feel like it does is it stays soft just turns back it stays soft and it lets the club come down a little this", "start": 481.56, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "way see my finger coming down there's none of there's no push forward mhm okay so we're going to go without a ball for a", "start": 491.4, "duration": 20.879}
{"chunk": "minute and see if you can do it yeah so turn it up such a weird feeling it's like you're losing control there you go you know", "start": 500.319, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "to Let It Drop it's like what's going on there and it won't even look like it drops very much it just can't look like it's getting pushed out all", "start": 510.08, "duration": 17.92}

{"chunk": "motion good do that again load the wrist correctly all one flowing motion good now can you hit the ball", "start": 526.08, "duration": 15.399}
{"chunk": "exactly that pace for me yeah that was no speed right no speed please do no speed for me yeah okay good", "start": 534.2, "duration": 17.561}
{"chunk": "job okay little speed there a little little more speed than I wanted but look at it let's see if we're if we're making Headway I can see us making some some", "start": 552.44, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "gains here so now you're turning it back your wrists are loading oh the top it didn't come down steep look how your body rotated and", "start": 561.32, "duration": 20.079}
{"chunk": "look how you didn't early extend so those are all related all the extension pieces are when you when you go from extension in your Trail wrist and you start throwing it out your body", "start": 570.92, "duration": 17.758}
{"chunk": "says oh my goodness I'm going to hit the ground oh make room yeah that makes sense look at that it's money it's money", "start": 591.88, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "it's money so now I want you to live at that pace or slower until that becomes", "start": 601.04, "duration": 15.479}
