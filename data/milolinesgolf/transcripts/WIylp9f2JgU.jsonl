{"chunk": "good baseball player actually uses a bat okay so I've seen people say okay you keep your shoulders closed and you move the bat like this well if that's how you", "start": 78.46, "duration": 19.108999999999998}
{"chunk": "actually move the bat there's very little rotation there and you're pushing the bat you'd hit it with no power okay", "start": 87.52, "duration": 16.29}
{"chunk": "so what do actual big leaguers do so let's talk a little bit about the big-league baseball swing okay so they're set up and then as the pitcher", "start": 95.469, "duration": 21.301}

{"chunk": "now this is where it gets interesting how does the bat launch okay so", "start": 133.15, "duration": 15.01}
{"chunk": "as I walk away once that leg hits now immediately what their body starts to do it goes into rotation and as their body rotates without doing anything with", "start": 140.29, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "their hands you can see what the bat does the barrel of the bat actually falls back now why is that important", "start": 150.26, "duration": 17.69}

{"chunk": "that barrel went back okay now let's talk tennis okay so a good tennis player as the ball is coming in", "start": 233.739, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "they're moving into position and the tennis racquet works this way like that", "start": 246.28, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "now what's that head doing as I begin to rotate the head of the racket actually goes back okay", "start": 253.439, "duration": 21.22}
{"chunk": "why that's showing that there's very low tension levels in the arm and the racket", "start": 264.49, "duration": 18.661}
{"chunk": "is actually trying to line up with the rotation so I'm going to do a little demonstration here I want to show you how physics really works on a on a bat", "start": 275.56, "duration": 16.878999999999998}

{"chunk": "and I start to spin or if it starts on the ground that object wants to line up okay now why is that an important thing", "start": 299.169, "duration": 17.581}
