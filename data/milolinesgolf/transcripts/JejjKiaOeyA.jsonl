{"chunk": "and spin it the same direction, it wouldn't turn much at all. So, with the feet, with spiral ground forces, that's the type of feeling I'm trying to get", "start": 75.119, "duration": 16.881}

{"chunk": "there was your chest. You got you reflexed and you really went down into here. Okay. Yeah, just like you would in", "start": 247.599, "duration": 15.919999999999998}

{"chunk": "premise I start with is the sequence from the ground upward to the appendages. And it's important to note", "start": 285.199, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "with that I don't care how hard you push that ball at the beginning of this. It's about how fast you can spiral that", "start": 293.44, "duration": 16.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "velocity and that force up through the hand and not just how hard you can shoulder press that ball up. If you shoulder press that ball up, what you're", "start": 301.84, "duration": 16.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "going to see is more of a drive off the right leg, more of a side bend with the right arm. And if we took that into your golf swing", "start": 310.16, "duration": 17.04}

{"chunk": "look at this this angle you're on. You got your sort of a bend here from the the hips. Your shoulders are still on an incline, right? And like you said, your", "start": 415.44, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "hips have fully opened up, fully released. And let me point out something from a movement perspective that I see with", "start": 425.28, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "this. When people's hips move forward, the shoulder that that plane flattens out a lot. So, this is crucial with the", "start": 433.599, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "golf swing. and maybe not talked about enough in my opinion from a movement perspective is how important it is to have a lot of of flex in your hips. So", "start": 441.759, "duration": 20.161}
{"chunk": "that way when your pelvis does turn, these tilts happen naturally. And that's something we're trying to achieve with exercises with a ball implement. So it's", "start": 452.08, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "important to keep in mind when you do it, you do it so well cuz you're not like this. Your first move is actually your butt sort of sitting down.", "start": 461.599, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "you reflexing your knees and you get that flex in the hips. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Cool. Um, another one.", "start": 470.4, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "This one it can get kind of tricky. The first part of the motion is to do a a keg toss. And here we're going low down", "start": 480.16, "duration": 19.198}
{"chunk": "and we're throwing that ball clear up to the sky. So that's the drill. Now the exercise that I like to use is to incorporate that spin with the feet. So,", "start": 490.319, "duration": 19.522000000000002}
{"chunk": "this ball is going to go up over my left shoulder and kill somebody. Yeah. So, you you guys need to find a place that you can do this safely. Maybe", "start": 500.08, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "not at your public a hole in your ceiling. Don't do this at your your public commercial gym cuz you might you might get somebody. Go to your backyard or", "start": 508.24, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "something. But, we're going to load down to the right. We're going to create that spinning force. You see the momentum of this ball is already moving up in a", "start": 515.68, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "spiral and it should just continue right up that. So, here's how it looks. Maybe that was a bad one. Try it again.", "start": 525.6, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "So, again, you're you've already said though, it's not necessarily about how high or how far the ball goes, at least at first. Yeah.", "start": 535.44, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "You're really just trying to create the right movement and pressure shifts and using the ground. If you guys are watching my feet,", "start": 543.04, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "they're spinning a long way, right? So, one thing I like to point out, too, is if we zoomed in here, you're going to see that he's tearing up the ground a", "start": 550.88, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "little bit. And when you watch long drive guys or like Bryson Shambo, they leave like footprints in the ground", "start": 562.08, "duration": 15.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "when they're on the range. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Now, you shouldn't do that on the putting green. Yeah. But when you do it on the range, if you're doing it, if you're using your pressures right, you're going to start", "start": 570.48, "duration": 17.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "to see some patterns here. Right. So, that's something that if they did these exercises and they really get the form right, they're going to start to feel", "start": 578.24, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "how to reflex, how to use the ground better to initiate the action they want, cuz a lot of people are just trying to spin. Yeah, I think so. And like I've said,", "start": 587.04, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "this is a a series of of medball drills that I've used with my professionals to really get them to feel the next step", "start": 595.92, "duration": 15.52}

{"chunk": "So, let me show you the last one. Now, [clears throat] this one's just a little bit more athleticy type of motion. Um, it's going to be a lunge into the right", "start": 611.839, "duration": 18.964000000000002}
{"chunk": "leg and then you're gonna jump and spin out of that. Um, it's the same principles with the feet. I'm just positioning you into a weird position", "start": 621.04, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "that you're probably not going to think about rotary jumping from. So, that's the motion. You got right leg lunge", "start": 630.24, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "forward, jump, spin to the left, and we just add So, you do right leg forward, not left leg forward. Correct. You guys are going to be", "start": 637.6, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "jumping towards the inside. Okay. And the feet are kind of working the same as they did on those spirals. So with the med ball, we're just going to", "start": 644.88, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "do something here. Now, could you do left leg forward or not? Sure. If you go left leg forward, you're just jumping up to the right. Yeah.", "start": 654.64, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "I just didn't know if you could go if you would go like that. I don't love to do this.", "start": 663.6, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "Um I I don't I can't really explain why. Extra worth it. the left leg doesn't clear as easily. Yeah.", "start": 671.44, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "As it should. Um or in comparison to the golf swing. Yeah. Um and I think that you would see that the more of a tendency for people to", "start": 680.56, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "jump forward rather than backwards. And if we're talking how this relates to golf, anything you do like this is no good.", "start": 689.44, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "Right. So that's our our classic early extension. Yeah. Um and that's why I don't like that one. So, I like always jumping towards the", "start": 698.16, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "inside, getting the hips to clear. And what what I think about most importantly is your pelvis staying in the same circle", "start": 706.399, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "that it gets to when you're down here. So, if you're watching from the side, you'd see my pelvis stay right in basically in the same spot, but everything else spins out of the way", "start": 716.16, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "from it. I think one other thing I [snorts] picked up on is with you doing these spiraling motions and and working", "start": 725.2, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "upward, right? I think there's a a thing that goes on in golf where you start to think that one, you need to hit", "start": 731.2, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "way down on the golf ball and that your hands need to travel way down. But when you look at the golf swing, the hands are actually traveling up and around us", "start": 739.6, "duration": 15.838000000000001}
{"chunk": "in the motion, right? Yeah. What creates the shaft lane is really what we talk about a lot is the right wrist extension, right? And the", "start": 747.839, "duration": 17.442}
{"chunk": "sequence, right? Mhm. When you do this, right, you're getting into a position like that", "start": 756.32, "duration": 18.0}
