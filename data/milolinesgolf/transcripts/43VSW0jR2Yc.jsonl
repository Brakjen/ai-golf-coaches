{"chunk": "to do at home they're probably sticking it back in their stance trying to hit it low and it doesn't work it's not going to go any lower and just throw more Loft at it play it more back", "start": 218.28, "duration": 19.739}
{"chunk": "and you swing it back really big turn get a little leaning on it okay and you're going to hit it back behind yourself there we go that's why it goes", "start": 228.0, "duration": 16.840000000000003}

{"chunk": "get scooped up okay the root cause is how you hold the golf club okay I want you to pretend that's a baseball bat hold that hold hold this end like", "start": 263.46, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "it's a bat it's I know it's real skinny but if a pitch was coming right here here comes a pitch you're gonna hit it boom see how your hands look leave your", "start": 272.4, "duration": 17.64}

{"chunk": "really good I could put your hands on however I want to put them on and you're going to figure out how to hit it kind of straight just like throwing a ball you can spin it right and make it curve", "start": 352.74, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "different ways the problem is it's going to go straight and straight up so let's just start with some bait some baby shots can I borrow that absolutely", "start": 360.66, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "so we're gonna get that grip I want to exaggerate I want you to take the handle and you're going to aim it right at your left thigh put that left hand on so you can see all four Knuckles okay", "start": 368.699, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "then get the right hand so it just sets on so it's pointing straight at your Target and then we're going to hit some little chip shots like this and see the height on that", "start": 377.52, "duration": 16.139}
{"chunk": "yeah I want to see if you can duplicate that and just hit me some little line drives with the seven iron handle pointing towards your left leg now left", "start": 385.56, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "hand a little stronger more can you see all four Knuckles on that left hand okay now right hand on the side good now you're just going to turn it back to", "start": 394.02, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "here and hinge it like this okay okay give me a little softness in that elbow good and then you're just going to turn and hit a little Chip Shot", "start": 402.66, "duration": 18.16}

{"chunk": "zipper good pretty high the face was open on that one the face was a little open so we're only taking it back to right here swing it back", "start": 432.419, "duration": 17.181}
{"chunk": "and then we're going to deliver it without using your hands just turn your left side kind of flex into the ground and turn your left side out of the way you're not gonna you're too high though", "start": 446.819, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "so you're gonna have to back here now feel like you fall into the ground a little bit now turn boom feel that yeah okay", "start": 455.039, "duration": 17.979}

{"chunk": "pretty hard but like even my off speed stuff was hard yeah you're taking it back to right here all turn so you're going to use your body to turn it to there there you go now use your body to", "start": 487.86, "duration": 18.5}
{"chunk": "turn it to the ball just let your body unwind so just turn it back to my hand I'm just going to put this here as a reference", "start": 496.56, "duration": 15.182}
{"chunk": "so you ran into me pretty hard so all turn all turn that's better try to stop before you hit the stick so", "start": 509.46, "duration": 16.360000000000003}
{"chunk": "you're going to turn change directions before you hit the stick and then just chip it out there like 10 feet in the air yeah that was good", "start": 522.659, "duration": 17.860999999999997}

{"chunk": "them off better that was close that was pretty good you can see the trajectory is way down on that yeah your hands turn but don't grip it real", "start": 552.12, "duration": 16.041}
{"chunk": "tight just grip it nice and light like a baseball like you're throwing it then just turn it back to here and then gently turn back into it", "start": 562.8, "duration": 18.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "what would happen if you rolled over a baseball like that yeah same thing Chopper to third right yeah", "start": 572.04, "duration": 15.958000000000002}
{"chunk": "okay stop give me that club I'm gonna make you use a stick in the grip so you're just going to hold this", "start": 584.7, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "like this and the idea here is see how it's resting on my left side that's the last time it touches you okay turn", "start": 591.779, "duration": 15.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "turn see how it's not touching me see if you can if you can do that without a ball first so it's touching you now doesn't touch you anymore turn", "start": 599.58, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "back the touch again okay don't let it touch it turn it back here and stop", "start": 608.399, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "I feel like we pointed a little more vertical like that okay now from there you're just gonna turn through see how it never touched", "start": 618.24, "duration": 17.539}

{"chunk": "without just flicking it out of the top hard oh there you go there we go backswing", "start": 655.62, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "wasn't crazy either yeah that's it okay so now take that away and do the exact same thing but gentle that that's going to be", "start": 663.3, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "your speed I'm not letting you go faster you can't go fast gentle fast is a given for you it's never going to go slow", "start": 672.24, "duration": 21.118000000000002}
{"chunk": "no strong that grip went weak again take your hands off now re-grip it with the hands where they feel like they're a little more under", "start": 681.959, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "not that much with the right right there you go voila feel that yeah", "start": 693.06, "duration": 15.44}

{"chunk": "anything else until you learn that a little stronger get the handle leaning forward before you grip it that left hand is not strong there we go", "start": 713.339, "duration": 16.94}
{"chunk": "good those ball positions forward and he's hitting it lower okay here we go game on that was fun yeah you learn anything", "start": 726.839, "duration": 17.981}
{"chunk": "yeah a lot okay there you go just recreate so remember you're using this hitting pattern just", "start": 740.1, "duration": 16.078}
{"chunk": "like baseball that's your golf grip see how that looks just now you can hit it with the same pattern the right hand is a little different because in baseball your right hand's", "start": 748.019, "duration": 17.761999999999997}
{"chunk": "under this one it's right there like that but that's really the only difference in in the grips okay perfect", "start": 757.56, "duration": 16.099}
