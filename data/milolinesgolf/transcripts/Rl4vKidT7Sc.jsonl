{"chunk": "a little different than a golf swing however a tennis player when he hits this forehand the racket", "start": 43.2, "duration": 18.9}

{"chunk": "swing the club back they've been taught that they need to keep their back to the target longer and get their arms moving down first okay so what does that", "start": 71.84, "duration": 18.07}
{"chunk": "actually create well that's going to create a look where when they get to impact their arms are gonna be both pretty straight their shoulders are", "start": 81.27, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "gonna be back to square so I'll show you that from this thing shoulders back to square arms fairly extended hips not", "start": 89.7, "duration": 16.348}
{"chunk": "very open and because of that the face is going to have more tendency to rotate the club's passing you too soon there's", "start": 96.899, "duration": 16.291}

{"chunk": "to be correct so it's going to work just like that baseball bat you're going to get it up and as in transition so now you've got you've put pressure into your", "start": 149.64, "duration": 17.43}
{"chunk": "right foot you move the pressure to your left foot now once the pressure hits the left foot immediately you go into rotation so I hear a lot of instructors", "start": 158.73, "duration": 15.9}
{"chunk": "say you want to feel like you stay closed well yes and no you want to stay closed until the pressure hits the lead foot and then you want to let everything", "start": 166.8, "duration": 15.57}
{"chunk": "open up as fast as you can just like that hitter if a hitter in baseball gets up here and opens up as they turn well they're not going to create any power and they're also going to drag the bat", "start": 174.48, "duration": 20.27}
