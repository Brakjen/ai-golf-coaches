{"chunk": "hey guys so today we're going to be talking about this Infinity swing that's going to help especially slicers out there from reducing some of that over", "start": 0.359, "duration": 18.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "the top sensation we're going to create a little bit of a different pattern a different Loop today so Milo what I've set up here is sort of a little station", "start": 9.059, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "now we use alignment sticks all the time and you'll have people kind of swing up and over things yeah create a different Loop right for sure so what I've done is", "start": 18.359, "duration": 20.219}
{"chunk": "I've put an alignment stick on the back end and the front end a little bit inside the ball line now we're going to", "start": 28.199, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "talk through a little bit how to set this up because we don't want people to hurt themselves these alignment sticks can go flying and things can happen we don't want that I've heard stories I've", "start": 36.42, "duration": 17.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "set it up so it's a little safer but what we're going to do is create this little Infinity swing okay now for many", "start": 45.059, "duration": 15.961}
{"chunk": "of you you tend to get a little in a little flat and then up and over so your Loop is more so they're this pattern yeah their pattern is under to over and", "start": 52.8, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "this is going to create kind of the opposite sensation right so that's what we're after okay so what I've done is again put these alignment sticks here", "start": 62.82, "duration": 17.579}
{"chunk": "we're going to create more of a up to under okay and we're going to do that with a little bit different pattern than maybe some people think we're going to", "start": 70.92, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "do it but this Infinity swing for anybody that does get over the top this is going to be a dramatic difference we're going to be starting to get that", "start": 80.34, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "club coming from the inside and actually hitting some draws maybe even some hooks which would be probably a nice little change for a little bit for many people", "start": 88.259, "duration": 15.301}
{"chunk": "that'd be welcome yeah so when you have somebody that comes to your range for a lesson with you and is struggling with that slice or maybe they're hitting", "start": 96.0, "duration": 16.379}
{"chunk": "really big pulls what kind of station do you set up is it something like this would you say oftentimes oftentimes I I", "start": 103.799, "duration": 15.001000000000001}
{"chunk": "just break out and I use other tools like a big long pipe or a hockey stick and I put people through some patterns where they're basically making Infinity", "start": 111.42, "duration": 17.158}
{"chunk": "type patterns with a different Implement so that they can start to feel oh that's different yeah and then I put the golf club back", "start": 120.479, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "in hand and start applying the same Sensations to golf yep well I know having watched you coach plenty of", "start": 127.979, "duration": 16.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "lessons I see you liking to see sort of a little Loop in pretty much any practice drill I see from for 90 percent", "start": 136.26, "duration": 17.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "of students because 90 percent go the other way yeah right so creating a loop where they stand it up and then shallow it out so it comes from", "start": 144.78, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "the inside that would be a totally different pattern yeah for most people that's the opposite of what they do exactly show us how to", "start": 154.26, "duration": 16.26}
{"chunk": "do it yeah so I've again set up two sticks one's kind of pointing back to you guys the camera and one is sort of pointing towards the target so they're", "start": 162.12, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "actually angled away we'll do a face on in a little bit it's kind of like you're sitting in a half pipe sitting in half pipe yes so it's kind of", "start": 171.3, "duration": 15.741}
{"chunk": "matching The Arc of the Swing more or less so it's about I don't know two Club heads inside of that that ball line we", "start": 182.099, "duration": 15.901}
{"chunk": "didn't get too exacting here but it kind of gives us a good reference and you'll see it on the camera I think this sort of loop we're trying to create so what I", "start": 190.14, "duration": 15.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "do I'm just going to hover one I'm not going to hit one quite yet but I want to show the loop so I'm going to set up pretty neutral I got a couple alignment", "start": 198.0, "duration": 15.659}
{"chunk": "sticks as reference and then I'm going to turn to the left so that'll bring the club actually inside this little yellow alignment stick so I'm kind of like", "start": 205.319, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "getting into impact and then just pass so exit we'll call it it's actually a little more left than it will be in the full swing I don't want", "start": 213.54, "duration": 17.939}
{"chunk": "to get two going left but this is going to help me catapult this club up and over this back stick okay so it's going to be standing up it's going to help you", "start": 221.819, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "load the club a little more out than you normally would versus so many of you are more inside flat you get your shoulders", "start": 231.239, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "like this right we don't want that so it's going to be a little in and then up now the key thing here too is this loop", "start": 238.44, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "we're about to create there's a few ways you can do it you can do it with your arms okay there might be a little of that in there but not it's not drastic we don't", "start": 247.62, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "want a ton of that we want it to more or less happen with our wrists and our bends yes okay so the", "start": 256.56, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "combination of those two that's going to help keep the face a little more Square to closed again", "start": 263.82, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "a big difference for most people to get it too open coming down for sure okay so so a little more of the wrist so there's", "start": 271.86, "duration": 19.859}
{"chunk": "going to be a little bit of radial but a lot of extension too in that right wrist like we talk about so it's going to be that stand up", "start": 281.52, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "getting in left Bend and then transition now I'm going to bounce get my chest down into right Bend and then have that", "start": 289.56, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "Center Mass kick back okay all while that face staying pretty Square pretty Square yep okay so again you know start", "start": 297.479, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "to left up and over that alignment stick you see that face is actually pretty strong yep that's different for a lot of people too", "start": 306.12, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "well stand it up sit and turn now that club has now looped over and around", "start": 314.04, "duration": 18.817999999999998}
{"chunk": "that orange stick yeah so it went over and now it's inside of so this is half my Infinity yep okay I actually started", "start": 323.039, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "at the front side of this Infinity up and over back down and in and now I'm gonna have", "start": 330.419, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "the club follow me to the right and my club is actually going to finish what's going to feel like up and over this yellow lineman stick yes okay so it's", "start": 337.8, "duration": 20.46}
{"chunk": "more of that draw pattern it's going to be completely different for some of you guys we should see the ball start right and turn left so", "start": 348.419, "duration": 19.26}
{"chunk": "do I really finish my Infinity probably quite not on the front end it more or less might look like one of those ribbons you might wear yeah right", "start": 358.02, "duration": 17.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "but that's the feel so in to the left kind of get that impact feel and then it's going to help", "start": 365.96, "duration": 15.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "you toss it up and out and then under to the right and then hit a little push draw okay so you're the master I want to see", "start": 374.4, "duration": 17.699}
{"chunk": "you do it okay that path was really nice and end out so Club here up and over and into hell yeah", "start": 383.52, "duration": 19.841}
{"chunk": "we got a hooker the opposite of what I normally hit but yeah I fixed you", "start": 397.139, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "I'm fixed I really see in transition your hands in the club head kind of feeling back to your right yeah they", "start": 413.72, "duration": 15.501}
{"chunk": "definitely feel like they toss so it's kind of back into the back over here yeah you definitely feel like the club goes from", "start": 422.1, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "kind of above your hands to behind your hands yeah and then you can just tow it on through yes and that's why again that club", "start": 430.5, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "doesn't race on left in the exit it'll still appear face or down the line that the handle is going around the left", "start": 439.62, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "it's not you driving the handle out here no the club head's coming up just swinging from behind out to the front so", "start": 448.979, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "for those of you at home they're thinking you need that handle to go low left be careful that can cause some of that over and out from the top the", "start": 457.38, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "handle going low left is just an effect of good pivot yeah my hands being brought along and in my normal", "start": 465.9, "duration": 15.78}
{"chunk": "swing that's going to be more prevalent than in this pattern this is a nice exaggeration to get me out of another Yeah a different pattern", "start": 473.58, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "all right Milo so now we can see it from face on clearly these alignment sticks we probably got this one the back end a good yard away front end maybe they're", "start": 485.22, "duration": 18.419}
{"chunk": "far enough away that I really can't hit them we want to make sure you guys do not get these too close where you could", "start": 494.639, "duration": 15.842}
{"chunk": "hit them these things go flying we do not want that we want any of these drills you guys do at home like gotta be careful with these lime is six they can", "start": 501.72, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "get tossed around so and they're sharp and they can hurt so anyway so here's kind of your station you can see how more or less you kind of got your swing", "start": 510.78, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "Arc here right yeah so let's see if we see anything from face on if you want to hit one again I'll get out of the way", "start": 519.899, "duration": 16.421}
{"chunk": "that was a really good one it's about perfect from this angle again it looks like to me in transition especially those like the hands are kind", "start": 530.82, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "of staying to your right but especially the club head yeah the club head really feels like because it went from in to up", "start": 539.94, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "it feels like it it goes this way yeah so for many that Loop is totally opposite of what they're doing at home", "start": 546.959, "duration": 16.020999999999997}
{"chunk": "yeah so here's a good drill for that you've probably seen our Looper video I'll tag that at the end of this video so you can watch that one too but this", "start": 555.66, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "Infinity swing might be a nice little thing to mix into your practice if you struggle with pulls and slices and heel", "start": 564.779, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "strikes yeah and because you've started with the club out in front you get to use momentum to direct the club into the arc you want it where most people get", "start": 572.94, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "off track they set the club in here and they get off track in the first foot of the backswing yeah so this gets you kind of energizing the system early and helps", "start": 580.98, "duration": 18.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "you sort of toss that club up and over this first stick and because we've started with a little in here naturally it wants to travel more out in front of you on the", "start": 590.58, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "backswing yeah which then gives you the freedom to Loop it under hey guys I hope you like this video and I want you to keep in mind that drills like this", "start": 599.04, "duration": 19.380000000000003}
{"chunk": "are not medicine for everyone some people need the exact opposite feels and that's why we've created our Online Academy so if you're not already a", "start": 608.7, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "member come on over join where you can get some one-on-one coaching from us and you can get infinitely better oh yeah", "start": 617.1, "duration": 15.94}
