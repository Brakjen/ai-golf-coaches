{"chunk": "we're live okay so what are we trying to accomplish here so i came in you know better", "start": 4.96, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "hands forward but wanting to go out to right field okay so your hands were going to the right yeah so what have we done to", "start": 13.2, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "fix it tried to go stay out over the ball and go low left okay so hands go more low and more around to the left so we've had the drill where you got the", "start": 21.6, "duration": 19.362}
{"chunk": "noodle here and you're forced to go around here and hatched up with", "start": 32.96, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "instead of rotating the forearms it's like the arms are on a tabletop and so the wrists are", "start": 40.079, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "releasing like that so you match that up yes", "start": 51.68, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "you're looking at the club face from my camera view versus the looking at the club face turned at the ground", "start": 67.04, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "yeah okay let's see it hit one like that we should get this a little soft cut and we did hallelujah", "start": 73.6, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "[Applause] what did we learn about setup first of all well we learned setup wise i was going", "start": 90.63, "duration": 15.610000000000001}
{"chunk": "to get out here and when the club is up here at impact it's more towards the neck yep so you", "start": 98.56, "duration": 16.398}
{"chunk": "have to so i have to like adjust so you're a little farther away so that it's set up when that it looks a little towie when the ball club's on the ground but then when it", "start": 107.119, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "elevates it's right on the money yeah okay perfect and then the next piece of the puzzle was we learned that", "start": 115.119, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "the impact i need to feel back so the arms extend so you've got to feel like you're pushing your chest back so that you have", "start": 125.52, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "somewhere to extend the arms into right yeah yeah and then you can go around the corner with it because you were tending to float forward slightly and drag the handle", "start": 134.8, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "forward and then you missed right with the driver everything else was pretty good but the driver was going right the key to the whole thing is as we're coming down", "start": 143.36, "duration": 16.718}
{"chunk": "we can't move this way yeah if i move like this there's no way that face is ever catching up i have to yeah see that yeah and that allows me so", "start": 150.959, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "i'm angled in a straight line away from this ankle like this if i get up in here my path goes too far", "start": 160.64, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "right and you drag the handle forward and hit a ball right okay you think of this straight line but this is a straight line up the", "start": 168.8, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "yeah but you've got to get turned so your body's open like that there you go that's how you want to feel", "start": 176.879, "duration": 16.642}
{"chunk": "up dead straight okay okay we're going so for me if i'm gonna hit a fade around a tree or something the first thing i do is i aim the face", "start": 189.04, "duration": 15.278999999999998}
{"chunk": "where i want the ball to start so if i'm going to go to that red flag but i got to start it out somewhere between the red and the green that's where the facing", "start": 198.879, "duration": 16.722}
{"chunk": "then the second piece of the puzzle i do is i aim my body more left than that and now my my goal is to swing the club", "start": 207.2, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "along my body lines but let that face stay pointed where i want that ball to start if i can do that", "start": 214.72, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "i can get this golf ball to go out there and have some bend in it yeah like that was pretty good right there that almost looked like i knew what i was doing", "start": 221.92, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "you've done that before okay and then i do the exact same thing but reversed for hitting draws so if i needed to go around a tree", "start": 233.04, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "now i'm going to aim the face out to the right then i'm going to aim my body a little bit more right than the face now i just swing where my body", "start": 242.64, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "is pointed and that should send that ball yeah drawing around the tree oh that was a good one okay so", "start": 250.48, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "that way i only have to make one swing okay further the bodies farther left now you just swing the club along the body lines", "start": 262.96, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "yeah let the face stay where it's at and what did you get beautiful little baby stage around towards the target there perfect", "start": 270.479, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "now let's see you go the other way with it so get the face aimed kind of at that bunker out there that's where you got the bunker okay now get your body lined", "start": 285.68, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "up there we go now take your grip now swing it along the body line yeah we got a little draw on that one", "start": 293.759, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "that's how you hit the straight ball the third try times the charm i want to see this one hook a little bit so you're going to need to you might need to release it a little", "start": 307.68, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "bit more yeah okay [Applause] okay so let's swing it out down your", "start": 321.84, "duration": 16.751}
{"chunk": "body line and let it release [Music] there we got one it's bending in", "start": 334.96, "duration": 20.88}
{"chunk": "the working ball when i'm hitting a finesse wedge shot i like to feel like i'm staying nice and tall through the whole swing so that", "start": 346.08, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "naturally these angles release because in my full swing there's a little bit more loading and a lot more pivot which holds angles for", "start": 356.8, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "me so this is the opposite i feel like i'm just going to stay tall and let the club release naturally like", "start": 366.479, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "that and i'm not really accelerating the unit very much so i want to see you hit one that was like what a 30 yard shot i just yeah yeah and you can tell when you do it", "start": 375.199, "duration": 20.319}
{"chunk": "right because there's really no divot and the club face and everything releases the same way same way only it's happening sooner yeah", "start": 385.039, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "okay yep just like that a little scuffy on the bottom yeah you", "start": 398.319, "duration": 20.322000000000003}
{"chunk": "kind of bounced into it a little bit [Music]", "start": 414.88, "duration": 15.229000000000001}
{"chunk": "yeah that was nice right there it felt a little thin but it was really nippy but it was really nipped yeah", "start": 427.68, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "that's how when you listen to the tour players most of their shots when they hit these little wedge shots it sounds a little low on the face yeah yeah it is a little low on the face", "start": 437.199, "duration": 21.282}
{"chunk": "that's where they hit them yeah there you go that sounded perfect feel that yeah so if i take the", "start": 445.68, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "i've got it on so yeah if i have the face square here now i open the face up the loft naturally wants to point off to the right but if i lower the handle down", "start": 463.12, "duration": 15.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "i can still get that loft point straight so when we were hitting the high lob there's some keys to it", "start": 471.36, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "first thing is we're going to open the face just slightly but then from here we're going to start to get the handle down so in order to accommodate that we're going to", "start": 478.56, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "flex into the ground a little bit more and then the release is still going past like this we want to let that club", "start": 488.08, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "swing yeah so what kills most people is they get back here and they drive their arms forward like this ahead of the club that ball ball's gonna", "start": 497.199, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "shoot off to the right yeah probably gonna shake it too so we're down and then we just let the club", "start": 505.52, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "fling and release and get that nice high soft thing yeah so this is kind of like a bunker shot it's very similar to a", "start": 512.479, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "bunker shop where you get further away from it and lower lowering the handle and yeah i say okay so a little bit", "start": 522.479, "duration": 21.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "open yep and let that club release and then that was good when you get on tape right there so first one you drop kicked it", "start": 532.24, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "so it's just hitting behind it yeah so your your center drop back you've got to make sure your center stays on top of the ball as well", "start": 549.44, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "it's a tough one to get under it right here there's not much cushion under the ball a little more fish on here my daughter is coming because michigan closed down", "start": 561.6, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "she's driving that's yeah so to me if i'm going to hit a real soft floater i like to make a great big swing and", "start": 573.519, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "feel like i let off the gas so i'm see how the the handle actually slows yeah yeah that'll produce a ball that comes", "start": 590.88, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "out wow it's a beauty right there great big swing not much distance yeah so this is like pretty couples kind of", "start": 602.839, "duration": 23.64}
{"chunk": "rhythm pain stewart yeah freddie ernie you know a lot of the best pitchers of the ball they have real soft looking motions", "start": 613.76, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "just kind of lazy looking and i don't mean that he didn't still had too much acceleration", "start": 621.36, "duration": 21.44}
{"chunk": "and your club is going to be a lot harder to get under that ball you have a that's like a 12 bounce right big old wide sole it is a 12 ounce yeah", "start": 633.12, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "yeah that that wide sole is going to be tough to get under that ball you need to have a little cushion under", "start": 640.32, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "it there you did pretty good right there i think that's about as good as you can do with that club let me try one with it based on the width of your sole yeah", "start": 658.839, "duration": 22.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "if you make a normal motion that's what you're gonna get just like you did yeah so you could you could adapt", "start": 675.44, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "to this club but what you're gonna have to do is get a lot of weight forward and bang it into the ground a lot harder so it's going to feel like", "start": 685.279, "duration": 19.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "i can't hit the soft one that i hit yeah i can't hit with this club not possible the sole is too wide so this is supposed to be strictly for", "start": 694.24, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "like bunker so the 54 has only got well it's got 12 too yeah but it's got a grind on it so you've taken some of the", "start": 703.2, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "trailing edge off so you could actually hit a softer lob shot with that than you probably could with your 60.", "start": 712.0, "duration": 23.519}
{"chunk": "even though the yeah yes", "start": 717.519, "duration": 31.32}
{"chunk": "milo's wedge for our chip shot the way we started out", "start": 745.76, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "yesterday is i had you hitting one handers because i like to feel the weight of the golf club work i like to feel it swing and so to me if", "start": 767.92, "duration": 19.518}
{"chunk": "if you can sit here and hit little crisp one-handed shots like that then you've got the club working correctly", "start": 777.279, "duration": 15.042}
{"chunk": "so then we put both hands on and the goal was to get the club to swing and it feels like it releases and it", "start": 784.24, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "points back right at your hip so it's something like that yeah so you're hitting just little chip shots that release and the club's pointing", "start": 792.639, "duration": 29.441}
{"chunk": "right there at your hip", "start": 802.0, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "common denominator is the face is doing the same thing yeah the face is still just working the exact same way as it did on uh the pitches and the full swing yeah", "start": 815.2, "duration": 18.678}
{"chunk": "we're not letting that face really twist much so i guess here you also want to feel tall yes on my chip shots i like to feel like i stay", "start": 824.639, "duration": 15.561000000000002}
{"chunk": "tall yeah i start sinking into the ground i start digging which not very good", "start": 833.279, "duration": 20.08}
{"chunk": "good a little bit bigger there you go nice little chip all right now we put the left handle on", "start": 842.48, "duration": 18.378}
{"chunk": "[Music] yeah exactly you want to feel like ricky fowler looks", "start": 856.61, "duration": 25.158}
{"chunk": "a little smaller swing there you go perfect there it is", "start": 873.44, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "you", "start": 905.44, "duration": 2.079}
