{"chunk": "hey everybody welcome out to superstition mountain milo and henry here on a extremely hot day we got something in front of us", "start": 0.24, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "what is that thing skateboard a skateboard what in the world does that have to do with golf oh that's what we're here for", "start": 9.28, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "okay well let's get into it so henry we were just inside and you were showing", "start": 22.16, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "me some video of a snowboarder doing some cool tricks and a half pipe and how him he moved sean white shawn white he's pretty olympic gold medalist", "start": 29.439, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "pretty studly on a snowboard yep he's also a good skater too i'm sure he is so this this video is not just about skateboarding we're going to", "start": 39.2, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "talk about surfing snowboarding all some similarities here just different uh seasons i guess yeah and they're all boards that you ride yes and i stink at", "start": 46.64, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "all of them so i have no idea how to skate i just tried to flip this up to myself and i almost killed myself that was pretty good though", "start": 56.8, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "okay cool so what are some of the things that we saw that were similar when the guys were riding those boards so i saw as he was he was coming into a half pipe and as he got ready to do a trick i saw", "start": 64.72, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "something he went like this so he was riding his board like this and then he got he started to go up the half pipe and he went into the ground like this getting ready to do a cool trick", "start": 73.68, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "well you have a term for that and you use this recently in another video what what term is that for getting in back into the grounds for", "start": 83.759, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "this reflexing reflexing right so sort of that sam sneed look that little bit of the squat squat it's something that athletes", "start": 91.759, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "do in every sport when they get ready to be athletic so if i'm getting ready to guard somebody in basketball i'm going to go down like that i hit her in baseball", "start": 99.92, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "they load down a pitcher when they're getting ready to throw they load down it's kind of what you what we do in order to make force", "start": 108.96, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "we load down so perfectly obvious or perfectly reasonable that in a sport like skating to be able to", "start": 117.84, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "jump because you have to you have to be able to jump to be able to make that skateboard get off the ground you have to go down into the ground", "start": 127.36, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "first now let's talk a little bit about some of the differences we saw though because i think the the obvious one when", "start": 135.44, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "we looked at it at slow motion with sean white on the snowboard which i'll put up in this video is where this sort of movement begins okay", "start": 144.16, "duration": 19.278}
{"chunk": "so his feet are strapped into the board first of all right so what we saw is in order he started to push with his legs out of the ground but he used his upper", "start": 154.319, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "body for the rotation so his hips didn't lead the way right in this scenario it was the opposite it was more of an upper body", "start": 162.72, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "lead motion yeah it kind of looked like his his shoulder his left shoulder after he started this this flex into the", "start": 171.12, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "ground the shoulder was the was really catapulting him into his spin uh-huh all right so it's more that way", "start": 179.2, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "versus golf is more from the from the middle up and down yeah this was more from the middle up and then the legs kind of got pulled", "start": 187.76, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "into the motion right i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that his feet are strapped the feet are strapped in and you can't move them well", "start": 196.879, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "and especially like on a skateboard where you really you have to create a stable base you cannot let the skateboard fly off and", "start": 204.4, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "kill something you know so it's you're trying to create um or maintain some of that friction there still right for sure", "start": 212.4, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "and so it was kind of a backward sequence it would be more of an over-the-top sequence and for a golfer top down yeah right so this goes back to your video", "start": 220.64, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "you've done one before about the upper center and the lower center and how they sort of sequence and match up right so this you're saying is almost the", "start": 229.76, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "opposite it would be reversed so in a in a golf swing or in most stick sports you see the lower half moves and pulls the upper", "start": 238.239, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "half along and they actually even kind of separate for a second the lower half goes for a bit and then the upper half catches up", "start": 247.519, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "and this scenario was kind of reversed the upper half went and got ahead of the lower half and then the lower half went spinning okay but again that's kind of because the", "start": 256.479, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "feet in a way are sort of pinned yeah so if you if you want to have bad sequencing and golf just make your feet really planted", "start": 265.52, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "and it'll probably cause you to do some things out of order so but as far as the the main similarity we", "start": 274.24, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "saw it was sort of that reflex and getting into the ground and using our core to kind of initiate that rotation i know it was from top", "start": 282.72, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "down versus bottom up but it's still that's what created that spin it was it was in here in that movement right", "start": 290.639, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "so um one other thing like i i kind of like the the feeling and sensation of this half pipe so if you imagine this", "start": 299.759, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "this half pipe and i'm kind of making my way into it you can see how that in a way in itself i'm starting to", "start": 307.68, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "turn the corner right and sort of come up and out of the shot in my finish so yeah so", "start": 315.68, "duration": 15.278000000000002}
{"chunk": "that can be kind of like riding right in the wave or the half pipe yeah yeah cool so that can be kind of a cool visual for folks at home so there are", "start": 323.199, "duration": 17.762}
{"chunk": "some similarities in riding a skateboarding golf it's it's an athletic motion and those skateboarders man they're they're crazy good athletes it's are you", "start": 332.4, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "going to hit a ball off this skateboard oh i don't think that's a very good idea probably not but i will hit a golf ball all right well show us how", "start": 340.24, "duration": 18.477999999999998}
{"chunk": "golfers should do it what actually you know what show us the wrong way to do it the way a skateboarder would do it so skateboarder would be", "start": 351.68, "duration": 17.357999999999997}
{"chunk": "top first so it would look like that that's pretty good coordination to make it go straight though", "start": 359.919, "duration": 15.361999999999998}
{"chunk": "good hands man and a golfer would make it the opposite so it's more legs pelvis and legs first", "start": 368.08, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "and you can see there's a lot more energy that gets into the golf club head like that but i'm not i'm not very good at being that way that way that's that's probably", "start": 378.24, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "why i'm really bad on a skateboard i never skateboarded really but i was more of a skier growing up honestly so i'll have to do a skiing one okay", "start": 386.16, "duration": 16.8}
