{"chunk": "in the middle I'm going I'm flexing into it okay so that's where the hips are are flexing and then I'm feeling like that", "start": 694.32, "duration": 15.399999999999999}
{"chunk": "goes down and back and then it pulls around behind you and gives you room for your arms to shoot so that road map would be down and back so you see that", "start": 701.48, "duration": 18.719}

{"chunk": "that way on that angle it's nice and slow back way okay so that's a really good tool you can use very similar to the PVC pipe", "start": 728.519, "duration": 20.121}
{"chunk": "where we pushed back um this gives you a good visual cuz it's right on you and it's pretty easy right this one easier to set up there you go so if you guys", "start": 749.36, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "don't have a Gbox maybe look into one we'll tag it above but really loved how that made me push back and again it creates such a nice like flow to it too", "start": 758.16, "duration": 16.361}
