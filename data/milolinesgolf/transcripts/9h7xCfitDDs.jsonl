{"chunk": "set this this hanger up a little different than most or at least different than how it's designed. It's designed with a face on it. And I", "start": 20.08, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "actually like to set the fa the face slightly open. Mhm. So that when I take my right hand grip, the hanger just rests right on my right", "start": 27.599, "duration": 17.521}

{"chunk": "set it up a little bit differently than maybe some other people set it up. So I I want to just go back to that point. So you set it a little open", "start": 63.44, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "so you can get that wrist to go into extension. Something we talk about all the time, right? So I set it open so I can get my trail wrist into extension.", "start": 72.64, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "Not really a radial hinge. So, I want to see more of an extension type hinge like this than I do a vertical hinge. Something I think a lot of people at", "start": 81.439, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "home think when they hinge the club that it's like that right there. Right. Yeah. And that's it was taught for a long time. I taught it for a long time,", "start": 90.56, "duration": 16.241}

{"chunk": "extension right away or earlier. So it's not as much this as it is this. And like we've talked about before, we have a video too on sort of like", "start": 115.84, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "different takeaways, right? Some three different takeaways. We've seen we've seen kind of an early hinge, a one piece, and actually a later hinge. So by you having it on the right forearm, you", "start": 124.079, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "can actually do all three of those. Yeah. Yeah. I could I could have almost no hinge going the other way and", "start": 133.04, "duration": 15.76}

{"chunk": "Yep. And when that hinge happens now, this little rod here, the curve of this hanger starts to ride up your for your left forearm.", "start": 147.84, "duration": 16.559}

{"chunk": "you need to do is add in the extension in the trail wrist and that takes my left wrist from kind of an extended position and", "start": 165.84, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "flattens it out and that puts the rail right on my my left arm. Yeah. So, I think one important key here is as we", "start": 175.36, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "talk about these wrist conditions and you hear all the time about matchups, right? So, the grip plays a role in in what's going on here. But", "start": 185.519, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "overall, we still want the wrist to be moving in this fashion, right? We don't need too much of this, and you don't need too much of this. Unless maybe you", "start": 194.0, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "have a little bit of that setup. But theoretically, even if you had a weaker grip, it would still move this way. It would just be a little more bowed, like we talked about.", "start": 202.64, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "I could put my hand on in a weak fashion. And now, as I swing it back to get it onto my forearm, you can see my left wrist is now kind of bowed. Yeah. And", "start": 211.36, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "that's just the relationship between my right and left is instead of having my left hand on strong, my left hand's on weaker, but my right hand's kind of in", "start": 220.72, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "the same spot. Mhm. And that's generally what we see on tours. Most people's right hands are fairly similar. There are there's some", "start": 229.92, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "variation, but it's not that drastic. But the left hands Yeah. they vary quite a lot. I There's guys whose left hands on like this and guys", "start": 236.48, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "whose left hands on like this. Yeah. So, you know, it's but the right hand generally matches more or less the face.", "start": 245.92, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "Small amounts, but not like you don't see anybody with the right hand under or really over. Yep. Cool. All right. So, we've kind of made our way through the takeaway here. Let's go up to like P3,", "start": 254.239, "duration": 19.921}

{"chunk": "whole lot happening through here. Just stable. And it's hard I I will say it's hard the first few swings to really get that", "start": 321.68, "duration": 16.719}
