{"chunk": "in order to do that we're looking to create as much speed and force as we can so what we're using is we're getting", "start": 55.08, "duration": 15.169}
{"chunk": "pressure and force into the ground we're driving our body and at impact we're hitting the golf ball with our right arm lined up the angle of our wrist laid", "start": 62.33, "duration": 21.930999999999997}

{"chunk": "pitch shot they're actually almost standing up through the ball you why is that", "start": 98.28, "duration": 17.819000000000003}
{"chunk": "now the main reason is they're looking to unload all the angles that are created and go in the pitching motion so we know that in the full swing we're", "start": 135.349, "duration": 19.2}
