{"chunk": "catapult system so they create lots of speed so ed let's just kind of open this up a little bit and walk", "start": 39.04, "duration": 16.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "through this topic been noticing recently is that when you get people to transition from their trail side to their lead side quite", "start": 47.039, "duration": 20.159}
{"chunk": "often uh when they land left um they're not using their lead side correctly and so what happens is is that their hip gets on top of their knee and their hip", "start": 56.559, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "goes straight up well the only thing they can do then is go straight down and not create any rotation so for what you're hiding go ahead well let me just kind of walk", "start": 66.799, "duration": 18.162}
{"chunk": "through this and you can tell me if this looks like what you're seeing so they they swing back they fall to the left and then they just push up like", "start": 76.24, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "this when they do that we cannot rotate they can't rotate they have to throw the hands at the ball and then what we're what we're finding", "start": 84.479, "duration": 17.922}

{"chunk": "this arm up here the knee actually is outside the hip and this way they can actually use the push away is not so much up or straight", "start": 101.2, "duration": 17.839000000000002}

{"chunk": "do the same thing it's the way we create rotation in our human body so if if we're landing correctly and we're pushing away", "start": 135.76, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "from the target it actually creates that rotation and you don't feel compelled to throw it with your hands let me demonstrate with a baseball bat", "start": 144.56, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "because this is kind of a fun game for me so if i'm going to make this bat go fast and get my body to turn", "start": 153.84, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "when i land with my front foot like this i push back and around the corner like that is that kind of what you're talking", "start": 162.08, "duration": 18.319000000000003}

{"chunk": "you just collect the ball but you're out front i mean if that were the case if that were the case you would have both arms completely extended your chest pointed at the ball but because the", "start": 193.92, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "speed is out front you have some side bend your right arm right wrist are bent back a little bit you're more open and the speed is", "start": 201.76, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "out here so you've collected the ball and it's out here this is where the release happens and both arms are extended and it brings you into that nice finish", "start": 209.28, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "okay okay so so what we're talking about here the the push is actually kind of a circular push so it's going in a circle like this to", "start": 217.68, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "to help this club catapult is that does that make sense yes exactly so it's and it's not so much", "start": 226.4, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "that you're actually turning uh just in a complete round this direction either right it's it's not completely round this way and", "start": 234.879, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "it's not up and down this way it's up and around because we play on an angle so we're always fighting the club head for us is that", "start": 244.239, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "clubhead's moving that way our pelvis is always moving the opposite direction so we can continue to turn that's why this this hip has to turn that direction", "start": 253.04, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "it can't go up and it can't just go straight back because then you'll never yeah turn it's kind of like the have you ever seen one of those", "start": 262.4, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "catapults a trebuchet how they have a big weight that they can drop and then that creates the rotation of the everything else so that's kind of what", "start": 271.28, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "our body works like it's like a big counterweight that slings the club around and it works in an opposite force vector to the club so the club's working down and out at", "start": 278.96, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "that point in time we're pushing up and back and so on as the club gets out here we're pushing away from it and then once the club gets up here", "start": 288.479, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "then we can stand up and finish in that nice balanced finish 100 that's exactly what we do and that's what we're finding to be the most", "start": 297.28, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "successful um getting getting people to to get over here and get on top of that leg and then jump up and throw it that all that is is hand and arm speed right", "start": 306.08, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "here and you only have so much you would never throw a ball standing like this because you only have a very very limited speed you would always turn", "start": 316.24, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "and push away to throw the ball always awesome awesome so if we're going to boil this down as i'm", "start": 323.6, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "to in order for me to get this golf club moving first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to create a little bit of a trigger so i create some motion to the forward foot", "start": 333.28, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "and then away and then that motion begins to move the golf club and then the club works itself up to the top of my swing and the club is kind of hovering for a second as i start to", "start": 342.08, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "transition and unweight myself and fall back down and now the club's coming down down down so in order for me to get this club to", "start": 351.36, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "accelerate where i want it to i've got to now push not up up and back away is that what we're saying", "start": 358.96, "duration": 16.959}
