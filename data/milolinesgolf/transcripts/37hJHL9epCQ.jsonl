{"chunk": "let's talk about how we use our legs as brakes to create rotation in the golf swing all right so Milo legs is breaks", "start": 0.24, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "well in a in a a any athletic motion there is some amount of lateral motion going on if there was nothing to stop", "start": 8.8, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "the lateral motion it would just continue on mhm and it would never convert into a rotation what has to", "start": 17.08, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "happen in order to get my body to start to turn I actually use my trail leg as a a braking system to to stop the lateral", "start": 24.64, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "Motion in the back swing and then as I start to fall and land back to the left I have to actually use my my lead leg as", "start": 32.8, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "a a breaking force to stop me from wandering forward so this kind of I think we did a section on this in the", "start": 40.96, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "five Keys video that we did a while back I think it was sort of the how we're using the ground ground work so I think what I did was I actually put like an", "start": 49.239, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "alignment stick here mhm and Alignment stick somewhere over here just to show how the different Force vectors are", "start": 58.519, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "working here right so as you're pushing or falling into this right side that Force into the ground here is then", "start": 67.24, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "pushing you back and up yes right so I'm pushing into the ground this way which pushes my body backing up and then the same goes", "start": 76.08, "duration": 19.639}
{"chunk": "on this end so now you've kind of created that height and round because I pushed with my right leg that starts to send me over this way and now I'm going", "start": 86.479, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "to fall onto my left leg and now I've got to push this leg back and around mhm so both legs are", "start": 94.92, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "pushing into the ground kind of on a diagonal that way yeah ideally now there are players who move a little different than this who tend to push more", "start": 103.92, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "vertically that's because they have more lateral motion mhm my preference would be more of this having worked and stuff", "start": 113.2, "duration": 15.399999999999999}
{"chunk": "to me it kind of what resonates is a little bit like a speed skater action so when I do a speed skater exercise I'm", "start": 120.52, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "not going this way and falling over I'm not gliding into you no I'm not actually like on ice here right I'm still staying", "start": 128.0, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "sort of inside my columns we call it right so actually you see my knees too there's almost a slight bow to it uh-huh", "start": 136.8, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "so I'm my hips are staying somewhat inside my legs yeah ideally the hip sockets inside the ankle joints and the knees actually get bowed outside the", "start": 145.319, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "hips just slightly so that they can create this angular push back and away yeah okay so how does width of stance", "start": 154.64, "duration": 18.279}
{"chunk": "then come into this because I think it's important to realize that that appearance which I just showed kind of determin a little bit on how wide we", "start": 163.84, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "stand as well yes well width of stance is important the longer the golf club gets the wider The Stance needs to be to create the braking forces necessary to", "start": 172.599, "duration": 18.082}
{"chunk": "swing that longer stick M so with a wedge we don't need as much force we don't have to put as much energy into the golf club and with driver we need we", "start": 181.84, "duration": 15.719}
{"chunk": "want to swing it fast yep and the stick's really long and it's pulling a lot more so we need to create more energy backing away yeah to your point", "start": 189.76, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "though it's sort of getting your hip sockets out inside your ankles or at least on them that's kind of the look maybe we're going for is that what", "start": 197.959, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "you're saying yeah at least like wedge up we'll call it yeah wedge with wedges you can have your your ankles basically under your hips and then everything", "start": 205.599, "duration": 16.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "outside of that you're going to have your ankles outside your hips mhm and I think it's important too to talk about like with with taller people having that", "start": 214.4, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "wider stance can help you get down to the ball without using as much hip flexion at setup yes employ a little wider base and you'll be able to stay", "start": 222.64, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "fairly tall in your posture so you can get down to the ball more comfortably versus you know narrow and then bending over", "start": 231.84, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "over lot I'm not 65 so I can't make it look right but but you get the drift so but using our legs as brakes so the", "start": 240.4, "duration": 15.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "width of stance can be important you were saying there's actually there is a little bit of lateral the center mass is kind of moving a little bit right", "start": 248.239, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "generally we see the center of mass float a little bit in the early part of the back swing and then float a little bit in the early part of the the down", "start": 255.88, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "swing but the key is it floats for just a second and once Force hits into that foot we've got to start to push oursel", "start": 264.479, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "back to the back to the middle yeah so it kind of sounds like instead of thinking of like moving our chest lateral getting the chest back on top", "start": 272.68, "duration": 19.72}
{"chunk": "you're almost saying use your legs to kind of and your your Center and your lower body to kind of create that for you is that am I making sense there yeah", "start": 282.759, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "to some level that's what's going on it's like hitters in baseball they're using their legs yeah", "start": 292.56, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "loading into them and striding in that way and then once they land they don't push themselves over their front foot they use their front foot the front leg", "start": 299.759, "duration": 19.322}
{"chunk": "catapult them back pushes everything everything around the corner so their whole body goes up and around behind them like this yeah so for those of you", "start": 309.84, "duration": 17.238}
{"chunk": "that are looking for more centered action and maybe a little less of this sway slide Glide tilt any of that don't", "start": 318.319, "duration": 21.321}
{"chunk": "just use your your legs to move you laterally use them as brakes so you can then create that wind up and then land", "start": 329.039, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "and then unwind it yep right so that's kind of the look we're going for so what would be maybe a nice little drill or exercise we could do to it always this", "start": 337.68, "duration": 20.519}
{"chunk": "leads back to step drills one of my favorites is just to start with my feet together a little toss so I saw a little", "start": 348.319, "duration": 17.801}
{"chunk": "toss out to the Target first little toss forward so that gets some energy in the system using momentum", "start": 358.84, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "a little bit yeah and I like to that gives me that's kind of my trigger so I toss it forward and as the club's going forward I'm going to create a little", "start": 374.639, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "rightward step so you're countering the the movement of that club the club head and then I start to step back to the left while", "start": 383.84, "duration": 18.519}
{"chunk": "the club is going that way I'm countering it again yeah so I'm constantly countering the momentum I'm creating in the club so that's that", "start": 393.56, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "change of Direction that's that's the pitcher throwing the ball you're tipping the bat and then you're starting to land", "start": 400.599, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "as the bat is still my hands are are feeling like they're moving this way yeah that's the same thing as I'm doing", "start": 408.96, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "here and then you can start to make it a little bit less yeah of a step more like heel tap sort of and just feel like a little heel", "start": 417.68, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "tap and then a step with the left foot so you see this is creating some some energy in the positions we want a little more naturally versus sort of uh", "start": 426.36, "duration": 20.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "piecing it together yeah so I actually now that I see this bucket sitting here here's another great little feel they can get we've done we've done this with", "start": 439.56, "duration": 16.999}
{"chunk": "like kettle bells for sure so for me to kind of start moving this bucket and not wandering with it I'm", "start": 447.919, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "using my legs as brakes yep you know I'm countering that the bucket so as it's going up I'm kind of you see how I'm", "start": 457.28, "duration": 15.799000000000001}
{"chunk": "stepping to the right here up to the left step step I'm kind of fighting it and I can even start moving you know", "start": 465.72, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "away from it I could start moving towards it just to add another wrinkle to this and if you wanted to really throw that bucket and swing it hard yeah", "start": 473.479, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "what would you do swing it hard I would really push back in a way I feel like yeah exactly that's what we do with this thing too it", "start": 482.28, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "creates a lot of the club moving around you fast creates a lot of the forces that that bucket does yeah so we're kind of we're kind of fighting it again using", "start": 490.44, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "our legs as as brakes and staying in our columns a little bit so we're not getting too lateral which can really throw off your low point and things like", "start": 499.12, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "that so keeping that in mind as well so for sure okay everybody hopefully you like this video and found it educational if you did hit the Subscribe button hit", "start": 507.52, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "the Bell icon we want you to get all of our videos that we make also we'd love for you to come over to molines golf.com where we can actually coach you", "start": 517.76, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "oneon-one and help you understand what you need to work on in your golf swing", "start": 525.92, "duration": 11.04}
