{"chunk": "you're trying to get it to touch it won't it was not gonna get there but that's what you're feeling extended ly so here's a difference between here no good and and my right", "start": 28.11, "duration": 17.07}
{"chunk": "wrist being extended all the way back all right a little bit different [Music] [Music]", "start": 36.75, "duration": 20.59}
{"chunk": "all right Maya thanks for having us back out here my friend been a pleasure let's go and so we're gonna talk in today's video as we've been talking about how to", "start": 62.21, "duration": 17.23}
{"chunk": "start the downswing right and in this one about how the arms and hands work I know that at the top of the backswing and you know - and everyone knows", "start": 70.5, "duration": 17.249}
{"chunk": "players can be in different positions yeah but there's a couple things that we can say kind of in general good players will do across the board then there's", "start": 79.409, "duration": 16.711}
{"chunk": "gonna be some little nuances to start with what would be one thing you see across the board with good players that kind of a cross you know generally", "start": 87.18, "duration": 15.93}
{"chunk": "speaking they most all do so generally speaking and transition you're going to see their wrists working in a similar", "start": 95.61, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "similar direction yep so you know everybody's got a different grip and so that creates a little different structure at the top yeah but depending", "start": 102.96, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "on the grip you know you might have a little cupping or you might have a little bowing but from there everybody's going to be gaining more flexion in the", "start": 111.869, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "relatively speaking short more flexion in the lead wrist and more extension in the trail wrist I love that and certainly we've seen", "start": 121.22, "duration": 18.61}
{"chunk": "that measured right and then we see that in video before we dive into some of the other P's and how to do that let's just take a quick look at what some good players do in terms of that at the top", "start": 130.56, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "of their backswing to start the downswing what are the keys from the top of the backswing to start the downswing is going to be the wrist angle so if we", "start": 139.56, "duration": 17.939}
{"chunk": "take a look here in a few simple examples where look at the lead wrist angle kind of relative to the forearm and the trail wrist or how bent back", "start": 148.2, "duration": 18.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "that trail wrist isn't the general idea is gonna be as the transition and downswing happens that angle of that right wrist is gonna go from the angle", "start": 157.17, "duration": 15.21}
{"chunk": "that it's currently out however much it's bent back and it's gonna Bend back more so that trail wrist being closer", "start": 165.239, "duration": 15.091000000000001}
{"chunk": "the back of the trail hand being closer to the forum would be the movement powder we're looking at here and also the angle of the lead wrist relative to", "start": 172.38, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "the forearm and how that will judge us and we're talking small amounts here just slight increase in the amount of flex or the lead wrist working more towards bow left wrist working more", "start": 180.51, "duration": 18.628999999999998}
{"chunk": "towards flexion and the right wrist bending back more in transition those are the piece that we're talking about in terms of the wrist angles now let's", "start": 189.84, "duration": 17.661}
{"chunk": "talk Milo a little bit about the grip differences in risk conditions let's and let's keep it simple and call it like three types of grips so I'm gonna I'll", "start": 198.49, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "start with strong yeah so a strong grip you know something along those lines generally at the top of the backswing if we see a face that's fairly square we're", "start": 206.62, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "going to see some extension there's some extension in that we're cupping as some would say in that wrist okay if we go", "start": 215.86, "duration": 21.33}
{"chunk": "more neutral to have a square face we're gonna have the wrist closer to flap yep got it okay", "start": 225.7, "duration": 15.21}
{"chunk": "and if we're a weak grip get the face square you're gonna have some bow yeah", "start": 233.17, "duration": 15.329999999999998}
{"chunk": "some flexion and and so when you're at the top of those different grips obviously where you're your lead risk can be in different spots where it's", "start": 241.54, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "gonna be coming down to me a little different but the movement that's happening will be this so let's start with the let's start with a neutral grip okay let's say you took a neutral grip", "start": 250.959, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "to the top and you go up to the top and pause now to start the downswing with the hands with a neutral grip what's gonna happen with the lead wrist the", "start": 258.97, "duration": 17.310000000000002}
{"chunk": "lead wrist is going to work that direction right so that's that's working towards a flexion working towards flashes right toward flexion it doesn't", "start": 267.1, "duration": 17.671}
{"chunk": "mean it's in flexion or is bowed it's from wherever it is towards that way it's me yes it's getting more flexed got it perfect and let's do that over", "start": 276.22, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "time so with a neutral grip if this is flat and then working towards being bowed or flex because we hold it with two hands that also mean something to", "start": 285.22, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "have what the trail wrist right so it's getting more extended more extended or more bent back yes and then if we take let's go strong grip model so kind of", "start": 294.16, "duration": 17.37}
{"chunk": "overly turn let's say they're a little extended overextend at the top now we're and I'm just gonna make up right here let's say this is 30 degrees in", "start": 302.89, "duration": 17.549}
{"chunk": "extension whatever that is all we're saying is it's gonna lose some of that's gonna work towards flexion so it might still be in 15 degrees as you work down", "start": 311.47, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "but it's lost some of that yes it's worked towards the flexion part and same thing with the trail hand right exactly and then if we have the weak model we're", "start": 319.78, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "work on a boat already at the top same sort of thing it's already flex but I'm gonna go in more inflection as you work down more bent back with the with", "start": 328.27, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "the trail rest yes and so I think the point being it's a little bit dependent in terms of the grip where you're gonna", "start": 335.95, "duration": 17.01}
{"chunk": "be but more or less across the board for good ball strikers how to start the downswing is you want to work more towards the bow flexion and more towards", "start": 344.65, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "the extension of the trousers which tends to strengthen the face it makes it easier for you to do all the other things we want life is good let me hop in there for a sec Milo and let's say I", "start": 353.05, "duration": 16.009999999999998}
{"chunk": "have a neutral grip to start with okay and I'm at the top and I don't do those things let's say I work more towards", "start": 360.82, "duration": 16.09}
{"chunk": "copper or extension of the lead rest we know that shafts gonna be more vertical face more open nothing good", "start": 368.65, "duration": 15.75}
{"chunk": "coming out of this and but let's say I do that my right wrist gets flat my lead wrist gets extended and I say all right Milo I get it I want to be neutral what", "start": 376.36, "duration": 17.87}
{"chunk": "do i do how do I do that what do I feel you feel the opposite drastically okay so you feel the opposite right of what", "start": 385.57, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "you're currently doing and you exaggerate it 900 million times more than you think yes until you hit neutral okay I may have said that once or twice", "start": 393.94, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "before I love that feedback so if I'm here at the top and I want to feel these things I'm gonna feel my lead wrist working towards the bow or I'm kind of", "start": 402.49, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "feeling might leave my logo of the glove is pointing away yeah kind of more back towards the camera maybe I feel my knuckles kind of pointing more back", "start": 410.77, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "towards again a fingernail something little like that might work in terms of my trail wrist whatever like you're extending it to the max yeah like I'm", "start": 418.51, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "kind of getting this back of my hand back in my forearm you're trying to get it to touch it won't it was not gonna get there but that's what you're feeling extended me so here's the difference", "start": 427.33, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "between here no good and and my right wrist being extended all the way back all right a little bit different so really I'm gonna feel some of that", "start": 436.3, "duration": 15.39}
{"chunk": "happening as I begin my down side yes right feeling a little bit of that if I'm the player goes a little bit this way we already did some videos talking", "start": 444.25, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "about hey from the top we really want to see the lower body movement yeah bright excetera that's still all in play here still all", "start": 451.96, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "in play and if you're if stuff is in put in place and your hands are not tense most of what's happening", "start": 459.25, "duration": 16.549}
{"chunk": "with the club should kind of happen on its own also and and I think across the board this stuff if you do it right a lot of the boxes get checked yeah", "start": 468.81, "duration": 15.451}
{"chunk": "without you having to think about it and then what the player needs to do is work with a coach like you and say hey within these Oh your issue is this ok let's", "start": 476.49, "duration": 16.139000000000003}
{"chunk": "address that specifically all that other stuff still applies right but if I'm coming down for whatever reason and I have this tendency a lot of this other", "start": 484.289, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "stuff gonna be harder to do as well yeah you won't do it right ok so as I start here and I'm going to do some of these I'm gonna feel my lead wrist working a", "start": 492.3, "duration": 16.888}
{"chunk": "little bit towards flexing I prefer the trail wrist bent back feels personally but I'm gonna feel like that increases a little bit in transition and let's see", "start": 500.639, "duration": 18.301000000000002}
{"chunk": "if I can I want to skip the 75 yarder and see if I can go maybe 100 230 here so lead wrist flexing trail wrist bent", "start": 509.58, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "it's like back of my hand is bending back towards my form let's just do a little half one here yeah and that feels strong and how I", "start": 518.459, "duration": 15.021}
{"chunk": "personally know milah when I'm doing this stuff that I did that well is that ball Curt hooked more than normal mm-hmm based on my release pattern which", "start": 527.43, "duration": 16.529}
{"chunk": "is based on the face that's more neutral and what I like about this I know enough to keep doing that and then kind of get things more passive yet with the other", "start": 535.829, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "pieces but that to me was a nice sign that I actually did that same piece is here lead wrist more towards flex right wrist more bent back as I begin my", "start": 543.06, "duration": 17.431}
{"chunk": "downswing pieces let's go ahead and do one more of those yeah the same thing again that feels really strong and for", "start": 551.73, "duration": 18.330000000000002}
{"chunk": "anyone certainly who has a face or shaft that's out of position they would feel those exaggerations just to get the ball you know kind of more toward straight", "start": 560.94, "duration": 16.95}
{"chunk": "yeah generally yeah so that's the arms and hands part now let's pause for a second let's look talked a little bit about some of the other factors of where the arms and hands might be and have it", "start": 568.8, "duration": 19.38}
{"chunk": "affects the downswing all right - so risk conditions there in part 1 let's talk a little bit about the depth or where the hands in the butter Club are", "start": 578.67, "duration": 16.738}
{"chunk": "at the top and how that'll affect things on the way down perfect and so if we look at it like let's say neutral deep neutral is one option D", "start": 587.399, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "there's another option and maybe like someone who's super vertical okay so let's say someone who's deep so deep would be someone like probably rory", "start": 596.579, "duration": 17.551000000000002}
{"chunk": "mcilroy we're at the top of the backswing the butt end of the golf club is behind their heels yeah right right well that player naturally their hand", "start": 604.92, "duration": 17.55}
{"chunk": "Pat's gonna work more out here in front of them or it's going to need to yep if they want a neutral ball flight yep exactly the player who is more neutral", "start": 614.009, "duration": 21.470999999999997}
{"chunk": "grip of the club kind of somewhere between the heels and the arch of the foot yeah their hand path you'll still move out and work out in front of them", "start": 624.35, "duration": 17.137999999999998}
{"chunk": "but it won't have to be quite as drastic feeling yep out in front and the player who's very vertical like a Dustin", "start": 633.389, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "Johnson or a Bubba Watson you're gonna almost see their hands working this way as they turn so it's like their hands", "start": 640.769, "duration": 17.791}
{"chunk": "are making a loop and so if we look at that and a lot of that like the deep player right the Rory type of guy who gets the butter look of super deep and that part of the", "start": 649.47, "duration": 18.45}
{"chunk": "club if it goes back this way farther has to come back this way farther right yeah but a lot of that's gonna be happening from the body turn most of it", "start": 659.22, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "happens because of how the player turns the body yeah cuz the body turning moves the hands back out where you want so a player who got really deep on the way", "start": 667.619, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "back probably had a lot of body turn on the way back yeah most likely and so they're gonna have a lot they're gonna need more on the way through yeah right to get back to neutral the player who", "start": 676.829, "duration": 17.011}
{"chunk": "goes vertel vertical kind of with or without the body turns you go vertical a lot you can go a lot of turning away vertical like a Bubba Watson and you're", "start": 685.29, "duration": 15.39}
{"chunk": "still going to have the body motions to start back down but that lead arm and by the club obvious are gonna work a little they're gonna be yeah if I if I'm real vertical here like a bubble Watson er as", "start": 692.759, "duration": 18.990000000000002}
{"chunk": "I come down you can see my hands are actually going this if I didn't turn your hands are actually going this way to come down yeah and I think a good way", "start": 701.999, "duration": 15.928999999999998}
{"chunk": "to think about it can you go up to the top one more time I was just neutral neutral if we say as a stock swing I'd you do like do like a circle here and I was like hey the bone of the clubs gonna", "start": 710.819, "duration": 16.53}
{"chunk": "get back to here on the way down well if it's back here it's still gonna get in a circle but to get there's got to go out and if you're super vertical it's still gonna get in the circle but it's gotta", "start": 718.679, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "go back a little to get to that yeah it's still kind of the same checkpoint where it should be yeah but they get there in different fashions and then obviously we talk about the risk", "start": 726.839, "duration": 16.652}
{"chunk": "conditions that go along with that so I don't think a bunch of drills here for this I think a general understanding of wherever you are coming from you got to kind of match up the down swing pieces", "start": 735.18, "duration": 17.21}
{"chunk": "to that exactly you", "start": 743.16, "duration": 4.809}
