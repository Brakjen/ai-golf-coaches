{"chunk": "perfect, but at least gives you an idea that he is creating that space. He does some interesting stuff with his head and neck tilts there in transition, probably", "start": 219.4, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "to allow him to come from the inside of the ball. Um, but you see his head backing away. You see his lead side", "start": 229.12, "duration": 18.08}

{"chunk": "of crossing back behind him. Kind of a bowler look. Some baseball players actually work on this move as well. So,", "start": 246.08, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "it's uh an interesting pattern. Um but at the root of this golf swing, it's all about creating that space. Something he's talked about before. Point being,", "start": 253.28, "duration": 20.56}

{"chunk": "wind fire. Right. Well, and you see it with a trail leg, too. It's like everything's pushing in. Yeah. Right. The the thought there for us anyways is", "start": 427.319, "duration": 19.88}
