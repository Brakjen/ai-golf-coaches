{"chunk": "know you know as your if I just stay in left in in front Bend I wind up over here somewhere yeah so I've got a convert the left Bend", "start": 9.9, "duration": 16.019000000000002}
{"chunk": "has to be converted into right baby let's let's let's do that perfect I'm not going to talk anymore off camera we're going straight in one take one", "start": 18.029, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "okay [Music] [Music]", "start": 26.67, "duration": 15.418}
{"chunk": "I'm IO so let's talk about how to start the downswing and what the upper body does knows a couple pieces that we want to talk about kind of macro motions", "start": 50.399, "duration": 16.770999999999997}
{"chunk": "perfect well earlier we talked about how the lower body reflexes yep the upper body does the same thing you're gaining a little bit of bend this", "start": 59.34, "duration": 19.829}
{"chunk": "way yeah in transition yeah your pelvis is reflex thing everything's reflexing yeah and then it quickly bounces from", "start": 68.399, "duration": 15.419999999999998}
{"chunk": "reflexing into right side bending love it okay and so and for those who don't know right here okay if you're standing straight up and down right mm-hmm a", "start": 76.259, "duration": 19.851}
{"chunk": "reflexing would be your upper body bend down towards a guy right bending over more it's a simple term yeah yeah okay the second part of that is obviously there's a tilt here right", "start": 86.3, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "or there's a side Bend and so as you start your downswing yeah exactly so there's a there's a what can we say maintenance at left side men", "start": 95.19, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "yeah it's probably maintained just to start and I'm gaining a little bit of flexion in my pelvis yeah I'm bending from here a little bit just to start and", "start": 103.11, "duration": 17.07}
{"chunk": "so this left side and left shoulder is staying lower in early transition and then as we go there's gonna be this right side Bend it's gonna be introduced yeah that would be kind of the second", "start": 111.6, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "phase of it right if exactly the flexing part is part one this happening at the same time yeah it's all happening simultaneous and it's pretty quick but yeah I like to break it up it's what's", "start": 121.08, "duration": 18.781}
{"chunk": "happening it's reflex its left side Bend left shoulder stays lower and then right side Bend will be kind of part two and then there's gonna be a turn yes but the turn part isn't really", "start": 130.5, "duration": 19.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "independent is it no the turn does not coming from the upper body the turn is coming from down below Yeah right so the the the the downswing starting from the", "start": 140.459, "duration": 17.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "lower body pieces we talked about that's really what's causing the torso to do the turning yeah so there's three things going on there's the flexing there's the side", "start": 149.31, "duration": 15.719}
{"chunk": "Bend there's the turning component now before we dive into feels and drills and how to go through these guys let's take a look at a couple good players and show", "start": 156.81, "duration": 15.41}
{"chunk": "you how they do these three motions you okay my Oh so part number one as I start down my upper body reflexes let's talk", "start": 164.099, "duration": 16.991}
{"chunk": "about some feels right from the top I'm feeling my my belt buckle lowering reflexing I'm putting my upper body reflexes as I start down in terms of", "start": 203.48, "duration": 15.209999999999999}
{"chunk": "that part yeah that's not about right sounds about exactly mark and so as I'm doing this right as I'm hitting balls again if I already do this no big deal", "start": 211.25, "duration": 15.510000000000002}
{"chunk": "but if I don't and I want to start to feel I can start with something as simple as that yeah totally yeah you'll probably hit the first couple shots fat", "start": 218.959, "duration": 17.55}
{"chunk": "yeah and then learn how to match the mother and then learn how to match the other pieces with what your hands do so let's do one here with those two feels", "start": 227.42, "duration": 15.77}
{"chunk": "belt buckle and chest down I know you like a little shorter and slower to start with uh see what I can do belt buckle chest down okay there was a", "start": 235.18, "duration": 18.101}
{"chunk": "little heavy right yep and so and that's to be expected for me in the beginning if I'm gonna actually get lower I gotta make some adjustments yeah you're gonna have more extension in your right wrist", "start": 244.25, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "and a little more bend in your arm so yeah jump that up like this let's do one more so belt buckle how do I start my downswing belt buckle points down", "start": 253.7, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "towards the ground notice my lead leg going external by itself as I do that that's another conversation chest is working closer to", "start": 262.01, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "the ground as I go down let's go ahead and do one like that belt buckle and chest reflex ain't good that was good so", "start": 269.15, "duration": 19.019}
{"chunk": "that would be part number one now let's pause for a second let's talk about the second part we talked about about the the side down okay Milo so part number", "start": 278.51, "duration": 17.369999999999997}
{"chunk": "two beyond the flexion part would be the side bends so let's kind of talk through that from the top of the backswing how do I start my down so I can only have", "start": 287.03, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "got a left side band and oh right so as we start our downswing there's a lot of stuff happening down below and I need to", "start": 296.18, "duration": 15.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "add in some right side Bend fairly quickly so that I don't wander my body way over here because if I just", "start": 304.61, "duration": 15.059000000000001}
{"chunk": "stayed in front Bend and left Bend I wind up too far out in front so as we change directions now I'm you can start", "start": 312.229, "duration": 15.03}
{"chunk": "to see I'm getting some crunch up here in my right side which is keeping me centered up the top of the ball so when you so I think two things for someone who doesn't know side band in a simple", "start": 319.88, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "term being shoulder Hiep closer together yep is that fair and so that action that's happened if you go to the top of the swing again I love those visuals now already your lead", "start": 329.21, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "shoulders lower than your trail shoulder Yeah right and already your lead side of your pelvis is lower when you well we're saying here is when you do the transition pieces with your lead sigh", "start": 338.78, "duration": 16.290000000000003}
{"chunk": "the pelvis that lead shoulders gonna stay lower in early transition as a reaction to that and to not have your upper body goes so far forward towards", "start": 346.91, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "the top I've stayed in left tilt you'd see I'd be way over here so immediately I bounced into more of a right side Bend to keep me centered up so from it love", "start": 354.74, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "that so in terms of the feels from the upper body that lead side that lead let's flip flop spots that lead started please that lead side of the shoulder", "start": 363.77, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "being lower than the right is going to maintain that a little bit from my lower body action the sensations or the feels right of what we're doing is gonna be", "start": 372.47, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "adding in the right side Bend component yes and there'd be various fields for that but the trail shoulder and trail hip getting closer together right and so", "start": 380.45, "duration": 17.37}
{"chunk": "let's say I'm the player who over does the left side Bend has the no trail side note no side Bend so they're here and", "start": 389.0, "duration": 15.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "they do get this part okay I'm that player and I want to try and fix that am i starting off from the top here like this just kind of getting a fee I'm", "start": 396.62, "duration": 17.67}
{"chunk": "almost gonna feel this yeah as an exaggeration matched with what the lower body there you go yeah yeah so if we if", "start": 405.56, "duration": 15.03}
{"chunk": "we just looked at that and I have too much of here I would feel my right shoulder in close my right hip now in reality mixed with what I currently do", "start": 413.06, "duration": 17.19}
{"chunk": "and my other pieces that's going to keep me that keeps you centered pretty centered so right shoulder right up getting closer together as I'm doing my flexing and turning park so my belt", "start": 422.21, "duration": 18.45}
{"chunk": "buckle and chest go down towards the ground my right shoulder and my right hip get closer together yep we kind of put those as part one in Part C that's perfect so let's go ahead and do one", "start": 431.39, "duration": 17.91}
{"chunk": "here with that and again I'm not you know depending upon what I'm currently doing I'm not maybe thinking about all this at one time but just for the sake of examples that feels really good in", "start": 440.15, "duration": 18.330000000000002}
{"chunk": "athletic belt buckle and chest down right hip getting closer to my right shoulder in early transition let's go ahead and do on right hip and right", "start": 449.51, "duration": 17.93}
{"chunk": "shoulder closer chest down yeah and that feels really good and really athletic and even though I'm putting effort into", "start": 457.49, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "thinking about doing it it feels effortless if you will - and kind of natural and athletic which is right up your alley that's what I do and so that is the", "start": 469.209, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "second part the side man let's break here for a second again and then we'll talk a little bit about the rotation piece okay Milo so part number three", "start": 477.789, "duration": 17.94}
{"chunk": "here we said the flexing the side bend and the rotation yes I think we can kind of put a bow on this one and keep it pretty simple in that the upper body", "start": 486.009, "duration": 19.020000000000003}
{"chunk": "rotation piece is assuming nothing else are pretty much primarily happening because of the lower body pieces for sure in transition the the upper body is", "start": 496.149, "duration": 20.779999999999998}
{"chunk": "not rotating on its own yet so it's rotating because of what the lower body's done yeah yeah so it's not as though like if you were to go up to the", "start": 505.749, "duration": 17.62}
{"chunk": "top again I'm holding your pelvis and you're like opening your right so no so any upper body rotation that's going on that ribcage rotation torso rotation is", "start": 515.169, "duration": 17.522}
{"chunk": "a byproduct of what the lower body is yes is doing and so you know I think with these things I don't we got to do much more on that I think with these", "start": 524.05, "duration": 16.409}
{"chunk": "things the idea is hey here's what's going on it's these three pieces work with a coach to find out which one or all three of those someone would need", "start": 532.48, "duration": 15.689}
{"chunk": "more of and kind of why and learn how to put the pieces together while having some feels you know right the feeling of the flexing and the the chest getting", "start": 540.129, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "more down the belt buckle down the feeling of the right shoulder and the right hip kind of getting closer together and turning and now they really all go together right yeah that's what's", "start": 548.319, "duration": 18.331}
{"chunk": "happening in order for me to be able to turn and stay more or less centered yeah and stay in my inclinations those are", "start": 557.439, "duration": 17.689999999999998}
