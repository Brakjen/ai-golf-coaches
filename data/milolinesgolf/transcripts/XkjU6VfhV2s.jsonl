{"chunk": "hey everybody today we're going to talk about the reverse slot swing pretty common swing amongst the legends", "start": 0.08, "duration": 17.06}
{"chunk": "of old and today for sure [Music] okay henry so oftentimes when we hear", "start": 14.24, "duration": 17.998}
{"chunk": "coaches and players in general talk about the golf swing they talk about how they they want to make a loop", "start": 25.359, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "with their hands in the club but is that often what we see from the best players it's a little different than what they might think it is but they talk also about", "start": 33.84, "duration": 17.438000000000002}
{"chunk": "keeping the club in front of them especially in the takeaway which is something a lot of you guys at home probably are working on but if you watch", "start": 42.879, "duration": 19.842000000000002}
{"chunk": "a lot of the swings of old and today in fact does the club really stay in front quite like they say that is", "start": 52.16, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "maybe not it's it's it's hard to determine without 3d you know most people actually keep it more in front than you think at least", "start": 61.76, "duration": 15.359000000000002}
{"chunk": "their hands stay more in front hands are not getting really in and some players did go in but then they got they went more up so we should throw in some", "start": 68.96, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "swings of some of the legends like ben hogan for example sam sneed i like i like to consider bruce litzkie a legend", "start": 76.72, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "he never practiced in one like 20 times that's pretty pretty good pretty legendary slot swing he reverse slotted it like with the best of them some would say he was over the top but", "start": 87.36, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "no you don't hit it that good and be over the top well that's why i hear a lies okay well they they look at these legends of old and they say okay well he", "start": 96.24, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "took it inside and then he swung from over the top and he hit a little fade or but either way they say it was on top", "start": 104.88, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "over the top yeah let's let's go through this let's define this so they're clear on what this move actually is what's really going on okay so", "start": 113.6, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "what we see happening if we we're to draw in a plane here so you you got a stick there i'm gonna do you want it on the shaft plane", "start": 122.56, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "that's set up is that where you'd like it more or less on the shaft plane okay so right in here maybe put it far enough back so i can move without hitting yeah there you go so that's pretty close to", "start": 131.92, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "on the shaft plane now what the players in the past and even a lot of them today you'll see as they start this club away", "start": 140.8, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "it's moving inside of that original shaft plane like a hogan it's in", "start": 149.68, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "and then it's coming down on top of that but it's not over the top like what we see from amateurs", "start": 158.48, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "we just see the hand plane working more back out at the ball and the shaft shallowing out onto the plane that they're wanting to swing on so that their path into the ball is still pretty", "start": 168.0, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "zeroed out those guys yeah those were spinning golf balls they were hitting so they curve a lot and those guys hit it pretty straight yeah i doubt their path", "start": 177.04, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "was like five from out to enter it was pretty close it was pretty pretty reasonable so there's a few parts of this let's start with the takeaway so", "start": 184.64, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "make that move uh again for us so what you guys are seeing at home is wow that club's going inside it's going inside this inside our", "start": 192.879, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "shaft plane line here yeah this golf swing is on an arc right this club is moving on an arc so it's not a straight line", "start": 202.64, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "if we were moving it back in a straight line you would probably hit that shaft but because it's on a bit of an arc when you turn", "start": 211.04, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "when you turn that club's going to go to the inside yeah and so that's basically what those old timers were doing they were", "start": 219.44, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "moving that golf club with their turn and their arms were basically staying fairly connected to their rib cage in the early part of the backswing and then", "start": 228.159, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "their arms went up so i call it in up and up and then they went out a little bit a lot of them there their path went out at the ball or even sometimes", "start": 235.68, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "slightly outside the ball okay so let's let's go into transition now so the out part are we talking about the whole system or", "start": 244.319, "duration": 17.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "are we talking more about our hands and it's the direction the hands are directed again by the pivoting action of the body", "start": 252.56, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "so the end was created by this because i haven't really changed the relationship here i've just turned yeah on a fairly steep plane so it went in now up now if", "start": 261.04, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "i just let my arms stay kind of like they are and i start to unwind the hands appear to be traveling out some amount yeah it was all controlled by pivot so those", "start": 270.4, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "guys weren't actually throwing hands out and club out they were starting to pivot dynamically and then", "start": 279.68, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "what happened is because their hands went out so they were in up and the hands went out the club head", "start": 287.28, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "stayed back and and still came down on plane it didn't get it's not over the top because the club didn't get over the top yeah over the", "start": 296.479, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "top really what it means is the club is getting yeah out those guys the center of mass still stayed yeah", "start": 305.68, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "math went back so they this has been coined by a really famous coach named jim mclean he calls it the reverse slot", "start": 314.479, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "because instead of going and slotting it up to under they're slotting it in to over but they're still coming down that channel that you want to see the", "start": 323.52, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "club coming down so it's a good word channel well for me there's no optimal plane there's kind of a a window we want to kind of go", "start": 331.6, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "through this this nice window it's a channel if we get too far out or too far under yeah we're outside of the optimal channel and we're", "start": 340.8, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "going to struggle but if we can get it kind of within the window of where we want to be a nice little channel guys who are more toward the top side of", "start": 350.24, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "the channel are going to be more fade by us and guys who are more toward the bottom side generally more draw biased yeah unless they do some interesting", "start": 358.4, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "things now we've released a video uh recently on hand path and actually i wanted to do a little demonstration on", "start": 365.919, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "that so in this video we talked about our hand path and we actually showed both of ours in slow motion and we both are a little bit", "start": 373.68, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "of this reverse slot swing believe it or not because the hand path the hands are really traveling different from the club yes if you look", "start": 382.24, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "at it but if i were to just have sort of those noodles limp arms like sometimes will do and exercises and i", "start": 389.6, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "turn you see those hands go inside and i turn back they actually get slung just slightly more on top of the planet", "start": 397.68, "duration": 20.399}
{"chunk": "me because it's like having a rope right so if you kind of get this rope going going going and then eventually everything gets", "start": 408.16, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "kicked out yeah right so there's a little bit of that in transition with our hands and arms for sure and amongst a lot of modern players that exists", "start": 418.72, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "there's a lot of players who have some of this now is it the only way to do it i always like to throw that out there heck no sergio does not do this", "start": 426.72, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "sergio's more the other way he's more out and then his hands fall down so there's matchups for every pattern i just wanted to make sure everybody", "start": 434.88, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "understands that i don't necessarily subscribe to there's one way to do this because then i'll get called out and someone will say well so and so does it", "start": 443.199, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "there's a lot of ways to swing a golf club i actually prefer this pattern it's more like a baseball swing because in a baseball swing there are", "start": 451.52, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "you don't your arms are not falling down as you're swinging your arms are being slung out and around you and they're going along for the ride", "start": 458.8, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "with your pivot so once we we don't want them to get way behind us we also don't want to drive them right but if if we get them in a good", "start": 467.36, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "structure at the top then they can just go along for the ride with us yeah so our pivot sends them into the arc we want them on we're not actually like", "start": 476.639, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "trying to make them go somewhere else we're turning back turning through and allowing the pivot to dictate where they go yeah okay we've", "start": 485.12, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "talked enough we have to demonstrate some reverse slaughters yeah i need this going on we're gonna exaggerate it i'm gonna show some like", "start": 494.4, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "exaggerations so it's gonna be now some would say oh that's really over the top it's gonna hit a draw like that's a pretty darn perfect little", "start": 501.52, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "shot it had a little draw too that was perfect so you'll see on video that was definitely in and over and i started it", "start": 514.56, "duration": 16.122}
{"chunk": "slightly right and hit a tight draw yeah maybe i should swing like that that was pretty good that was pretty good your turn let's see what happens i'm not even going to see a shape i'm just going to", "start": 531.36, "duration": 16.558}
{"chunk": "go up and hit it see what happens see if it draws your face so you want it like that yeah and up", "start": 539.519, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "a little over but really feel like the club gets yeah back in that transition i can feel that at risk we talk about that's kind", "start": 548.959, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "of the key to get keeping that club the center mess back versus kicking it out now we got problems yeah i hit a little draw too you hit a tight", "start": 556.72, "duration": 18.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "little draw as well so hmm we'll have to go back and look at those on video and see what they look like see if we actually", "start": 570.08, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "succeed i know we both actually have this pattern slightly built into our swings by nature but it's probably not so extreme for sure and i like it i mean", "start": 584.16, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "you know i like seeing a little bit of a fade for the most part so to me when i'm turning again the system moves", "start": 592.16, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "slightly to the inside because it's on the arc so if i just it's it's the same idea as if i attach this club to my sternum", "start": 600.399, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "and i turn that club does not go out on a straight line or else i'd be doing something to manipulate that it goes in", "start": 608.399, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "now there are guys like matt wolf for example where his handle gets pushed down more and then he stands it up with a little wrist hinge and no forearm", "start": 616.56, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "rotation in his backswing so because his forearms don't rotate the club up on plane the club just you keep hinging your wrists keep hinging your wrist", "start": 626.16, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "keep turning keep turning the club stays over here all the time so it appears like it's a straight line but you better believe he's still turning to make that happen his hands", "start": 634.48, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "actually follow an in he actually has an in and out motion yeah with his hands he does so yeah he does so maybe he's a", "start": 643.12, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "reverse slaughter too the reverse slot with the hands but again i you know i turn in here and the hands travel up the plane but it's", "start": 651.44, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "more because of my turn i don't you know some people might have a little more arm raise mine's a little bit more just with my turn", "start": 659.76, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "and then when i get in transition again those hands kick out a little bit because of that sort of sit and turn move and then the club shallows", "start": 667.6, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "yep the wrist angle so but typically i like to see a little bit of a fade and you know it's probably a move", "start": 676.56, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "that tends to produce a little bit more of that i would say i just wanted to make sure i demonstrated that i'm coming you", "start": 686.079, "duration": 17.762}
{"chunk": "but i'm hitting a push draw out of it yeah so so if you guys like this video subscribe to the channel and we'd love to have you come over and", "start": 702.88, "duration": 16.078000000000003}
