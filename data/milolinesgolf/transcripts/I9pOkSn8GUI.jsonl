{"chunk": "out what what works best for you you are a we're both right-handed but I'm just saying as far as the stretch where I'm feeling it the stretch is there helps me", "start": 427.8, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "get the stretch and it turns my right arm off cuz I want my right arm to do none of this crap yeah you don't want it going extending out and you don't want", "start": 436.52, "duration": 17.919}
