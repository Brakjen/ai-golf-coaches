{"chunk": "can't rotate and when you do why the ball tends to go way to the left so over the last couple of weeks I have been", "start": 12.66, "duration": 20.128999999999998}
{"chunk": "getting quite a few video lessons as well as live lessons where I see some similarities in my students so I'm", "start": 24.029, "duration": 18.211}
{"chunk": "guessing these are pretty common things for for most of you out there so let's talk about the main reasons that cause", "start": 34.11, "duration": 18.449}
{"chunk": "you not to be able to rotate so number one I want to talk about your posture at address so I've done a video on this and I still see people showing up with their", "start": 42.87, "duration": 21.541}
{"chunk": "posture looking something like this where they're their rear end is way behind their heels and then as they", "start": 53.76, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "start their backswing you start to see the left hip moving forward and the right hip staying more or less where it is so they think that they've maintained", "start": 61.53, "duration": 15.931000000000001}
{"chunk": "their posture but in reality because your left hip has come forward the center of your pelvis has moved into the ball okay now as you go in to start into", "start": 70.59, "duration": 18.09}
{"chunk": "the downswing the right side starts to move in closer and now you're in your own way so this causes a couple of", "start": 79.32, "duration": 15.5}
{"chunk": "difficulties first thing is it causes because you're in the way you have to figure out how to get the club on the ball so either the club is going to come", "start": 86.58, "duration": 16.09}
{"chunk": "in from the outside or the club's gonna fall kind of back behind you and you're gonna flip the club over so you either you're either gonna hit big poles or", "start": 95.13, "duration": 19.548000000000002}
{"chunk": "you're gonna hit pushes and hooks so first thing we've got to do is we've got a remedy the posture that's too much", "start": 104.909, "duration": 15.822}
{"chunk": "bent over with your your rear end too far behind you so we got to get your posture a little bit more relaxed so we can start to move our pelvis out of the", "start": 113.22, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "way that's number one here we have that same student one swing later and just by fixing his posture check out the", "start": 120.96, "duration": 20.49}
{"chunk": "difference and how his lower body works and how much more he rotates and how much closer he stays down the wall okay", "start": 130.77, "duration": 18.630000000000003}
{"chunk": "the second thing I see that causes people difficulty being able to rotate is the clubface is to open so as they", "start": 140.43, "duration": 20.64}
{"chunk": "reach the top of their swing and they start down they've got the clubface looking something like this so that clubface is pretty open so from", "start": 151.29, "duration": 16.47}
{"chunk": "here if I turn into the ball the ball is going to go away to the right so what am I going to have to do I'm going to get to here and I'm going to put on the", "start": 158.55, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "brakes and throw the club head because it's coming in a little open okay the third thing I see is the club head or", "start": 168.09, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "the club is coming in too steep so let's say we we make a good backswing we've got our depth in our hips and we start down we get the club coming in steep am", "start": 177.03, "duration": 18.69}
{"chunk": "I going to be able to continue rotating well if I do the ball is going well left so what my brain is going to do is it's", "start": 186.69, "duration": 19.409999999999997}
{"chunk": "gonna sense oh this is coming in from the outside if I keep turning I'm in trouble so it's gonna put on the brakes kind of stand up and shallow things out", "start": 196.5, "duration": 15.617999999999999}
{"chunk": "to try to get things going the right direction those are the main three I see now how do we fix them so as I mentioned", "start": 203.959, "duration": 21.282}
{"chunk": "earlier number one is get the posture where your your pelvis is more under you so that we have room to move away", "start": 214.95, "duration": 16.82}
{"chunk": "number two we either have to work on our grip or our wrist conditions so one of two things is happening you might have a", "start": 222.5, "duration": 15.489999999999998}
{"chunk": "good grip but as you swing it back you get some funny risk conditions maybe too much Cup in your left wrist and then when you start down that face is coming in open because of it so we've got to", "start": 231.03, "duration": 19.229999999999997}
{"chunk": "figure out how to get your wrist to flatten so that that face can be square so you can turn into the ball and the", "start": 240.51, "duration": 18.630000000000003}
{"chunk": "third one we've got to figure out how to get the club to stop tipping out this way and getting steep so I want you to", "start": 248.79, "duration": 17.249}
{"chunk": "you've got to feel like the club is following you down into the ball that club can't be tipping out this way if you want to be able to turn", "start": 258.479, "duration": 17.13}
{"chunk": "now if your goal is to hit it with your chest facing the ball then you're going to need to tip it out but if your goal is to be able to turn into the shot and", "start": 267.33, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "not hit it left then the club has got to follow you okay I've got a couple drills for how to feel how to rotate correctly", "start": 275.069, "duration": 20.459}
{"chunk": "number one is just a drill that I like to use where I take your arms away so all you're gonna do is you're going to keep both arms straight and you're gonna practice just turning back and through", "start": 284.639, "duration": 18.862000000000002}
{"chunk": "and you're going to hit the shot you know out there 40 or 50 yards just a little chip shot like that where there's no use of the arm so it's just pure", "start": 294.65, "duration": 19.688}
{"chunk": "rotation so how can you not rotate while doing that swing okay then the second drill which I really like for teaching", "start": 304.229, "duration": 17.581}
{"chunk": "you how to how to move correctly is you take your normal set up okay then I want you to take the club face and turn it", "start": 313.53, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "closed and take your normal grip so now you can see if I made a normal swing that clubface is really close I'm gonna hit a big hook so now what do I have to", "start": 320.669, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "do I have to feel like the club follows me more so the club stays behind me and I turn into the ball and I don't let the faith flip over so from there it'll look", "start": 330.87, "duration": 22.799}
{"chunk": "something like this and you can see I was able to hit that shot fairly straight and I hit a little draw", "start": 340.199, "duration": 17.671}
{"chunk": "I missed the green just left but it didn't go away left because I let that club follow me into the ball so then once you have that then you can start", "start": 350.46, "duration": 20.82}
{"chunk": "getting your setup correct relaxing and letting that club follow you into the ball and you won't pull it when you", "start": 360.69, "duration": 20.311}
{"chunk": "rotate out of the way I was pretty good you", "start": 371.31, "duration": 12.9}
