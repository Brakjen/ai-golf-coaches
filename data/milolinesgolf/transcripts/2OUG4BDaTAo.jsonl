{"chunk": "know about getting Fairway Woods off of the ground so Jack this is something I've seen a lot on the lpj T caddy out", "start": 7.68, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "there and actually my wife Dana we went through kind of a long process of changing over her bag changing over some of the clubs she had getting more Loft", "start": 15.759, "duration": 19.959}
{"chunk": "in the bag this go some kind of very lofted hybrid must have a lot of Loft on it h nicely so many of our students at", "start": 25.279, "duration": 19.72}
{"chunk": "home hitting Fairway Woods off the ground especially three-wood they're having trouble getting it up in the air and they're you know constantly searching for how to hit three-wood off", "start": 38.28, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "the Fairway well should they be hitting three-wood off the Fairway that's the question one of the big things we see is three woods and it's just terminology", "start": 46.239, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "right cuz what is a three-wood really it's in traditional 15 Dees of Loft in something about 43 in long that terminology has changed over the time", "start": 54.96, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "we're seeing lots of for Woods or three hls all that means is there's more Loft on that club as as simple as that we are seeing three Woods deteriorate in every", "start": 63.68, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "level of the game because highspeed guys they're hitting it as far as their driver it's useless low speed players can't get it off the ground it's useless", "start": 72.08, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "yeah so it's finding the right Loft for your specific needs as a player and there's a bunch of advantages to more Loft and a fairway wood over other clubs", "start": 79.72, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "you've got the center of gravity of the golf club much further back much lower with that wood shaped head compared to a slim iron for instance you've got a 335", "start": 89.36, "duration": 18.518}
{"chunk": "tips so a Slimmer tip section here kicks the ball higher than a wider tip section in an iron or hybrid shaft you've got a longer length shaft which gives you more", "start": 98.119, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "speed than an iron you've got a lighter shaft which gives you more speed and more flight than an iron yeah everything is in your favor to get the ball Airborne with a fairywood over a long", "start": 106.479, "duration": 19.162}
{"chunk": "iron and even a longer hybrid one of the biggest problems I see on the Range te I see Senior players showing up with three", "start": 115.88, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "and four irons and three woods and wondering why all their clubs go the same length yep it's one of the things I hit all my clubs the same length and I'm", "start": 124.28, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "just like well there's a speed Factor here plus the the modern golf balls they don't spin that much so they're a little more difficult to elevate yep that's why", "start": 133.52, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "we see more lofted Fairway medals hybrids they go all the way down I mean we we see 11 Woods out there on the on the Range now yes we've got nine wood", "start": 141.04, "duration": 18.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "for here to test for you today we've got lots of others as well but and we picked a ping because they're specifically very good for a couple of other reasons", "start": 150.68, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "shallow play ping you play ping anyway I play ping perfect shallow from Crown to Soul which means if your golf Ball's here very easy to get under the center of gravity the golf will launch it and", "start": 158.8, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "spin it lots of Loft and an adjustable sleeve so if you need more Loft we can get it through the through the sleeve and if you want a flatter L angle watch", "start": 167.879, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "Miles video on the on the FL FL the flatter L angle is nice that's a nice thing to have with these clubs you know especially for players that might be a little bit shorter when you have that", "start": 176.2, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "trouble with the ground contact with this long bulky Club it's almost like you're hitting driver off the deck if you can't hit driver off the deck you probably shouldn't be hitting three-wood", "start": 185.319, "duration": 17.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "off the deck honestly y because it's just it's you're making it difficult on yourself to get that thing Airborne so let's get some Loft let's get some spin", "start": 193.519, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "let's get that land angle coming down those are things we're going to be touching on this video and doing kind of an experiment with true I think Los the e as well there's plenty of tool players", "start": 202.64, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "out there now with seven woods and if they can do it and they don't care and then you shouldn't you and I when we go out and play if we get a downhill lie or a tight lie I'm not pulling out", "start": 211.76, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "three-wood I'm going to go down to my hybrid or you might hit your fivewood something that's going to get up in the air and you can carry it pretty close to", "start": 220.84, "duration": 15.318999999999999}
{"chunk": "as far off that lie it's just you're you're getting it Airborne you know that's the difference I see lots of high-s speeded players playing lofted woods now I think Dustin Johnson has", "start": 228.0, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "like a nine wood D play a n for he might still have it so when you're swinging it that fast and you've got low Loft let's say you've got 14 and a half 15\u00b0 3w it", "start": 237.439, "duration": 16.562}
{"chunk": "catches up with the driver over 300 yards like what are you using that for give yourself some Loft and make it a useful Club be able to land it on a Green from a long way out that's", "start": 246.4, "duration": 16.998}
{"chunk": "important and and on that point this is why we see a lot of Tor Pros actually top their 3-woods believe it or not you guys aren't alone at home there's Tor", "start": 254.959, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "Pros that get on these tighter lives and they try to hit three-wood they top it yeah and if they had that fivewood or a hybrid in that situation they probably", "start": 263.44, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "in retrospect would go back and do that if they could absolutely get their chest on the ball a little more length golf Shar more Loft way easier exactly so", "start": 271.6, "duration": 15.480000000000002}
{"chunk": "it's just going to be easier on you if you're hitting 3w off a te sure we know you can probably make good solid contact get airborne no problem there but off the ground this is where you want to", "start": 279.36, "duration": 18.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "really start to think okay do I really want that hot three-wood in the bag and often the three-wood doesn't even go as far as the fivewood I find if you're not", "start": 288.52, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "a high-speed player you might actually find the fivewood G farther than the three wood when you do a a gapping session with our Woods which is kind of something we do in a long game fitting", "start": 296.52, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "you'll see them all maybe land a similar distance all the way through down to seven wood in some cases and the three-wood May bundle out a bit further", "start": 304.68, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "but because it didn't get airborne it may even land shorter the fivewood carries the furthest maybe goes the longest seven wood maybe carries the furthest again but stops up quicker so", "start": 313.8, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "it's like what's applicable for your game and where you play your golf okay so let's do a little experiment 9wood is the equivalent of what five iron five", "start": 322.08, "duration": 16.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "iron roughly depends on you know it's two factors at the moment we got iron lofts being Del lofted over the years yeah and and wood Lofts kind of we haven't got this far down yet so", "start": 330.6, "duration": 16.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "realistically a five on is the right space right and obviously you got potentially different lengths and some other things going on so but let's do this experiment I'm going to try to slow", "start": 339.16, "duration": 20.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "my club head speed down and hit this club let's say 9wood 170 180 in the air which is probably about average for most", "start": 348.319, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "people would liked that yeah yeah for a 9 same with five iron I'm going to try to get in that same ballpark and see where we line up with that those launch conditions and the landing conditions", "start": 357.56, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "absolutely most important thing with with an iron or anything at this distance you're trying to hit the Grain and give yourself an advantage to not be chipping you want to pop okay so guys", "start": 366.599, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "I'm going to try to get a Target carry of about 170 to 180 so I'm going to grip down a little bit I got to slow down quite a bit see what we get for some", "start": 375.08, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "launch conditions that'll be a little little short okay so we can start to see some", "start": 384.56, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "numbers though right so spin 3600 normally I spin a five iron probably around a 5,000 spin I would think yep", "start": 394.479, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "launch 16 land 35 okay let's try another one I'll try to go a little farther going to be a little too far that one chunked a little bit but okay", "start": 402.36, "duration": 19.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "so that was a pretty good let's keep that one so spin rate right around four launch around 15 land angle 38 so that", "start": 415.639, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "thing is landing and it's rolling that's rolling like a driver almost the best thing I can explain about land angle is 45\u00b0 is the even point of the ball moving", "start": 423.599, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "forwards and down yeah so that's your first chance of being able to stop it anything over 45\u00b0 you got a much better chance anything under it's shooting yeah", "start": 432.28, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "so you're 7\u00b0 under 45 degre there okay so it's shoot it's running it's running so let's try 9wood and it's got in the flat setting so that should help us out", "start": 440.08, "duration": 17.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "I'm trying to get that 170 180 carry number it's going to be pretty hard but try to slow it down this wants to go a little left", "start": 448.919, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "slowed it down pretty good okay but that's all right I hit it left we know that it's it's a longer Club yep so a little more upright than that five iron", "start": 460.599, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "when I was gripping down right but here we go so spin rate 4500 and I just chipped that thing and you're at 3900 so", "start": 468.84, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "600 RPMs we got the launch up almost the full Dee Y and look at the land angle that's really important so we're at 42 whereas before we were 36 3 37 or 38", "start": 476.479, "duration": 20.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah it's at least 4 degre I can just flip back to that your average with a five iron there 37\u00b0 let's can you pull up the peak height yep so your Peak", "start": 486.879, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "height there is averaging at 65 ft on the five iron and 81 ft on the seven uh 9wood so obviously some big differences", "start": 495.08, "duration": 19.16}
{"chunk": "here and unless you're swinging like as fast as maybe me and Milo he just say it but you really don't need a four and five iron you can start putting in some", "start": 504.039, "duration": 19.680999999999997}

{"chunk": "your wife is an LPGA Tour player mhm who has about average male Club head speed so it kind of lines up so again put your", "start": 530.24, "duration": 18.679}
{"chunk": "egos aside I know it's hard I get it we all want to hit that Stinger for iron and all these fun shots but let's get that ball up in the air right yeah", "start": 540.079, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "stopping on the green like we saying 170 yards you're generally not laying up with 170 yard shot you're having to go out green yeah greens are harder to to", "start": 548.48, "duration": 15.518999999999998}

{"chunk": "high as you can hit it as high and as far as I can hit it let's see if I can do one I want to thank cool clubs in Scottdale Arizona for hosting us today", "start": 572.12, "duration": 16.12}
