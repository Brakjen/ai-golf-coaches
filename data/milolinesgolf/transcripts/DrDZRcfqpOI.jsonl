{"chunk": "and we're talking a little bit about a really important topic about our how our pivot works and that topic is how to keep the left", "start": 9.04, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "side of our body left shoulder especially low in the transition period [Music]", "start": 17.76, "duration": 17.05}
{"chunk": "a really common problem i see amongst players in general is in transition this front side of their body kind of", "start": 28.0, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "goes up this way right right and when that happens what happens to my golf club", "start": 36.88, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "it falls back behind me causing me to have to now use my hands to get that club out on the ball right yep so there's some compensations", "start": 44.32, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "being made so what i prefer to see is a pivot that's very symmetrical so as we change directions", "start": 54.239, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "the left side of my body is working down and around okay now there's some keys to this and we were have off camera we were just", "start": 61.84, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "talking about it yeah and i think it was kind of like a little aha it is a little uh-huh so", "start": 71.36, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "when we want to keep the left shoulder lower in transition or to start the downswing are we just keeping the left shoulder", "start": 80.159, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "lower should that be our focus maybe you've probably also heard have your left shoulder separate from your ear too", "start": 88.4, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "yeah i heard that as well yes have the left shoulder separating from your ear staying down", "start": 95.6, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "but those things are impossible right if one thing in our lower body starts to moves incorrectly well and this all goes back to a bunch", "start": 103.2, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "of your videos in the past about sequencing sort of starting that chain that goes up the rest of your body right", "start": 113.04, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "so sequencing wise this is more towards the end isn't it wouldn't be one of the first things well it's definitely not the first thing to", "start": 120.719, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "move the first thing we see move on most players is the pelvis left knee yeah so it kind of i'd say", "start": 129.36, "duration": 15.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "motion generally starts right in our middle right here yeah works down our legs our legs hit the ground put pressure into the ground and", "start": 137.2, "duration": 15.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "then our upper body starts to go now this is all happening in like a split second yeah you know the difference in the timing of when my", "start": 144.4, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "pelvis moves and when my shoulder starts to move is like hundreds of seconds it's like literally on the frame it might be one", "start": 152.64, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "frame yeah but it's important that one frame is kind of important right so sounds like what you're saying", "start": 161.36, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "is where this hip goes so does the shoulder kind of that's what we talked about off camera as i told you", "start": 169.44, "duration": 19.679}
{"chunk": "if your left hip starts to go up in transition this shoulder will not stay down it also will not get away from your chin", "start": 178.0, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "you know we you hear that get your shoulder away from your chin well if this goes up that's not going away from my chin", "start": 187.92, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "so the problem is not the left shoulder going up it's a symptom of something else happening yeah earlier on in the chain now what about the people that are home", "start": 196.239, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "watching this and they're saying but the left shoulder always rises in the golf swing well it does but when is it happening right", "start": 205.68, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "do we want it to be early in transition it does or is it later yeah it's it's it's the second one it's it's later", "start": 213.04, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "and it's really more where the camera is and the fact that it's circling back around on plane right it's a spiraling action and in the downswing", "start": 222.08, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "we want to have everything working down we don't want to have our body working up so as we're starting to transition down", "start": 230.56, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "until my my legs have re-squared everything is really going downhill okay once i've gotten back to where i'm square now my left", "start": 239.76, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "side is going to start to go post up and go around the corner right and you can see my shoulder is going to start to go up and around and how high up and around behind me my", "start": 249.04, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "shoulder gets some of that's determined by some other factors like for me my body is going to get really", "start": 258.16, "duration": 15.758999999999999}
{"chunk": "around by the time i hit it my body is facing you know very much back toward the camera so how high up is the shoulder well pretty high pretty far down behind", "start": 266.16, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "me and now if i was a player who has less of that kind of an action and i arrive more at impact like this", "start": 275.28, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "right with less opening the shoulder is going to be lower just kind of the way it works and a little bit more of like a", "start": 283.04, "duration": 15.999999999999998}
{"chunk": "shrug i guess it would probably be a little more shrugged up you'd be looking a little bit more like this now that wouldn't be my preference my preference would be to have", "start": 292.32, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "the body getting around the corner a little bit more yeah but all right so this has been one of my issues for years sort of this lateral motion and then my hip", "start": 299.84, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "going up right so now i get this shoulder that's high and you're saying okay it's just a byproduct really of what's going on down here", "start": 308.96, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "so what should be my focus if there's a drill or a practice i should or maybe it's just a thought i should be thinking", "start": 317.52, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "well number one is that hip socket can't get outside of that ankle okay so if your hip socket starts to go outside of your ankle", "start": 324.96, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "so swing it up get your hip socket outside your ankle now what's gonna happen from there on right shoulder that shoulder is gonna go up", "start": 332.88, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "and then i gotta throw this so whatever angle i've had is lost and it stalls rotation too exactly yep", "start": 341.6, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "so the the opposite would be the answer we want to feel like now as you change directions this is working down and around now see", "start": 350.08, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "how this shoulder's staying low yeah now you can just pour on the gas and keep coming out of the way okay okay that's a little different kind of motion right", "start": 358.08, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "and that hip never really gets outside of your feet right or ankles so it's kind of like this is right inside my ankle bone here", "start": 366.16, "duration": 19.678}
{"chunk": "it's kind of this hip moving back around instead of into that post exactly that would be my preference that's the", "start": 374.639, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "most dynamic way to pivot that's how we see baseball players tennis players pretty much everything that's how you", "start": 384.319, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "swing a stick if you want to do it with maximum force for some reason in golf where we ten most people tend to be a little more slighty a little more lateral", "start": 392.479, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "yeah a lot of it's because we're trying to swing inside out and hit draws but my preference would be that we stopped that", "start": 400.08, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "okay so my focus is keep to keep my shoulder lower in transition my real focus should be keeping my lead hip", "start": 407.44, "duration": 19.279}
{"chunk": "inside my ankle bone yep okay should i try one let's try one it's that simple see what you got i don't know if i can do it", "start": 417.199, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "just on the fly but we'll see cold turkey right here haven't hit any balls for a while", "start": 426.8, "duration": 19.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "now that was pretty pure my guess is that you were very successful right there well i tried to it really was feeling", "start": 438.88, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "like that hip it's going back around almost like it i'm trying to get this left cheek almost facing the camera sooner in a way", "start": 457.599, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "yeah because i definitely even playing golf today i think i was getting a little bit that way too so how'd that one feel it's good it was a nice little cut that's what i like to", "start": 466.08, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "see so so there you go there's a perfect feel for you all right so thanks guys for watching make sure you hit the uh", "start": 474.16, "duration": 15.76}
