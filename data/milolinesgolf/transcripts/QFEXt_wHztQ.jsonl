{"chunk": "what I see is that when most people start down swing they start pushing off a lot and as they do this belt stays straight up and then all of a sudden", "start": 27.56, "duration": 17.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "come to impact your zipper and your buttons are not in alignment and so they're not rotated and they have to throw and then quite often they get this", "start": 36.44, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "part way over here the hands way behind them so what I do is I ask them to put this in their belt loop most of it sticking out the lead side barely", "start": 45.84, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "anything on this side and then as they wind themselves up to make sure that their lead side doesn't collapse and this thing angled too far down they have", "start": 55.079, "duration": 18.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "to feel like it stays somewhat up yeah so we don't want to feel like it goes down down like this early so this side's going to feel like it's staying right", "start": 64.4, "duration": 18.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "somewhat up yes and now in transition I want them to visually see this thing work itself down and", "start": 73.159, "duration": 16.601999999999997}

{"chunk": "working too much down well there's two fold of that one is either my left my lead side is collapsing way too much or", "start": 112.439, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "two I'm staying in right Bend instead of left Bend yeah when we always talk about we want them to feel like their lead", "start": 121.479, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "their Trail side is expanding up and they're they're going to feel like their hips are level but they won't be then in transition as that lead side goes down", "start": 129.84, "duration": 19.6}

{"chunk": "rest of the chain so I see this left shoulder it's coming down as well it doesn't immediately start to go this direction either right because when this", "start": 156.04, "duration": 15.879000000000001}
{"chunk": "goes down it's pulling your lat your shoulder your chest and everything back on top yeah so everything's on top now this can't happen if they pull their", "start": 164.239, "duration": 18.721}

{"chunk": "camera so you can kind of see what this looks like from a a different angle and are we encouraging a player to spin the hips like this no no we're not and I'm", "start": 192.28, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "so glad you said that because I hear that quite often and the reality is if we're just spinning our hips this lead hip isn't going down no so what I want", "start": 202.0, "duration": 19.239}
{"chunk": "it to feel and look like I make this nice wind I actually feel like I'm keeping this left hip up but you can see that there's an angle down there has to", "start": 211.28, "duration": 16.679}

{"chunk": "creating a huge stretch across myself when I do that well and why do we do that because we know speed is created by the stretch and transition yeah right", "start": 237.2, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "and how much you can push away so yeah so Ed how would a player know if they're actually spinning out versus Landing left correctly well usually it's going", "start": 245.04, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "to be one of two things either one that left hip is going to come shooting straight up and they're probably going to spin their foot like this as opposed", "start": 253.319, "duration": 15.48}

{"chunk": "use see this thing hip or this hip shoot straight up that's when a guy can start spinning like really really hard the other one I see is I actually see", "start": 269.36, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "players spin this foot like this right that that's a Telltale sign that they didn't shift pressure nearly soon enough", "start": 278.36, "duration": 15.201}

{"chunk": "more right your general tendency is to slide and tilt and the left hip stay high and maybe some low Point issues", "start": 328.919, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "maybe some hyraw issues excessively right yeah and this is to try to eliminate some of that add a little more compression add a little more speed", "start": 337.199, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "right and kind of zero yourself out just a little bit better so we're going to use the downshift board and the stick at the same time so that it can show how", "start": 346.759, "duration": 19.04}

{"chunk": "things up yeah okay Dana so let's see a good example of kind of this exaggerated feel let's do it at a relatively slow", "start": 422.36, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "rate of speed but with more or less a full range of motion just so those at home can see what we're what we're getting at", "start": 432.44, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "here it's good yeah just a little skinny but that was that was the right pattern really EX exaggerate the down piece there you go a nice flushy", "start": 444.36, "duration": 17.96}

{"chunk": "exactly true and we use the alignment Rod to give us a visual reference so that we can actually see it moving out of the corner of our eye you know to get", "start": 492.56, "duration": 15.238999999999999}
