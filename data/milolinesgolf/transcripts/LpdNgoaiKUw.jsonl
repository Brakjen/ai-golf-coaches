{"chunk": "let's talk a little putting and how our setup can affect our ability to make some of these tough little left to right putts sneaky downhill left or righters", "start": 0.399, "duration": 20.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "[Music] okay milo so the inspiration for this video is actually from me watching a lesson that you had with a young junior", "start": 10.0, "duration": 16.18}
{"chunk": "out here in arizona rising junior great player and we talked about his struggles with putting the other junior term he had recently", "start": 20.08, "duration": 18.878}
{"chunk": "and he especially was struggling with pushing his putts okay something a lot of people at home struggle with pushing putts right for sure and what it came", "start": 29.599, "duration": 16.562}
{"chunk": "down to a little bit is some setup issues kind of where his eyes were relative to the ball how his putter was lying on the ground", "start": 37.92, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "and how his body was set up he was kind of setting up with almost an arched back like this and we got him to kind of round off his", "start": 46.879, "duration": 16.241000000000003}
{"chunk": "shoulders let his head round off a little bit and that allowed him to be able to really swing that putter on a better arc so believe it or not", "start": 55.28, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "we tell you can swing like an athlete we actually feel like you can putt like an athlete too so you know stuff we talked about with him was", "start": 63.359, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "number one he wasn't necessarily getting his eyes right over the ball for him it was almost just inside the ball getting the eyes in a position where you see the", "start": 71.6, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "line right correctly but for him it was getting what felt like his his head was laying on a table more so a little more roundedness because his eyes weren't up", "start": 80.0, "duration": 19.438}
{"chunk": "here yeah he was looking more this way than looking at the ball through the bottom of his eyes yeah peripheral instead of getting his face pointed at the ball so", "start": 90.159, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "his eyes are kind of going straight out and we do that just like in the golf swing we have some roundedness in our neck and our cervical spine here and we get down to the ball just like that yeah", "start": 99.439, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "and then you can see as you did that your shoulders kind of relaxed and came forward right now you've got some roundedness in the thoracic spine as well so it helps", "start": 108.079, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "you be able to face down to the ball right now here's the little extra nugget we gave him was on these left to righters keep in mind that the green is", "start": 117.04, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "sloped like this right yes so a lot of you are you guys at home are trying to lay the putter down flat on the ground flat on the ground but what does that do to lie angle this putter it shoots it", "start": 124.719, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "off to the to the right a little right and the putter has a little bit of loft too so now the face is pointed just a hair to the right right so one thing we", "start": 134.72, "duration": 15.680000000000001}
{"chunk": "gave him was to feel like the pressure in his feet was a little more in his heels yes just a little bit just fighting the slope of hair right", "start": 142.48, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "and then almost allowing the toe of the putter just to be up a little bit so the putter is really still level to the ground right or level to the horizon but", "start": 150.319, "duration": 20.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "the ground is sloped exactly yeah so now many of you probably aren't going to end up on a three percent or more slope on a left or right or but", "start": 159.76, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "it happens uh having the toe up just slightly in this in this instance because of our pressure and then having that rounded head we can", "start": 168.08, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "get these putts started a little bit more online it's not going to break right milo well you didn't play it you need to come over here", "start": 176.16, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "all right let's go over here there we go now we got a left to rider that was a good putt", "start": 185.36, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "there we go yeah i started out probably just outside left edge you're putting straight down the hill but you know many of you at home", "start": 192.8, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "are coming up to these putts pressure is just neutral even out on your toes you lay the putter down flat and your head's up here and you get this", "start": 201.12, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "wipey push out to the right you're like oh no and we see that all day you know that's a big miss for for people on these putts these downhill left derailers is", "start": 209.68, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "blocking it out to the right for sure it's hard to get the the left rider started high enough for most people right and a lot of it's because their setup doesn't match up right so pressure", "start": 218.0, "duration": 16.558}
{"chunk": "a little bit in your heels rounded neck and head down you could even also put just a hair pressure", "start": 226.319, "duration": 16.401999999999997}
{"chunk": "down the slope just a little bit to get it started you know like you're putting it down the slope right versus staying back and yeah it helps you swing", "start": 234.56, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "along the slope and if you're on a downhill like we are here yeah you want to be able to swing the putter basically as if you were on level ground right cool hopefully this tip helps you guys", "start": 243.519, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "with these nasty little leftovers downhill make that putt under pressure when you're nassau whatever it might be right for sure", "start": 252.72, "duration": 17.12}
