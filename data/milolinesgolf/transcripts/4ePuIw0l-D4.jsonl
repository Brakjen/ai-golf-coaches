{"chunk": "the seventh which is another pretty important piece of the puzzle and it's how we plane yes", "start": 23.519, "duration": 15.361999999999998}
{"chunk": "the tool we're using this is where we do the stretch get up out of your seat and go get a go get a drink some popcorn so yes we're", "start": 30.72, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "talking about swing plane this is probably one of the most noticeable differences that you'll see on on a video right is when you watch a", "start": 39.84, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "baseball player well the pitch is in this strike zone typically you might get some a little lower right so this ball you're either hitting where my shaft is or my hand is", "start": 47.76, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "your strike zone's way too high okay how about that from here i'm bringing high heat here okay", "start": 56.96, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "but in golf the ball's on the ground right except with driver so we're gonna talk a little bit about those differences so you got a couple different bats here so", "start": 65.519, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "i got a bat and a rope bat just to demonstrate how the the rope can get on plane because", "start": 75.119, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "as we mentioned earlier we like to see the barrel stand up in baseball and in golf we don't really want to see the the barrel go from here", "start": 83.36, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "to here we'd like to see it go from here to there so making that little loop or that that flow that we talk about so much yep just like in the golf swing and", "start": 92.799, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "so a tool i like to use to train my kids and myself i use it for golf and baseball is this rope bat if i put it on my shoulder", "start": 102.64, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "like this now when i go to swing i use my body to turn and that bat naturally this", "start": 111.04, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "rope naturally will line right up to my rotation and it stays on your back for just a little bit as you start right", "start": 118.56, "duration": 16.16}

{"chunk": "arms and this bat out yes we see that the same thing with you know you've probably seen one of these before people training their golf", "start": 134.72, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "swing with a rope right so they kind of take it up to the top leave it on their back for a second and then sling it off right yep", "start": 142.48, "duration": 15.919000000000002}
{"chunk": "so there's a good flow to it it's a good tool to train you to use your pivot to create the energy versus", "start": 150.72, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "your arms okay but as they could see that thing is swinging on a little different plane than this thing was okay that's swinging", "start": 160.319, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "well when i'm just doing it demonstrating i'm i'm swinging it about belt high yes i could imagine that the pitch is down there", "start": 169.04, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "and then it would look a little closer to the same ah so you're saying for baseball players at home maybe imagining that they're coming into", "start": 176.879, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "a pitch coming more at what would you say shin high knee high shin high because of the length this thing's so much shorter shin high would be", "start": 185.04, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "pretty comparable to swinging driver yeah so it's getting you closer to your plane so i think this brings up how do we get down to the golf ball", "start": 193.76, "duration": 18.158}
{"chunk": "that's on the ground well we got to talk a little bit about posture so why don't we talk a little bit about that and side bend as well okay so thing number one i'm just gonna get rid", "start": 202.959, "duration": 17.441999999999997}
{"chunk": "of the rope bat when i'm swinging this baseball bat you can see my my posture is fairly vertical", "start": 212.0, "duration": 19.36}

{"chunk": "going to bend more and bend over yes so that's what we need to incorporate into our golf swing so we need to create some inclination", "start": 228.959, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "with our chest so we're bending over and now as we're moving through the motion we're creating the same inclination so", "start": 237.68, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "i'm creating a side bend in my ribs and a little bit of bend in my waistline you can see it's actually angled down slightly as well", "start": 245.76, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "that way when you turn three you can see now your chest and shoulders are more on this plane whereas if the pitch was a little bit higher up you're more on this", "start": 254.959, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "point so to get this down all i'm doing is creating a little bit more bend to lower it so you have some bend in your ribs you also have a little more hip hinge like you talked", "start": 264.24, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "about got to have the hip hinge to keep your body out of the way if i don't have that hip hinge then i'm going to have to get down there a whole other way and it's a little more", "start": 273.52, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "complicated and you have some more roundedness up in your your upper spine as well for sure so so getting down to that golf ball how do we do it", "start": 282.0, "duration": 19.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "efficiently versus releasing levers well that's what most people do is they they take their baseball swing but then", "start": 290.639, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "they throw their arms down to get there versus just figuring out how to get their body into a plane that makes sense to put the club down there all right so", "start": 298.8, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "we're gonna give the baseball players a visual here so they can understand this low pitch theory right okay so i'm going to take this water bottle", "start": 306.8, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "and put a golf ball on top if i can get it balanced okay okay the wind doesn't blow up yeah so here's your low pitch right so you got to figure out how to get the bat down to that ball i don't", "start": 315.28, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "want to move i could foul ball right into my leg it's been a little while too high i got to feel like i'm even more down", "start": 323.28, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "than golf this is hard oh that was good ground ball we got the barrel down there that was hard though that's a good that's a good drill", "start": 332.32, "duration": 16.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "actually yeah use that one i'll get you you're gonna be mixing huh you're gonna get down there yeah uh so that gives you a little bit of a visual understanding of especially with", "start": 341.039, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "irons that's to be more the field a driver is going to actually feel more like a pitch maybe a knee-high right yeah because it's a longer club than a", "start": 350.24, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "baseball bat right so this thing is 34 inches actually this one's 33 inches my driver is 45 and a half inches", "start": 358.16, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "yeah significantly longer so i can reach to the ground like this like you always say i hear this in lessons all the time it's more like swinging a telephone pole so for the telephone pole if you were", "start": 367.84, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "swinging around the ground you'd be a little bit more upright and it's a little bit more of a round swing a little more level right so just like in baseball", "start": 376.88, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "kind of similar so it's a maybe a little more hip hinge a little more round in this but it's closer yep okay so hopefully that helps you guys with the", "start": 385.12, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "the swing plane understanding that we need to create a little bit more of that down that bend in the spine and some hip hinge to get down versus", "start": 393.28, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "rising up actually and throwing down that's not the way we really want to create speed it's not optimal just like in baseball we gotta use that rotation", "start": 402.319, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
