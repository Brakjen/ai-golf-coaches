{"chunk": "we go left right left here we go left right left", "start": 18.4, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "pretty good that was a awesome shot like that one right there bottle it welcome back to beautiful Superstition Mountain Milo here with my", "start": 31.84, "duration": 19.399}
{"chunk": "assistant Henry and we have an awesome lesson for you walking you through the keys to be able to get to your lead side", "start": 46.36, "duration": 15.56}
{"chunk": "every single time this is something that's going to help you create better low point and really compress the golf", "start": 54.64, "duration": 17.559}
{"chunk": "ball mhm I want to first walk you through why this concept is so important so let's just show them what happens if", "start": 62.84, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "we don't do the correct motion so if you wind up and you're camped out on your Trail side and now you try to move into", "start": 71.439, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "the ball you can see you're going to you're going to hit the ground behind the ball oh that was nice yeah you you fatted it and thinned it all at once all", "start": 80.04, "duration": 19.16}
{"chunk": "at once and then you hooked it drop kick hook yeah but it went up in the air yeah it was", "start": 89.52, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "terrible so if we really want to be able to touch that ball first get the ball on the face before we hit the ground y", "start": 98.2, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "there's only a really one way to do it we've got to be able to have our angle of attack or angle of approach coming in so that low point is going to happen", "start": 107.56, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "somewhere out in front of that golf yeah if anything if you are getting too far back maybe make it too far forward for a second well there's a direct correlation", "start": 117.479, "duration": 18.439}
{"chunk": "I've seen some studies on how far out in front and how good your handicap is oh really interesting yes so the worst player the farther", "start": 125.719, "duration": 18.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "back I I could see that the better the player the farther forward tour players are generally hitting the ground their low points like 4 inches or more out", "start": 135.28, "duration": 15.959000000000001}
{"chunk": "front of the yeah way out there well then you're taking a variable out of Play Almost you're taking the that grass a little bit early out of play and then", "start": 143.599, "duration": 18.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "even if you thin it it's a different type of thin your Club is still working down into the ball so you still get a little spin you still get a little", "start": 153.239, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "height maybe in a different way ball still goes out if you come in this way and thin it it's not that Leading Edge thin that goes on the ground right", "start": 161.68, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "that's where we want to be coming from and it all goes back to getting that pressure back to the lead side often", "start": 170.04, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "times for most golfers earlier way earlier and there are some keys to how we get back earlier so let's start", "start": 176.8, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "walking them through a little step by step how we do it yeah and the downshift board which you know is beneath my feet obviously here is probably the best tool", "start": 185.4, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "for this just to feel it you don't have to hit balls with it right out of the gate and as you saw even that first one I hit it kind of spun a little bit you don't necessarily want to hit full speed", "start": 194.64, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "off of this but it's great for creating a little bit of the laterals um creating the back and forth for with the pressure your pressure is also moving kind of", "start": 203.36, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "this way as well yeah it's it's 3D but for for the average golfer right off right out of the gate let's just try to get a little bit of the laterals taken care of cuz you're not getting back left", "start": 212.72, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "that's what's happening I call that learning to have flow yes most players have no flow and so we've we've got to", "start": 222.239, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "learn to dance with our golf club and so we're winding and as we're completing our wind up we're we're actually beginning to", "start": 229.68, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "fall back to the front side right it's got to happen in the back swing so the left move is not a downswing move it's", "start": 237.799, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "actually a back swing move ah there we go the recipe the secret so we're actually using what we see is that most", "start": 246.159, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "people use their right side or their right foot right leg to late and not early enough so what we mean by that is", "start": 254.2, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "they camp out over here I love that camp out so they camp out over here and then they're pushing off their right side to", "start": 262.72, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "start the down swing they're trying to go left and swing down all at one time it's just so now they get the old tilt", "start": 270.96, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "going on oh yeah and now the low Point's behind the ball so you can see that club working up through the ball and if it wasn't a mat here I would have a lot", "start": 278.08, "duration": 17.559}
{"chunk": "more trouble but because we're on a mat I might be able to get away with that kind of so that's the one you usually see at your driving ranges right now if", "start": 287.32, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "we use our right foot a little earlier which we see from most of the great ball Strikers ball Strikers World Long Drive", "start": 297.039, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "Pros they're getting Max Trailside pressure right about here yeah going back early so it's pushing them into", "start": 305.28, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "their windup and now the way I love that you say it all the time Milo is like a swing set so when that swing is getting up to the top there's a", "start": 314.08, "duration": 20.319999999999997}
{"chunk": "float okay so we're we're floating up to the top and that then falls into our lead side 100% Henry so you're winding", "start": 323.84, "duration": 21.36}
{"chunk": "mhm and as you're completing your wind you begin to float and fall so your arms feel like they continue to float up and", "start": 335.12, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "you fall as you fall down yes so now I'm using like gravity becomes my friend yes and it carries that club again it gets", "start": 343.88, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "the low Point more forward and I don't have to work so hard for it if you're hanging back out here you yeah your hands and arms are going to have to take", "start": 353.759, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "over yeah you're going to have to throw the club to the ball because you're essentially moving your low point from here to like here it just doesn't work", "start": 361.56, "duration": 18.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "and when you do this correctly your centers so your this mic and your belt will get stacked up in transition yeah", "start": 371.16, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "so you're going to be you got the right on that logo yeah so now you're you got pressure forward yes you got your centers forward so now you can turn and", "start": 378.12, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "burn and smack that ball right where if you're back here you got a figure out how to go that way and swing it's too complicated and that's a really important point you just made about our", "start": 386.4, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "Center so our rib cage and you see this amongst a lot of the top Pros we actually want to get almost in front of our pelvis right there in transition or", "start": 394.599, "duration": 19.762}
{"chunk": "at least stacked up if this you can get pressure left so my pressure is left but if I hang back I'm still going to have", "start": 404.56, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "low Point issues my upper Center is now to back yeah so we want to make sure that how we get left is", "start": 412.639, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "proper right so I can get left where I'm still on top with my chest that's going to get my low point where we want it so", "start": 420.44, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "you can see how I finish stacked up over here you know almost finishing on my left side more or less yes we especially need that with the ball off the ground", "start": 430.36, "duration": 19.719}
{"chunk": "yes that's the one big key we've got to get stacked up yeah cuz getting our body stacked up", "start": 439.44, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "also allows us to be able to rotate yes if we're tilted you can't tilt and rotate very well they don't go together", "start": 448.08, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "no chest do does not want to turn from here no it stops yeah so essentially Milo the sequence of this how I like to", "start": 456.8, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "kind of get on this board and use it properly one again one I'm not hitting balls full out and let's just start without the ball for a second and some", "start": 465.8, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "air swings where I'll be above the ball I start a little left that's kind of like my trigger so just like we see from the great players of old there's a", "start": 474.319, "duration": 18.441}
{"chunk": "little trigger left left and then you go right and then right but right's done pretty soon pretty early so getting that pressure a", "start": 483.72, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "little start left that kind of gives me a Quee to get back there too which I like so a little left right and now you", "start": 493.0, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "can see that board it's not quite maxing out over there until I get closer to the start of the down swing it really slams down when you change direction right but", "start": 501.36, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "it's it's moving that way you can see it's starting to level out sort of in the back swing it's begins to Teeter back and that's that that little float", "start": 510.4, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "that we talked about so then I can just fall and turn out of the way so if I go slow with it here little left right left", "start": 519.36, "duration": 20.161}
{"chunk": "so that's creating that little change of pressure that Dynamic athletic sequence that we're looking for and getting our", "start": 529.36, "duration": 15.518999999999998}
{"chunk": "low point forward that's where we want it to our left side right all good things yes how about you hit one Milo you're the flow", "start": 537.72, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "master okay I see one from you so I'm going to do the same kind of thing you did first I'm going to start just getting the feel for left right", "start": 545.2, "duration": 20.520999999999997}
{"chunk": "left swing okay now we apply cool not bad", "start": 555.88, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "all right one more I'm going to widen my base so we can really see that that board and I usually put the ball a little forward to that logo because I", "start": 575.8, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "want to if anything I want to exaggerate that so I got to go up and get it I don't want to have the ball too far back which too many people own do too yeah", "start": 583.92, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "they cheat it they're like oh I'll move it back they'll get my I keep hitting behind it so I'm just going to keep moving it farther back now you got a lot of other issues so", "start": 592.399, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "here we go left right left and I can just walk through that yeah if I wanted to nice here we go left", "start": 600.04, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "right left so that's fun good really good tool that kind of coaches for us we don't have to sit yeah the step drills we", "start": 610.8, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "really love heel Taps we really love and that's how you would then transfer this exactly that's that's how you can step off the board and use the same principle", "start": 625.2, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "but for for those of you that are still at the Starting Gate and want to get to the Finish Line use this first this will get you you know through that first", "start": 634.2, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "phase so to speak and on then on your way yep 100% so one last thing that I want to really drive home is that it's", "start": 642.16, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "pretty much impossible for us to be able to to turn through the shot if we don't get left oh yeah but once we do once", "start": 650.8, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "we've actually created the land left now it's important that we do just turn out of the way yes that's going to help move that low point forward even more MH and", "start": 659.36, "duration": 19.8}
{"chunk": "really make those strikes good yep that rotation will help get that low Point more forward as well so you really can't turn efficiently unless we get stacked", "start": 669.48, "duration": 19.078}
{"chunk": "up if we don't get stacked up we can't turn but once we do we need to go ahead and let ourselves get out of the way otherwise if we hang back and twist and", "start": 679.079, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "turn now we got ouchies and we don't want those no we don't like that so if we get stacked up it's more of an efficient turn and you know we can just get around", "start": 687.399, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "that corner little something like that yeah well hopefully you all at home learn something here and you can apply it and", "start": 697.12, "duration": 16.599}
