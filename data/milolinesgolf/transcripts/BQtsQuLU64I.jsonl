{"chunk": "is the club racing by them is surpassing them so you see a lot of this trying to get the club to go low left and the club", "start": 167.599, "duration": 20.401}
{"chunk": "Races by them yes it's rare and we we don't see it a lot but it's not much different than the same person who swings way up and out to the right", "start": 177.08, "duration": 17.321}
{"chunk": "believe it or not they're not that dissimilar yeah there's some similar patterns there just both of them have the club flying by them right so one is", "start": 186.36, "duration": 16.999}
{"chunk": "out exit way out to the right so that one I blocked but I could have hooked it from there just easy that path if you just Square the face up that's a hook", "start": 194.159, "duration": 17.08}

{"chunk": "whether it's out to the right or it's low and left now the interesting thing is in every good golf swing the club", "start": 225.799, "duration": 15.56}
{"chunk": "does beat our body it always is racing past us but the overtaking rate needs to be matched up better yeah if my body basically stops the overtaking rate is", "start": 234.079, "duration": 20.041}
{"chunk": "too fast so that club just blows by us and that's where we typically see things break down whether it's the the lead wrist the lead elbow you're pulling this", "start": 243.84, "duration": 20.319}
{"chunk": "thing in the rotation stalls your swing feels unnatural well if your rotation stops what's that club want to do it wants to run into the ground behind the ball right yeah", "start": 254.0, "duration": 18.681}
{"chunk": "sure yep and so then your your arms are reacting to try to pull it back out of the ground because we know we in a good swing the grip is getting pulled up that", "start": 263.08, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "around piece really neutralizes a lot of things a lot of people that have this problem where their exits two out and up to the right their path is like I had a", "start": 273.199, "duration": 20.799}

{"chunk": "day it's pretty good yeah so Henry I want to let's just take a step back and revisit that student who had his T his path 10 out to the right", "start": 291.16, "duration": 18.558}
{"chunk": "wind up oh my gosh come on give me a fist pump there nice job let's walk through what was he actually doing well he had a few things", "start": 315.84, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "number one you know his face was a little shut which we see a lot y with people are too into out they start whether it's aiming right or shutting", "start": 328.919, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "the face they have to then swing more right to make up for that club face his face was shut at a dress yeah so that's that's thing number one his Club face", "start": 337.52, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "was hooded hooded yep so imagine imagine I'm aiming this club behind me if I need to go straight I better swing way out to", "start": 345.68, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "the right yes so it's just a response number one right out of the gate yeah right out of the gate then the the way he responded was he would really turn", "start": 354.08, "duration": 16.361}
{"chunk": "back flat oh big time he turned back flat and with a low arm super low hands and arms yes and then from here he actually would keep his back more or", "start": 362.28, "duration": 16.918000000000003}
{"chunk": "less to the Target forever and he lowered his arms more his arms would lower and now that club's coming from behind his foot so you're talking lowo", "start": 370.919, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "problems yeah you're talking big old hooks for him cuz his face was shut so it's kind of like that yeah for him balls on the ground were tough to hit", "start": 379.639, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "solid he actually was a good driver yep but balls on the ground were tough to hit solid he his low point would be behind it and everything was a big old hook I'm not even sure I can replicate", "start": 387.919, "duration": 19.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "what he was doing oh shanked it that was pretty good path though let me try again that's what he was doing there you go just like that that's the", "start": 397.639, "duration": 18.761}
{"chunk": "ball big old push hook and that was the only one that was in the repertoire that's what he had so what did we do to fix it well so number one we fixed face right off the gate", "start": 407.319, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "that was number one had to fix that yep okay and then once we fixed that face his ball started going big old pushes exactly so then we had to start matching", "start": 416.72, "duration": 19.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "up the other parts in swing the biggest thing we did was really build this road map for him so you guys are after that low left", "start": 426.24, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "exit we get it but you have to understand how we move our middle is that's what's creating it so for him we really focused on the hands just", "start": 442.84, "duration": 18.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "staying up because I didn't want them drop in from the inside and shut off yeah everybody's hands are going to come down enough sure so for him he needed to", "start": 452.44, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "feel like his hands floated a little bit more he just left them up okay so hands stay up and then just turn the corner feel like you're turning right into that", "start": 460.36, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "wall good good I built this road map for him so you can see I have a little Cor corner", "start": 469.639, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "here so imagine your swing is on an arc we know that eventually it has to go back up and around to the left for a right-and golfer up the plane but our", "start": 479.84, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "arms need to be transported by rotation so that's where we needed to we feel like the arm stay up and the right and then the chest now becomes a little bit", "start": 489.24, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "more of a carrier it transports the golf club so we we put this road map on the ground I use this with a lot of golfers it seems like almost every day I coach", "start": 496.8, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "now Milo I I build something like this it a great visual okay I need to feel like my chest or in this case you could", "start": 505.72, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "say my mic traces the line through the ball and around the corner okay almost like if I was going to throw the club back behind me in the desert yep and", "start": 514.88, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "where we were teaching this school there's a wall behind where this student was swinging and I kept telling him I just want you to feel like you're going to throw that club into that wall behind", "start": 525.48, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "you yep and it felt dramatic to him but he was still swinging in out most of the time for a student has that pattern yeah they've got you got to feel like you're", "start": 534.04, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "exaggerating to you're you're feeling like you're almost coming over the top for some guys like that which is scary for a lot of folks we get that yeah but", "start": 542.56, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "as long as the risk conditions are somewhat in order and they're not applying something else for him he was just his hands were kind of lowering too", "start": 551.6, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "much but his wrist conditions were all right he's not going to get over the top as much as people think he's going to get over the top Yeah his lowering rate was just way too fast relative to his", "start": 559.399, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "rotation right so that's why feeling like he keeps his arms up and rotates more matched up for this player", "start": 568.36, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "yes wow up oh my gosh come on give me a fist bump there nice job and for many of you if you're", "start": 578.839, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "struggling with blocks and hooks yes the feel of hand staying up and added rotation will be good medicine it's", "start": 591.04, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "actually G to neutralize you because your path's probably weighing out all right so I got some more balls Milo I'm gonna increase the difficulty on this", "start": 600.44, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "exercise a little bit just for a little fun so let's say the ball is right about here okay okay another little thing I might add to", "start": 610.32, "duration": 18.44}
{"chunk": "this is sticking a alignment stick in the ground relatively close to parallel to", "start": 618.76, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "my club now you've got to stay under and you know at first I might not make this too hard for or too difficult for the student but this gives them again a", "start": 626.12, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "good road map if they especially if they're the one that obviously goes up and out to the right with the high exit right and they're hitting blocks", "start": 636.48, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "and hooks that way I'm going to make them feel like they're going down and around with that chest and that's what's", "start": 645.12, "duration": 17.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "bringing that handle and Club in low and left it's not me dragging the club in and left cuz that's when we get the", "start": 653.44, "duration": 15.561}

{"chunk": "that line it's a little close to me technically it's going to be a little more out here but that's the feeling and", "start": 775.519, "duration": 15.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "that carries the club into the ball it's not me pushing the club down that line that's when we're cheating it y you know", "start": 782.44, "duration": 18.997999999999998}
