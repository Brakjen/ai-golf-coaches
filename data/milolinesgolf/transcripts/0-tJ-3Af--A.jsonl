{"chunk": "harder for us to use our legs as brakes to re-center ourselves the opposite direction as that weight and speed is moving this direction because you know", "start": 69.9, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "if we have a slow back swing and if I'm going slow I have no impetus to go that way any dynamically yes so I end up seeing a lot of this", "start": 79.08, "duration": 17.16}
