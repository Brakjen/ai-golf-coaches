{"chunk": "well there's quite a few dynamics here so a pressure shift is", "start": 38.32, "duration": 16.319}

{"chunk": "the other one we see a lot of is players who slide their lower half really forward to get pressure under their their front", "start": 129.2, "duration": 16.16}

{"chunk": "pressure shift would be more of a dynamic pressure shift where we're sinking into the ground there is a slight motion lateral but only slight", "start": 154.08, "duration": 18.959}
