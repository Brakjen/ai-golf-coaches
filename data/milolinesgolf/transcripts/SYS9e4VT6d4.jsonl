{"chunk": "[Music] awesome henry so i love this topic yeah this is one you talk a lot about", "start": 17.95, "duration": 16.21}
{"chunk": "yeah for those who actually come and take a lesson live they get to see what i really am talking about because most people think you know milo's just all", "start": 26.72, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "about get open rotation well i am but you got to do it right well i think at the root of your", "start": 34.48, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "method or philosophy is athleticism yes and to me this is the main part that people kind of miss out on and if they put a", "start": 43.04, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "little bit of this magic dust into their golf swing things will start to match up a little more naturally for sure and so i call it", "start": 52.48, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "flow so when students come show up what i'm looking for a lot of times i like to watch swings just with my eyes i don't need a video camera", "start": 60.239, "duration": 15.841999999999999}
{"chunk": "and i'm just watching the how the motion flows and ties together and if it looks athletic or not because what i see a lot is people swing up", "start": 68.56, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "and their backswing is a backswing and their downswing is a separate thing it's a downswing so i thought it was two", "start": 77.2, "duration": 15.238999999999999}
{"chunk": "swings so an analogy i like to use and you you saw me use this one the other day was yeah in a", "start": 84.84, "duration": 17.961}
{"chunk": "lesson in a lesson was writing a swing because it's something that we all have done at least most everybody i know when they were kids got on a swing and rode", "start": 93.28, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "the swing and i asked the question so when you ride in the swing when you get to the top what does it feel like and the guy's like oh it feels like you're floating and i was like", "start": 101.92, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "there you go so when we're swinging a golf club i want your hands and arms and the club to feel like they", "start": 110.88, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "are floating for that little bit at the top so we're patient we're not yanking them down it's we swing it up", "start": 118.479, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "we feel this little float and we then we come down so we're pouring the energy on smoothly not mm-hmm", "start": 126.56, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "another one would be like thinking of those little balls that are hanging from ropes that you have and maybe like a lawyer's office or something", "start": 135.68, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "and you know they kind of take a break and play with that thing you know like when it when you pull it back up and the ball", "start": 144.4, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "comes off it kind of like you said it comes up it looks like it floats for a second then it comes back down right so there's no herky-jerky action there is", "start": 152.08, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "no you know one drill that we'll use sometimes maybe not as much as", "start": 160.16, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "some other people out there but is a freezer drill so there is more of an up set it", "start": 168.16, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "freeze and then down okay but quickly into that sort of rehearsal or drill we add flow back into", "start": 176.0, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "it and if anything i like to do pump drills one where the pump isn't a pump it's a little different but where", "start": 185.36, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "there is a little flow to it kind of like i'm almost making multiple swings before i go and hit the ball and that's a great way to do it another thing i", "start": 194.159, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "like to do is actually make the golf club feel like a swing so i get it in my hands it's loose", "start": 202.08, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "i get motion going from side to side and i feel the club moving in a weightless way and just synchronized to my motion so i", "start": 209.04, "duration": 17.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "i'm going to get out your way here why don't you show them face on the look of that where you kind of almost have the club pass you first", "start": 220.08, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "so i feel like i go and you can see as i'm doing this my i'm shifting pressure ahead of the club and i'm letting it get a little bigger", "start": 226.959, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "and if you make that make start from the beginning again if you do that little motion before just make some little ones for me real quick little ones", "start": 242.72, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "so i could almost come up here and grab that because it there is that there's no it's not moving fast right there it's kind of slow right", "start": 251.68, "duration": 18.878}
{"chunk": "so we we want the speed to be later more down through the ball right um so many of you are trying to", "start": 260.639, "duration": 17.602}
{"chunk": "accelerate to me that's a word in golf i get kind of tired of hearing but accelerate from the top right", "start": 269.28, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "but there needs to be a little more flow to that motion man you see it in tour players yeah look great examples looks effortless the ball", "start": 278.56, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "jumps now when you actually go through they accelerate the golf club but the way they do it it's the sequence of the motion", "start": 286.4, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "it's all a chain they're not the outer part of the wheel let's just if we use our body as a wheel they don't put torque into the outer", "start": 294.88, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "part of the wheel the torque is coming from there within from their middle and it's gradually working itself out into the", "start": 303.6, "duration": 16.801}

{"chunk": "yeah am i coordinating enough to do it on camera i think so okay i think you've probably done it before so what i'm gonna do", "start": 319.44, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "is it in line let me talk about this real quick in line with pulling down and getting fast with the hands and arms from the top another thing people think", "start": 327.039, "duration": 19.76}
{"chunk": "is that they get on this rotation thing that we talk about a lot right but when we talk about rotation i think it's", "start": 336.479, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "important that we separate rotation later on in the swing and the separation we're creating versus", "start": 345.039, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "spinning from the top you get a lot of people thinking that we try to get the chest open immediately right yeah you can't do that", "start": 354.96, "duration": 19.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "and hit it well but yeah there's some key things that the pressure has to flow back to the front foot right before the rotations", "start": 364.319, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "starts to happen if i just turn back and i start to spin i'm in deep doo-doo i'm gonna hit pull slices everything bad well that's why and again", "start": 373.84, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "some of these two things this getting pulled left quickly and this go together", "start": 383.44, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "so that little pause or delay at the top that the change in flow", "start": 390.88, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "and as we sequence we're staying closed just for a little bit there and i think that's important for you guys to uh", "start": 399.12, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "understand so how i'm going to get you to feel that is i'm going to have you take a swing to the top nice and slow and all i'm going to do is kind of put a", "start": 407.28, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "little pressure on your left shoulder just to keep you a little turned for a second as you begin to", "start": 416.08, "duration": 17.599999999999998}

{"chunk": "pick my hand out of the way huh how'd you hit that one i hit it good so this is actually an exercise i've", "start": 434.72, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "seen you do before too and that also gets everything moving up from the ground yeah so i'm", "start": 443.919, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "this is still winding for just a little split second extra while i'm starting to land my force to my forward", "start": 455.44, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "foot and almost feel like i'm kind of sitting just a little bit back my pelvis so for a second the back is still to the target", "start": 462.96, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "you know that's how you could kind of think of it if i was looking at the camera here for just a second and then this pulls everything along", "start": 472.24, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "so when the the old-timers like jack nicklaus and some of those guys said they felt like they kept their back to the target that's what they meant but what they", "start": 481.28, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "really meant is they they gave themselves time to get their pressure back to the forward foot so then they could unwind they didn't try to keep it there and", "start": 489.28, "duration": 17.119}
