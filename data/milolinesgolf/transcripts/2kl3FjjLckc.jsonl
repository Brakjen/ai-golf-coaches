{"chunk": "adding these pieces together right so I'm going to puzzle them together and then once you've kind of got the puzzle organized and put together then you have to figure out how to speed it up again", "start": 186.78, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "so when you say slow house slow are we talking a lot slower than most people think I have people show up on The Practice Tee all the time yeah and when", "start": 194.519, "duration": 18.121000000000002}

{"chunk": "the mat all right let me try that I don't know if I can go that slow so do you want the whole motion that slow or do you want it more slow at the bottom", "start": 222.12, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "want it all slow oh boy it's like first we're just puzzling it together too far now that would hit the fence", "start": 229.44, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "about seven yards eight yards that was good so and then what you can do as you slow it down is take a video of yourself and see if you're doing it right once", "start": 239.94, "duration": 17.461}

{"chunk": "but it still feels a little wider to me than previously like driver yeah the other thing I'm working on a little bit is the club face because it I get tend to get a", "start": 319.86, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "little closed towards the top gets a little crossed up right yeah so we're going to keep the face Feeling Just a Little More", "start": 329.58, "duration": 16.141}

{"chunk": "okay at the top I'm gonna feel like it's not crossed up and I'm gonna feel like the face is a", "start": 347.46, "duration": 15.779000000000002}
{"chunk": "little more back at you versus back at the camera yeah so that's kind of what I'm feeling with the club face and what do you feel in transition in transition I'm kind of", "start": 355.5, "duration": 18.9}

{"chunk": "difference and you can see that you do it so what I would be doing here is to get that club the way I want at the top I might look at it a little bit just to", "start": 440.039, "duration": 18.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "make sure okay it feels nice and wide Club face is more back at you Milo and then I would make some of these", "start": 448.319, "duration": 16.298000000000002}

{"chunk": "video too and make sure my my rehearsals are really good yeah you make sure you're you're doing what you're trying to do or even exaggerating the feel of what", "start": 477.539, "duration": 18.341}
{"chunk": "you're trying to do a little bit so that was nice and slow yeah that was good and my favorite ones are actually slow motion all one motion so once you can do", "start": 489.419, "duration": 18.822000000000003}
{"chunk": "a little pump and you can train yourself to do the pieces then you have to kind of start coupling it all together but slow", "start": 508.259, "duration": 17.381}
{"chunk": "yeah that's money right there and the it takes some attention out so you can really feel the club head you'll get a little better understanding and", "start": 519.3, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "awareness with the club face so for me that felt like it was back to the right of me the arm sort of felt like they stayed back not down but", "start": 531.6, "duration": 19.459}
{"chunk": "it's where up and back so you'll just get a lot more awareness of what's going on when you can slow it down yeah that's perfect so this is where", "start": 540.959, "duration": 19.48}
{"chunk": "again video we'd go watch it say yes no got to add a little this take away some of that feedback's key you gotta have a", "start": 556.2, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "feedback loop so you can see it put a feel to what it looks like and then come back and do it again and you keep progressing and then over time once you", "start": 564.36, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "start to get it to look how you want slow start speeding it up slightly and just see what happens and it usually for most", "start": 572.82, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
