{"chunk": "i'm gonna show the relief so it goes here here how to release a golf club okay so this", "start": 0.24, "duration": 15.602}
{"chunk": "is something that comes up quite often we're trying to train people to pivot and to try to take the hands and arms out of it right so you can build some trust and", "start": 17.199, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "some foundations on how you get around the corner but that's not the full package that's not the end of the line that's that's just developing body", "start": 26.16, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "motions so now as we want to get energy out into this thing so we can send it we want to put that we want to we want to mash that golf ball we've got to learn how to get rid of angles", "start": 35.36, "duration": 17.999999999999996}
{"chunk": "so that's in our in our language the release or a release is getting rid of the angles that we've created right so as we've", "start": 44.96, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "made a back swing we've we've set these levers we've added in trail wrist extension and whatever that's done to our lead wrist you know whether it", "start": 52.719, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "depends on how we grip it so that's too complicated to get into right this minute but we've created an angle okay yes now as we swing down we want to use our body", "start": 60.8, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "to transport the angle but we want to let the angle out go at some point so what is happening there well as we're starting to in our", "start": 70.08, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "transition as we start down and we have extension in that trail wrist what we're trying to do is we're trying to get around the corner and not roll release", "start": 79.52, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "it this way because then that kicks path out and too much facial rotation we're trying to get around the corner and let this thing", "start": 88.56, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "go this way because we release our angles in this fashion not this fashion so i wanted to talk", "start": 96.4, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "about that historically in golf instruction we've been taught that we want to get the club toe up", "start": 103.52, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "toe up what does that require of me lots of roll and lots of face rotation a lot of forearm roll and a lot of face rotation yeah", "start": 111.439, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "that's a timing based thing right very much so can that be done yes you can be you can get really good at it there have been plenty of tour players throughout", "start": 120.079, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "history who have done it right now that's their full-time job they practice a lot there's a lot of timing they better have good tempo good rhythm and they better practice a lot so they", "start": 128.479, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "maintain that right now our preference would be to kind of move away from the rolling type release", "start": 136.319, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "and into more of a pattern where our trail wrist goes into extension with minimal forearm roll and goes from extension", "start": 143.44, "duration": 16.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "to flexion so it does this somewhat like what other sports do we see that pattern happening", "start": 152.0, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "in oh my gosh like all of them it's darn air so shooting a hoop yep you don't do this no you don't you", "start": 160.879, "duration": 17.202}
{"chunk": "don't do that to shoot a hoop throw in a ball if i'm throwing a fastball my wrist works like this yes", "start": 169.2, "duration": 18.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "now that's not the only pitch that pitchers throw yeah they are constantly spinning the ball but if i want the ball to fly relatively flat and straight", "start": 178.239, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "it's this pattern it's this pattern if i want to curve it now i can i can do other things correct okay ideally we kind of want our golf ball to", "start": 186.72, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "go kind of straight i think preferable trouble then we want to curve it so we do we don't want to hang on to these angles forever though no", "start": 195.519, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "no the idea and i think a lot of people get that as a misnomer they they see us do foundation ones and twos and they say well there's no pop in the bat and", "start": 204.48, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "they're trying to get you guys oh they're just trying to make you hold on to the angles well okay when you're painting by the numbers and beginning to understand how the body", "start": 212.64, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "actually pivots yeah maybe i'll agree to you but in reality that's not what happens we want you to learn how to move because most people", "start": 221.76, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "are applying this pattern right yep so in an effort to kind of delete that pattern and hit the reboot", "start": 230.0, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "button we say okay hands and arms off yeah let's turn the body on for a minute", "start": 238.959, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "okay now let's get the hands and arms back in now here's a question for you i get this all the time", "start": 247.76, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "how do you release we understand that we're going from extension to flexion but is this something that's muscular am i physically pushing that golf club to", "start": 255.92, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "make it go no no no you're not if i'm driving the body by my pivot and as this starts to stop", "start": 263.759, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "and push away then that will happen but you're never going to unless you're if your hands and arms driven that's different if your hands and arms yes", "start": 272.16, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "you're going to manually manipulate it but then i'm not moving my body yeah that's why we learned to do foundation ones and twos perfect and if our pivot", "start": 280.56, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "is working properly and there is no real tension in the system this unwinds right absolutely i really", "start": 288.16, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "can't keep it from it because the way that things work is i am loading down into the ground and turning the corner when i begin to post on this front leg", "start": 296.4, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "and push myself up back and away it puts some torques into the grip right absolutely voila the thing releases", "start": 304.639, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "it's something i've really never thought about i've never thought about trying to make my hands go like that but if you film it they go", "start": 312.88, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "you go pretty fast yeah they do so that's what's happening and your hands are a reaction of your body pivot your body pivots at a very very quick", "start": 320.4, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "rate and it has no chance you know we know that the club actually gains weight in space right and that honestly unless you", "start": 329.6, "duration": 15.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "potentially break your wrist or you're an incredibly strong person which is pretty rare it's hard to hold it off that if you're pivoting hard and pushing away you're not going to be able to hold", "start": 337.039, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "that off if you go slow maybe but as we speed up the machine it starts to unwind on its own power", "start": 345.6, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "yeah absolutely now the key is getting it to unwind correctly so that we don't introduce too much twist into the equation right okay", "start": 354.0, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "and to get that we want to invite you all over to milolinesgolf.com so we're going to create a series on how to train this", "start": 362.08, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "release pattern there you go we wanted to throw this out there so you can see what our preferred release looks like right i'm going to show the relief", "start": 370.0, "duration": 18.96}
