{"chunk": "how that happens so let's go into detail okay so let's first talk about what i see is confusion", "start": 54.96, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "so i see people wanting to circle their whole entire arm unit in this way it's like a whole", "start": 63.84, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "system windmill sort of yeah so it's like their arm is doing this right in the swing when in reality what we're after here", "start": 72.88, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "our hands are still working on this nice plane they're basically up the plane down the plane maybe even a little in and over the plane is my preferred", "start": 82.64, "duration": 19.599}
{"chunk": "but i don't want the club to go in and over i'd like to see the club actually do the opposite of what our hands are doing kind of really so the club head is", "start": 92.64, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "actually traveling on a slightly different path that's what we're getting at here the head doesn't necessarily go the same exact direction as the hands the whole time so as i'm swinging back", "start": 101.68, "duration": 18.880000000000003}

{"chunk": "fairly square yeah we don't have to open it up to shallow it but like i said like we were saying i", "start": 161.68, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "think a lot of people get in this this thought that they have to shallow the club with their arms", "start": 170.0, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "and get the club back behind us with our arms but the problem is is when you do that it's gonna be hard to hit the golf ball consistently from a position like that", "start": 178.48, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "don't you think could be you know your arms are getting a little bit too sucked across you your right arm is getting a little bit more behind you than we probably want it", "start": 187.76, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "the other thing i find is that when people start doing that not only can it get a little behind you but because the hands drop so much", "start": 196.879, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "the low point becomes an issue right ball first contact becomes an issue this club actually isn't up enough", "start": 205.84, "duration": 15.681000000000001}

{"chunk": "gets way out like this now it's i've got to do some magic to get to that ball yeah this is not going", "start": 263.36, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "this is going out there not there i think of a guy like uh justin thomas recent pga champion", "start": 271.28, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "and he's got very upright swing right which can be great for major championships we know especially out of the rough and stuff but", "start": 278.639, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "even as high up as that club is in transition he still has that bit of a circle at the top because he leaves it up in his wrist", "start": 286.8, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "make that little motion right but the club isn't going down to the ground his arms aren't going straight down", "start": 294.88, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "right it's more or less the arms the hands and arms are dropping and turning with his body yeah they're kind of going along for the ride", "start": 302.72, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "i would say yes they're they're not they swing independently but they don't get their energy from themselves so they don't do this yeah", "start": 311.68, "duration": 19.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "they get energized by what this is doing yeah now some of you that are watching may have had a lesson with me and we've talked about this where if you do", "start": 321.12, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "some of the drills we talk about our site let's say the pump drill or any of the reflexing stuff it happens", "start": 330.0, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "when we do that the hands and arms happen to just move down because of that sitting", "start": 337.919, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "and starting to unwind it's my hands aren't dropping because i put them there they they drop because i'm actually lowering my whole my whole center", "start": 345.36, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "your whole mass comes down a little bit and pivots yeah and then these catch the energy and they do actually accelerate", "start": 355.28, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "and go faster than this goes right which is why some i would say there is some confusion out there because you can look at gears and say okay these go faster", "start": 363.68, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "bow eye and i'd say it's because they catch the energy it's like when i throw i don't do this my", "start": 373.28, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "my arm catches that energy and it and it becomes energized and it goes really fast right so let's actually demonstrate doing this circle drill for", "start": 381.6, "duration": 16.718}
{"chunk": "everybody so that they can see how yes how i want it to work so for me the reason we do this first of all is probably you're tending to", "start": 390.639, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "circle the club the wrong way so you're wanting to go steeper so we're going to have you make some circles and i would just have", "start": 399.919, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "you just sit here and circle the club a few times can you turn to the camera and do that so i want you guys to note that his", "start": 409.039, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "hands are relatively in the same spot yet the club is still traveling the club head is traveling a long distance yes and so i i like to start people with", "start": 415.759, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "make a little backswing and then just sit here and make some circles and then about the fourth or fifth circle we're going to turn and make a swing no ball", "start": 426.319, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "and then once we can do that we're going to do a couple and we're going to hit the ball don't worry about how you hit it i", "start": 435.039, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "hooked that for many of you that would be a welcome thing to actually hit one that turned left but that's where we start we start with", "start": 443.68, "duration": 18.322}
{"chunk": "these little circles and then swing and now we're going to take away the standing back here and just circling it and we're going to make it stand up", "start": 456.479, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "and circle and hit the golf ball and you'll start to see okay that club yeah definitely you better believe it's going to feel different to you if it", "start": 465.44, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "doesn't feel different then you're not doing anything different most likely so do more we really want to feel", "start": 474.479, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "this and what we want to avoid is this windmills super windmills of the arms because the", "start": 483.759, "duration": 17.762999999999998}
{"chunk": "arms actually will start affecting our bends and our body so if if i do this with my arms now my body bent the wrong way and i'm going to have a tendency to", "start": 493.28, "duration": 17.918}
{"chunk": "bottom out way back behind right if we can limit it to wrist and forearm motion that really doesn't travel up the chain", "start": 501.919, "duration": 15.842000000000002}
{"chunk": "too much and start affecting how our body bends yeah because we like to see things turn relatively symmetrical right yes and", "start": 511.36, "duration": 18.318}
{"chunk": "what i see happen is when i see a lot of hands and arms raising and lowering in the golf swing i tend to see a flat shoulder turn yeah", "start": 519.839, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "because it offsets it because you need this club to work down somehow yes right because we're on this plane", "start": 529.92, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "if it was a baseball swing we we would know to swing around us so something is a change to get us down but a lot of you guys change with this", "start": 538.16, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "to make that happen versus using our turn in our bends and and still swinging around us", "start": 547.6, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "yeah so the lowering i think gets a little confusing sometimes because they're trying to lower the club with their hands and arms and then their shoulder", "start": 555.6, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "plane's pretty flat that's why added hip flexion yeah the squeeze video we did is is actually so important", "start": 564.64, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "because you lower the club by flexing not by necessarily lowering your arms now there are players on tour you can always find the odd yeah one that breaks", "start": 572.32, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "the rules because they used a different match up there's you can match anything up it's just harder and sometimes less dynamic so let's", "start": 581.68, "duration": 19.518}
{"chunk": "we're trying to do things efficient so i would prefer to see the club's mask getting behind you with just how your forearms and wrists are", "start": 590.959, "duration": 17.202}
{"chunk": "working and your body being just very symmetrical just turns and turns and you put force into the right left and you're just", "start": 600.24, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "turning nice and natural i think all right milo i got to do a circle okay do some circles for me so there we got the club circle in oh", "start": 608.24, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "circled it into butter you almost got to feel it a little bit in the wrist first and then you can start to use the body but it's a that's a tough drill it really is well that's", "start": 627.76, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "why i isolate first i have them just learn to circle it without even thinking about a ball or their body yep just feel how to circle it", "start": 637.2, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "because for many that's going to be like tough that was actually really good i chunked it here but that was that one i when i did it i", "start": 647.44, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "got down and flexed a little bit more it was good tricky drill but it's something that may really help you guys start to", "start": 656.88, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "use your wrists in a better condition and get that center mass back behind you for once so instead of pushing it out it's going to be", "start": 665.36, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "falling back yeah and make sure you guys watch that door knob video again this drill will go right in line with that so i'll link that video so you can watch", "start": 674.56, "duration": 16.48}
