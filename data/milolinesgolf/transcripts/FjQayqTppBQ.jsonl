{"chunk": "[Music] all right milo so uh getting some questions about sort of arm structure especially in the backswing and", "start": 9.03, "duration": 15.459}
{"chunk": "transition what's going on there you know a lot of people kind of think that the arms sort of need to be pinned down and connected to us right i think", "start": 18.8, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "connection's a word you hear a lot uh in golf training or golf instruction nowadays yeah you know it", "start": 26.88, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "has its place especially in smaller shots but as the shots grow and as we go to hit the ball harder there's probably going to be some freedom in the arms", "start": 35.12, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "actually like if i was going to take a ball and throw it really hard i'll just pretend i'm going to throw that way my arm would separate from me i wouldn't try to", "start": 44.719, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "throw it with connection right it wouldn't work very good right and so that's kind of how i look at it if i'm going to bomb it i want a little freedom in my arms to be", "start": 53.6, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "able to to swing i don't know if that makes any sense but it does me i mean i and i think you know we we have sort of our foundation pieces", "start": 62.48, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "laid out on the website and and those are sort of built to get you sort of um using your pivot right so if you want to say that would be the form", "start": 71.68, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "of connection we're talking about so your pivot transports your arms and creates puts energy into your arms", "start": 80.64, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "that's what happens and on a smaller shot yeah there's probably the upper arm and the side of your pecs kind of", "start": 88.96, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "stays in connection but as that grows as there's more energy then there's probably some disconnection there right so it's kind of a fine", "start": 96.0, "duration": 19.278}
{"chunk": "balance we want some structure and and sort of um some stability where we can still deliver the club right and there's not a lot of moving parts", "start": 106.079, "duration": 18.402}
{"chunk": "but if you're looking to create some distance and some some leverage in some of these long drive guys they're they're bringing the driver up pretty high and their arms aren't", "start": 115.36, "duration": 18.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "staying right on their chest all right so so that's kind of the you have a couple ends of the spectrum you've got", "start": 124.56, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "the people who are really connected you know they hit it pretty straight right and you got the guys who are like long drivers who get this thing you know way up in here", "start": 132.56, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "they hit it really far you know they don't hit it very straight so it's like there's some happy mediums there well those are kind of a couple variations we", "start": 140.959, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "talked about off camera you know you've seen this before you take a glove you put it under your right armpit here and basically try to keep that", "start": 149.44, "duration": 18.878999999999998}

{"chunk": "armpit here right and we've seen really good players throughout history who had that pattern like ben hogan had a little bit of that pattern in his golf swing mac oh grady", "start": 167.599, "duration": 15.999999999999998}
{"chunk": "probably had a little that pattern there's a lot of great players that had that and they've done they've done the same thing too on this arm as well but", "start": 175.68, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "you know you've also seen probably the best golfer of all time that glove would have been out pretty early in his backswing yeah jack", "start": 183.68, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "mr nicholas right yeah he had he was famous for they called it the flying right elbow and you know in reality i wouldn't call it really a flying right elbow he just let his arm", "start": 191.92, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "get disconnected and at the time that was kind of different he was he was a phenomenon and he hit it really far right and i guess in today's game", "start": 200.8, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "you could sort of talk about maybe like matthew wolf a little bit right bubba watson has a lot of that also so they're making this big wind up this big turn", "start": 210.08, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "and this trail elbow goes kind of up and it's almost like their their upper arm here is parallel to the ground or above like this right", "start": 218.879, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "so if i did one here just as an example so there's kind of a couple ways you could skin the cat i guess you could say right", "start": 228.0, "duration": 15.517}
{"chunk": "yep you know that second move can be really dynamic as long as in transition your your arm moves around i had to wait on it or at least i had to feel like i", "start": 240.239, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "had to yeah so if your arm moves like this it's not going to work very good but if you get up here and in transition your arm", "start": 248.56, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "kind of right has a little bit of that kind of a move where it right reconnects to you or gets back out in", "start": 258.4, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "front of you that's going to be really dynamic yeah so whether you're kind of more pinned and connected or you create", "start": 266.639, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "some height here and sort of distance between your elbow and your side you know eventually down in about the delivery position club parallel to", "start": 273.919, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "ground they're pretty similar right would you agree with that yeah i would agree from delivery position like we were talking about this segues perfectly to", "start": 281.52, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "the structure ball we got here from watson golf and you know you've probably seen other balls we've used before but it's a great way to sort of train you know club", "start": 289.919, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "parallel to ground or hip high to hip high and feeling a little bit of that connection the arms and the body starting to work a little more together", "start": 298.4, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "through this area so i really like the structure ball for training hip to hip", "start": 306.72, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "beyond that it becomes a little difficult and it actually is not my optimal my optimal is i actually like to have a little bit of that separation of the arms i think it's dynamic right and", "start": 313.919, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "you're a power hitter and you played baseball there aren't many guys playing baseball that that kind of no they're gonna bat here a lot of them get up here yep and then", "start": 323.039, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "you know shallow down as they rotate exactly but for those of you who really struggle with", "start": 331.759, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "your elbows moving really out of whack this can be a really good tool and we see players on the pga tour every day using something very similar to this now", "start": 339.919, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "henry hit a couple for us with that put this in real quick there we go it goes that way perfect", "start": 349.6, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "all right milo so i got this thing uh strapped into me here i got it just below the elbows and my forearms where i'm feeling pretty comfortable", "start": 357.28, "duration": 16.638}
{"chunk": "and at a point where it still allows me to like make a little hinge in my wrist so one of the issues that we see", "start": 365.759, "duration": 15.842}
{"chunk": "a lot is sort of the over folding yes of this trail elbow right it's super common players trail arm is", "start": 373.28, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "it bends too early too much right he starts getting behind them their arms start to get this kind of a a look right so this even that setup it puts my", "start": 382.16, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "arms in a position where they're basically on top of my chest too yes so you know i brought up that glove drill", "start": 391.919, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "early on or you could put it under both armpits and that sort of just that little bit of tension that set up with the upper arms getting it on top of the", "start": 399.52, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "chest versus kind of back under can be a good thing yes to have and when i do it i also i'm cognizant of the fact that my trail arm", "start": 407.52, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "isn't locked out either you want that trail arm soft all right so i have just a little bit of fold to it and i'm just i'm basically just making", "start": 417.919, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "these little half swings and you can make half swings and you can learn introduce a little bit of hinge in the wrists but you're really just trying to", "start": 427.199, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "manage that structure back and through you see i'm not i'm not overly concerned with the contact here", "start": 437.919, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "i'm just making these little swings and again using my pivot to really drive this club back to the ball", "start": 445.199, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "the arm structure is really taken care of yeah through the hitting area with this device so that's a really good way to feel", "start": 453.599, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "the connection that a lot of people talk about is i think it's a perfect way to train your basically the small parts of the golf", "start": 466.16, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "swing from hip to hip it's awesome now as we grow it and make it more dynamic that becomes something that i probably recommend you", "start": 474.479, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "stop using yeah and i i guess if we had someone that was you know getting their arm way back here and not having some width and freedom", "start": 482.08, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "where it was kind of you know what contracted back here this might be a good thing to have to kind of go the opposite way and make an", "start": 491.599, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "exaggeration where the arms feel a little more out in front of them a little wider and they're keeping things a little bit more", "start": 499.039, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
