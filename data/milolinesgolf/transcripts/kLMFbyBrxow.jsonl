{"chunk": "hi mr. Milo thanks for having us out here man welcome to nature and some of you guys know golf let --ax Milo's YouTube channel and Instagram I", "start": 122.81, "duration": 17.330000000000002}
{"chunk": "certainly other videos that I watch and we're lucky enough to have Matt here with us today and in today's video in particular we're gonna talk about three simple steps right to building a golf", "start": 131.69, "duration": 18.7}
{"chunk": "swing and so let's say that's imagine I came in and I'm I'm John down the down the street and I come in for a golf lesson and I'm looking for kind of three pieces", "start": 140.54, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "to start with to build my golf swing what would be some of the areas that you would work with someone on so number one", "start": 149.87, "duration": 16.179000000000002}
{"chunk": "face yeah get the face how we want it number two we've learned how to rotate actually first we'd get the shaft where we want it so we don't get it steep and", "start": 157.85, "duration": 15.751}
{"chunk": "then learn how to rotate those would be the three things alright so I'm gonna I'm gonna literally pause this already this quick into this club face first", "start": 166.34, "duration": 15.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "Club shaft second right swing direction and then pivot rotation mm-hmm okay maybe we've heard that or not before once or twice now before we dive into", "start": 173.26, "duration": 17.05}
{"chunk": "those two let's say when you're working with someone out here and you have kind of a little three-stage drill or process to start out with can you talk us through what you would do I'll just flip", "start": 182.42, "duration": 16.59}
{"chunk": "flop spots here sure what kind of stage 1 stage 2 stage 3 so generally every person that shows up I make them assuming I've already helped them with", "start": 190.64, "duration": 16.349}
{"chunk": "their grip and some other thing in their setup I always will have them start with a little drill where they're not they're not even using their hands at all so", "start": 198.799, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "their hands and arms are basically dead and I start them hitting little pitch shots like this so I put the ball on a tee we'll start with little swings like that", "start": 206.84, "duration": 17.128999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah yeah let me dive in and try that here so just kind of getting a foundation of how the body works getting some turn and rotation right building a foundation here so am i starting this", "start": 215.329, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "probably like shorter to mid mid iron ish generally I'll have them with like a 7 8 9 something like that got it okay cool yeah and so I'm gonna take my", "start": 224.329, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "normal set up I'll just do one or two rehearsal to get started so phase one of this or part one is I'm gonna make a little backswing here feeling all body", "start": 232.31, "duration": 17.31}
{"chunk": "no arms and hands and my low as I'm doing this is there like a certain distance I would go - yeah I want to see the club get to about parallel to the ground on both sides okay God okay so", "start": 240.29, "duration": 19.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "parallel to the ground on both sides all body no arms and hands exactly and now I'm going to I kind of clip a couple not there and", "start": 250.01, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "we're talking like if you're doing it right you're not gonna see the ball go very far 20 30 yards maybe I can most shorties so I got this teed up I got a 9-iron I've", "start": 258.81, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "got that little feel here basically the club parallel on both sides all turn no arms and handles good and do on and of", "start": 267.75, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "course so that went a little harder so you take it way farther than that's I tell people all the time like hey I'm gonna tell you I want you to hit it like 40 because I know you're gonna actually", "start": 275.49, "duration": 19.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "hit it like a hundred and so when I'm doing this drill here I mean of course there's gonna be like a little bit of arm and hand motion and voluntarily but", "start": 284.4, "duration": 16.47}
{"chunk": "the the point being to feel the point is to feel how your body turns to move the golf club yeah I got you okay so let me try that and actually do what", "start": 292.62, "duration": 15.148}
{"chunk": "you asked me to do their club parallel or more of that length here all body no arms in hands shaft parallel that was", "start": 300.569, "duration": 19.142}
{"chunk": "closer okay good so probably still double the distance but we're it's a starting point and you know I can feel right away when I'm doing that me who", "start": 310.44, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "tends to get kind of here off the bat feels very good and I like that as a foundation for someone to start with giving you don't you know know anything about their swing we're just getting", "start": 318.78, "duration": 17.559}
{"chunk": "started here and so that would be fate you know phase one or foundation number one let's talk in a minute about how we would add to that okay so let's talk", "start": 327.479, "duration": 15.899999999999999}
{"chunk": "about phase or part 2 here Milo let's say we were hitting shots and in this first stage so people know if I'm doing actually Club parallel body motions on", "start": 335.759, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "both sides is there like I'm doing a certain amount of reps or I'm doing this until you know I'm doing it for 15-20 minutes one two three sessions depends I", "start": 344.88, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "don't really have a set time frame then really it's tell you can hit it solid every time yeah show me you can do this and not hit it a hundred yards yeah yeah", "start": 353.61, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "until you get good at it yeah right and then so once we're doing this and I'm getting into here what's kind of part two here part two we're gonna now add in", "start": 363.24, "duration": 16.95}
{"chunk": "the lever system so we're gonna let you hinge your wrist a little bit gotcha you start to see a little bit of fold in the right arm okay got it so I'm doing I'm starting to swing the same way", "start": 371.94, "duration": 16.77}
{"chunk": "starting to swing exactly the same way and then about the time the shaft gets parallel now from there up to the left arm parallel you're going to add just a little hinging in got it okay okay I", "start": 380.069, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "gotcha so I'm still feel the same kind of body dominant here to get moo-ving and once I get back to club peril I'm just gonna repeat some of the", "start": 389.099, "duration": 15.211}
{"chunk": "stuff you said here once I get back to club parallel I'm feeling a little bit of hinge here until roughly left arm parallel that's the high so just really", "start": 396.15, "duration": 17.61}
{"chunk": "a a minor addition to that little first piece oh I like that body motion and then you well you'll notice is the ball is gonna go", "start": 404.07, "duration": 18.11}
{"chunk": "significantly farther yeah with the same amount of effort gotcha with adding in the without again Alaric I got it so let me see if I can actually be a good", "start": 413.63, "duration": 15.88}
{"chunk": "student here good and maybe one or two where I do like a pause like that and actually break it up yeah milah okay good so I'm gonna do one to", "start": 421.41, "duration": 15.63}
{"chunk": "go so I'll body early and then I'm adding a little bit of hinton that feels really good what I really like about this Milo is as", "start": 428.67, "duration": 18.45}
{"chunk": "I'm doing it it feels like by keeping things simple and focusing on those two pieces easy for me to grasp and it feels", "start": 437.64, "duration": 19.65}
{"chunk": "like I could really probably fix ten different things that could have went wrong by just focusing on those two elements exactly yeah and which I'm sure it's the point of why you do that that's", "start": 448.11, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "why I do it so body to here body to first parallel kind of hinging to left arm parallel body motion on the way through let's go ahead and do one more", "start": 457.5, "duration": 19.05}
{"chunk": "of those kind of phase two here yeah that feels really good for me so that would be Phase two and I'm assuming by", "start": 465.42, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "the conversation on kind of phase one they're kind of staying here until they're getting good at this yes past second grade before third grade exactly so guys that would be phase two", "start": 475.92, "duration": 17.79}
{"chunk": "let's talk a little bit here about phase three all right Milo so phase two continuing the idea of the body getting things moving adding a little bit of a", "start": 485.22, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "hinge little nubber here let's say I'm efficient at that I'm getting good at that part what would be the next phase the next phase is to add in just a little more turn in the backswing and a", "start": 493.65, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "little more in the follow-through so we're just growing the swing to basically a full golf swing lever so all body to here feeling kind of no arms and", "start": 502.86, "duration": 17.130000000000003}
{"chunk": "hands adding a little bit of hinging now just this time as I'm doing it if I'm painting I'm just going to continue to turn let the arms and hands go a little just gonna add a little more turn yep", "start": 510.81, "duration": 15.03}
{"chunk": "and a little bit of more turn on this side exactly I can even feel already someone who likes to get arms and in the swing I would need to live at", "start": 518.91, "duration": 19.73}
{"chunk": "this first phase for a little just to kind of get the sensations of recruiting my body yep generally in a lesson we might spend the first half an hour just doing that yeah", "start": 528.34, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "not two swings but it's I call it foundation building if you don't have the foundation there's no point in going vertical with the", "start": 537.94, "duration": 15.55}
{"chunk": "building yeah exactly I love that so let me let me try kind of put doing skipping ahead here so kind of phase one phase two and just kind of adding a little bit", "start": 545.59, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "more turn on both sides and put that together yeah it feels good feels like my body's moving you know where's a lot", "start": 553.84, "duration": 18.33}
{"chunk": "of times I don't I don't get that sensation that was pretty good yeah it feels good well what I really like about", "start": 563.32, "duration": 18.39}
{"chunk": "it feels good I know I said this already is like the simplicity of it of how little I have to think about but at the same time understanding how many things", "start": 572.41, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "you're really fixing by keeping it that simple and so I love that I don't know we need to add much to that I think that's a really simple way for people to", "start": 581.17, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "get started kind of regardless of where they're at yeah you know almost every lesson I start with even with professionals we start there goddess you", "start": 589.06, "duration": 16.29}
{"chunk": "guys here you heard of here first mr. Milo's three steps here to building a repeatable golf swing love this start short and slow as Milo said don't hit a", "start": 597.82, "duration": 16.77}
