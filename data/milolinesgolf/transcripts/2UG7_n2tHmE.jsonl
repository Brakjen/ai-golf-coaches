{"chunk": "so let's talk about how to get that low left exit that we see from the pros well Ed", "start": 0.06, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "this is an interesting topic something that I have thought about quite a bit and when I was learning how to play I Remember watching some of the", "start": 8.16, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "the guys on on tour especially some guys like Hunter Mahan you remember Hunter Mahan Hunter had a really cool golf swing and", "start": 17.52, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "his Club exited so low and left that it was almost boggled my mind and then when I when I looked at like some of the old", "start": 25.92, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "time greats like Ben Hogan and others their clubs also had that really low left exit and I always strive to", "start": 34.559, "duration": 22.921}
{"chunk": "have it but in my own personal golf swing I can't quite match what they do and there's a few reasons for it my swing's a little different than a guy", "start": 46.02, "duration": 18.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "like Ben Hogan's it's more vertical more vertical yeah so do we always want that really low left exit you know what", "start": 55.02, "duration": 19.1}
{"chunk": "unless you're trying to hit a specific shot you want your golf swing to be as symmetrical as possible yes if you have", "start": 64.4, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "a very vertical lead arm chances are you're gonna have a hard time doing a very low exit to the left assuming you're not trying to hit a", "start": 73.86, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "specific shot I can make it do it but the problem I have from my backswing where my hands are way more high is if I", "start": 81.78, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "make that club exit low and left like I see Hunter Mahan and Ben Hogan doing I hit a slice because it's not symmetrical it's not", "start": 89.88, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "symmetrical yeah because it doesn't match my Symmetry and if you have if you're someone like me who has you know a lower lead arm it's a lot easier for", "start": 97.86, "duration": 18.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "me to Exit over here versus me to Exit with my hands super high because then that would cause a big floaty hook yeah", "start": 106.92, "duration": 15.779}
{"chunk": "so I think a lot of your exit is predetermined by the arm plane in the backswing yes so if you're a more upright swinger like a Jack Nicholas", "start": 114.299, "duration": 18.301}
{"chunk": "versus a Ben Hogan Ben Hogan was very very flat Jack Nicklaus was more vertical the x is going to be a little bit more vertical if you want to hit it", "start": 123.42, "duration": 17.459999999999997}
{"chunk": "straight yeah so or you're not pivoting through the exit you're pulling your hands across the exit yes so we see a lot of those", "start": 132.12, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "players right who take the club significantly in go over and yeah they're low left but they've compromised the entire pivot their symmetry is", "start": 141.36, "duration": 17.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "completely off they've taken the swing circle from being up and in down and out here to up and in over the top and way left that's", "start": 150.36, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "what doesn't necessarily work either and what I wanted to talk about is how do we develop that symmetry the correct symmetry what dictates the path or the", "start": 158.52, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "what this club looks like and where it exits or what should dictate it there's a there's a lot of different factors that could happen if I throw in like you said some armies and hands you know that", "start": 166.58, "duration": 18.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "club's exiting down by my belt buckle 100 I'm not going to hit it any good no if I got it over there with my Pivot like this that might be pretty darn good", "start": 175.8, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "potentially depending on where it was coming from over here correct so what controls that Arc or what do we want to control that Arc well some of it is", "start": 184.92, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "physically dependent yeah like you have a unique frame especially with the length of your arms you you're gonna you're never very unlikely to have a", "start": 194.28, "duration": 21.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "lead arm that's flatish across your shoulder plane you can't even put it that hurts it hurts you physically your", "start": 204.659, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "arm is so long me I'm like a T-Rex and for me that's the only place it can go so we're built completely different so I", "start": 211.92, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "can't do what you do and you wouldn't want to do what I do yeah but so I think a lot of it is where you physically are now that doesn't mean with time and", "start": 220.56, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "training and practice that you can't bend and turn and get the spot in a more vertical even if you have shorter charms I'm not saying that but the way your", "start": 228.299, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "body naturally pivots you have to use a ground force that's matching your arm plane to create a most efficient acceleration on the club", "start": 237.72, "duration": 17.941000000000003}
{"chunk": "so for me with my arms being low-ish if I go vertical if I go horizontal hard my low point is going to be a mile back", "start": 246.12, "duration": 15.9}
{"chunk": "here so I have to jump and then I can't rotate for me with my arm plane I have to actually push this way to let that", "start": 254.64, "duration": 15.9}
{"chunk": "club kick out but you're very vertical because your arms are very vertical and so I have I also don't have a lot of linear motion in my swing like almost", "start": 262.8, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "none yeah but I have a lot of push up and back not as much like horizontal the ground torque mine is", "start": 270.78, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "more on a matching my vertical plane a little bit more so a little bit more that way which makes that Golf Club then", "start": 280.02, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "slingshot and exit a little bit more up the arc up and left up and left so it's not we don't really ever want to see this golf club going", "start": 288.72, "duration": 17.821}
{"chunk": "out to the right that would be a bad idea although we do teach those people who are so significantly other way we ask them to", "start": 298.08, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "feel that to try to zero them out some amount well yeah but it all depends on where a person's coming from but where if we're just looking at the swing we we", "start": 306.06, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "want this thing to move with symmetry so we don't ever really want we don't ever really want the club to do that though it might need to feel like that for some we really want this golf club to follow", "start": 315.12, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "a nice Arc and the thing that makes the club follow a nice Arc is a pivot that's moving in a nice Arc", "start": 324.539, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "if my Pivot was to to tilt and stop that club's going to move out of its Arc into a weird Arc the minute that you just did", "start": 331.8, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "that normally your pivot goes like this and the minute you did this this went backwards and you went up like this you couldn't stop it from happening yeah so", "start": 339.84, "duration": 18.779}
{"chunk": "it shot up so what I see from a lot of amateur players who have that kind of a tendency is all of a sudden the balls way in the back of their stance and they", "start": 349.919, "duration": 15.901}
{"chunk": "make this same motion and they figure out how to hit it somewhat okay not optimal so Edward we've got to show them a couple of different motions here I've", "start": 358.32, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "got to show them one where I I'm going to be a little bit shallower plain with a little bit more of a low left Ben Hogan it's going to be hard for me and", "start": 367.62, "duration": 18.899}
{"chunk": "then one that's more my style so here we go shallow Ben Hogan oh", "start": 376.919, "duration": 15.861}
{"chunk": "that was hard okay now me interesting when I hit it about 40 yards farther well and about 80 feet higher", "start": 384.84, "duration": 18.02}
{"chunk": "if our goal is to get this club to swing around and exit a little bit more around which for most people I say that is a good goal how do we want to do it well", "start": 418.319, "duration": 18.180999999999997}
{"chunk": "first off let's get the arm plane in a nice spot in the backswing let's just say that that's already under control we've got this nice backswing we've got the arm plane where we want it now what", "start": 427.44, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "is the key to for me to be able to get this golf club to swing around correctly most people when they start pushing off Trailside to try to get pressure forward", "start": 437.039, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "that sends their upper body back this way and they're dead so as you're loading correctly in your backswing with a reasonable backswing as you as you", "start": 446.28, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "load into your Trail hip and it sends your pressure back to the left now you can push and it'll this lead leg away", "start": 455.099, "duration": 16.22}
{"chunk": "send this on its Arc over here to its planed finish a symmetrical plane from where you started to where you're finishing awesome so the way I'm", "start": 462.139, "duration": 18.461000000000002}
{"chunk": "pivoting my body is what's actually directing my hands and the club into the arc I wanted that's what that's the answer I was trying to get at so for all", "start": 472.38, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "of you who have golf swings that tend to exit way too high what you really need to focus on", "start": 481.139, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "is getting your pivot to move correctly you might have a little bit too much late push off of your Trailside which then dumps your shoulders this way and", "start": 489.419, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "retards the pivot it doesn't allow your chest to turn basically is what we're getting at if my chest can't turn the club's got to do that so we've got to", "start": 498.599, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "make sure our chest can continue on its way around the circle and you can't pull down so if you go to the top and you immediately pull", "start": 507.96, "duration": 19.56}
{"chunk": "down this way it sends your hip forward and cinch your chest back and now you're dumped under and now you have to exit yeah so if I if I put a massive force", "start": 517.56, "duration": 16.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "with my arms like this yes that's what it will do to my body so if I swing it back like this and I throw a massive Force at it with my my arms now I'm I'm", "start": 525.54, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "trapped and I can't get my chest out of the way so my hands are going to do that and shoot up so we need to really feel the timing of the motion as I'm", "start": 535.2, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "changing directions I land while the club is still finishing this last little bit of its wind up and now I can take my", "start": 543.54, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "whole lead side and I can move it away from the golf ball and when I do that that slings the clock out and around the arc I want it on on the symmetrical Arc", "start": 551.16, "duration": 16.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "that you started and I didn't do any of it with my hands necessarily my hands job is a little different roll they control this thing yeah", "start": 560.04, "duration": 17.637999999999998}
