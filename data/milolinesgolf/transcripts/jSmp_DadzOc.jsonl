{"chunk": "[Music] hey everybody welcome back to superstition mountain milo here with henry fall and today we have a really good video", "start": 0.0, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "for you about how you hit up on your driver the correct way", "start": 7.2, "duration": 18.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "there's a lot of ways that i see people try to hit up on a driver let's walk through a couple of those henry yeah there's a there's a few uh a few", "start": 16.48, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "swings you can make trying to swing up on the driver that can lead to some really problematic issues and usually a big hook is one of them comes", "start": 23.76, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "up a lot from what i've seen so what is the what are some of the main things you see people try to do to hit up on the ball well let me throw a ball on a peg for", "start": 33.2, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "you so you can kind of demonstrate the wrong way to do it i usually see it set up um you know obviously there's a little tilt that's set up right yeah", "start": 40.559, "duration": 18.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "so they're up in the stands it is teed up i just sometimes i tend to see people get a little too tilted yeah i see a lot too tilted and then in the", "start": 49.76, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "swing they get more tilted uh-huh so now you either hit the ground or because you get all this tilt and you", "start": 59.12, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "can't rotate you have to rely on the hands and arms to sort of roll over the top of it yep okay another thing i see people try to do", "start": 66.72, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "is they try to hit up on the ball by throwing the head up yeah so they're releasing it", "start": 74.4, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "and that just produces spinny high shots that tend to go left again because you're you're you're basically creating that left face angle", "start": 82.64, "duration": 18.718}
{"chunk": "you're making the club point back around you yep right so now we've kind of covered the what not to do's walk us through", "start": 92.159, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "how you would like people to hit up on a golf ball yeah i think number one is understanding the driver itself right it's a longer", "start": 102.799, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "club so in theory the swing should be a little bit flatter a little more around us yeah versus up", "start": 110.479, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "trying to hit up right so for me i've always liked the feeling of being somewhat kind of level or swinging over an object to have that club moving", "start": 118.96, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "around me right okay so then i can just clip it off the top kind of like playing t-ball as a kid yeah so the club goes a little more", "start": 129.119, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "around the other thing i do is just based on where i put it in my stance so the ball for me is kind of right in line with my left shoulder here", "start": 136.64, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "and because of that the club tends to bottom out somewhere about right here and it's going to be moving upward", "start": 145.04, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "as it strikes the golf ball now in my golf swing as i'm going through this ball i'm turning and i'm actually pushing backward but at the", "start": 152.72, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "same time i'm not unloading these angles right they unload naturally but they haven't all the way unloaded", "start": 160.879, "duration": 15.281999999999998}
{"chunk": "when i arrive at impact so i'm hitting up but at the same time i'm not adding loft right right yeah and i mean it just one of the other", "start": 168.0, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "issues i've seen is where players that set up to this ball and they come in steep and across the line they actually go right underneath this", "start": 176.8, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "tee they hit the ground and they pop it straight up in the air uh-huh so they're trying to teed up high they have the right intention but", "start": 185.28, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "it just doesn't work out because that club gets out too far in front of them okay and since you mentioned that", "start": 192.64, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "i brought a bottle of water here oh yeah and i wanted to show everybody a really simple drill to train you how to hit up so first you", "start": 200.08, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "start with a t only and a bottle of water and you're just going to practice making some little swings and you want to clip the tee and go over", "start": 210.879, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "the bottle of water so if i do that i'm going up if you if you can't do that figure out how and it's natural you're", "start": 219.519, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "not necessarily forcing it no i'm not forcing the club up yeah it's just moving up naturally in its arc right here so i'm catching the ball", "start": 227.84, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "let's put the bottle this way just so they see that um i'll get a t for you here okay so put it about a foot behind it just so you can see on camera how you're", "start": 235.84, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "continuing to rotate the club going back around you so i clip that t perfect and the club goes back around and goes", "start": 244.239, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "over the bottle right so the bottom of the ark's happening somewhere just before the t right and you're not hitting the ground you're just sort of you're starting your", "start": 252.319, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "sort of sweeping action there and because the club is moving back around you to the left it's also going up that's why the ball positions forward", "start": 260.079, "duration": 18.322}
{"chunk": "exactly now once you can do it and just clip the top of the tee now we'll throw a ball on the tee", "start": 268.72, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "and we'll start slow and try to hit the ball without hitting the t and you can see i hit it", "start": 276.72, "duration": 15.678}
{"chunk": "that's no no problem for me my natural motion swings up a few degrees yeah now most of my students have a hard time with this drill", "start": 284.479, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "the first few swings they clobber the bottle while they have that sort of steep down across yeah and they tend to suffer from pop-ups yeah you know so once we get this kind", "start": 292.96, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "of figured out then they learn how to level out the bottom of that swing arc without tilting away from it excessively because then they have no control of the face", "start": 302.24, "duration": 15.758000000000001}
{"chunk": "right right so this is a really simple easy little drill to do to be able to learn how to hit up the right way without", "start": 310.479, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "flipping at it to add loft or tilting back excessively yep yeah just it's just more natural as to what the club should be doing or", "start": 319.84, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "or is already doing in the swing rather than manipulating to swing up on it yep so just tee it up a little higher and have it far enough forward in the stance where you can still swing", "start": 328.96, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "naturally up on plane and around yourself awesome well now that we've seen this let's see if henry and i can both hit a", "start": 338.08, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "couple shots with a little bit of upward angle we're going to use the bottle is that how we're doing it you have to do it with a bottle oh okay my version the bottle is different than", "start": 346.24, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "yours i was gonna try something else for you here let me hit one this way move it back just a little bit more and i'll let you uh", "start": 354.16, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "let you hit yours so if i'm trying to reach a par four this is probably about the height i would use yep so you're gonna this is", "start": 362.08, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "this is going for the big smasher right right and again i at setup i might have just a tiny bit more tilt but it's really ball position and in your normal drive you don't", "start": 370.56, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "actually hit up much you're pretty level right i'm pretty level i i like to see kind of a little squeeze fade that i wouldn't call it a burner but it's", "start": 379.199, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "definitely not as high as maybe like a bryson with it or rory would hit it yeah okay like to kind of have that piercing trajectory well here you're going to get a nice", "start": 387.039, "duration": 17.842000000000002}
{"chunk": "high one okay and he had no problem getting it over the bottle and hopefully he kept it on our driving range yeah i don't know you hit it over that", "start": 395.84, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "person that's walking over there okay i better aim a little more left than that so i keep it in the ring okay", "start": 407.12, "duration": 17.720999999999997}
{"chunk": "they're they're in depth zone i won't hit it real hard i'll hit a little i'll hit a little squeezer out there well it's good if you can do it slow though", "start": 422.8, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "that's a good practice too there you go yeah let me do one more here you gotta try it without the cap on this guy", "start": 430.8, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "oh you're gonna put it on top of a tall bottle and just clip it off the top so this is great uh for radius control too don't you spill my", "start": 442.0, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "water now uh i'll try not to i'm probably gonna have to hit a little you know groove low but it's a great uh practice for radius", "start": 450.72, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "control i mean if you have a really tall tee or one of the things i always do with um students that that that struggle with", "start": 459.599, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "either a slice or hitting down the driver and hitting the ground um is putting like a head cover down on the ground and say hey", "start": 467.199, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "just swing over it no ball just see if you can swing over it right kind of like the ball same idea as the bottle yeah and half the time i swear they hit the ground", "start": 476.0, "duration": 16.638}
{"chunk": "first thing or they hit the head cover so it teaches them to get that more roundabout motion feeling like sort of like that t-ball move i was", "start": 484.319, "duration": 18.642000000000003}
{"chunk": "kind of referring to so i'll try this right here hopefully the bottle doesn't blow up in my face oh i topped it", "start": 493.44, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "that was pretty clean though let's see i put the bottle right back in there for you capped it for you that was pretty good actually that was kind of cool", "start": 502.96, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "so now that we understand how we hit up on the golf ball let's talk about the effect that hitting up on the ball has on the path", "start": 511.52, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "of our swing and the face let's hear from you henry what well i mean when you start to swing more up on a driver", "start": 518.719, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "or any club for that matter the path begins to work back up around us on the arc yeah so the path becomes slightly more to the left exactly", "start": 529.76, "duration": 19.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "right so as we t a higher right in theory we're going to have it a little more forward so the path is going to be more left", "start": 539.2, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "so this is why you see a lot of guys that hit it far off a tall tee they start to get their trail foot kind of back more and more kind of like bryson you're seeing", "start": 548.72, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "yeah so that that actually counteracts the fact that they're hitting up neutralizes the path so they can still hit it fairly straight because otherwise it starts to turn into a cut", "start": 557.44, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "which is what i do i just go with it and let it cut yeah yeah and i've had to kind of work on that a little bit with use because i i've always hit that sort of", "start": 565.6, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "uh more piercing cutter off sort of a mid-height t so when i tee it up higher my tendency is to you know the path gets a little more", "start": 574.24, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "left and now because i don't flip the face over that ball actually starts a little right okay my intended line cuts even more because that face is kind", "start": 583.04, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "of passive yep and i'm i'm putting that that spin on it and it starts a little right of where i want it to so now i've worked", "start": 591.92, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "more on getting my alignment correct with that awesome so when you tee it up high and you have it forward in your stance that", "start": 599.279, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "path's going to start going more left on you so you might want to close your stance just slightly to counteract it so you can still hit your straight ball or draw if that's what you want", "start": 607.279, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "yeah if you want to fade just go with it it'll fade real easy from there yep perfect well close this out all right so if you like this video uh", "start": 614.56, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "make sure you like it hit the bell icon so you get notified when new videos are up uh subscribe and check out milolionsgolf.com", "start": 624.64, "duration": 22.880000000000003}
