{"chunk": "all right welcome back guys milo lines henry fall we're out here at superstition mountain talking today", "start": 1.12, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "about reverse pivot what is it and you know what's going on there we gotta talk about this right yeah so first off reverse pivot is", "start": 7.839, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "basically the pressure is moving into your feet the wrong direction so on the you're moving pressure kind of into your", "start": 23.439, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "front foot and then the downswing you're moving pressure into the back foot now what that looks like is generally you're going to see your upper body kind", "start": 31.279, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "of bending to the left and the lower body really not making a whole lot of turn right and when that happens you can see", "start": 40.399, "duration": 15.841999999999999}
{"chunk": "my pelvis kind of wanders out from under me to the right yeah and so that's what i would say generally it's because you didn't really", "start": 48.32, "duration": 16.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "turn so you bent left but you didn't really turn very good yeah so i i would say the biggest difference and", "start": 56.399, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "i've always been sort of a left poster we call it where you're kind of you know you can kind of turn off your right side turn center i've always kind of turned", "start": 64.32, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "more center left and as a kid i was always told i had a reverse pivot and i needed to move more into the right side in that time period who was the number", "start": 72.64, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "one player in the world tiger tiger and they were talking about getting into the trail side you know so anyways for me", "start": 82.4, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "i would get in this position right here and everyone was like dude you gotta reverse pivot you gotta fix that well it's really not because i've rotated", "start": 92.079, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "i've created extension in my spine if i was to just do sort of this left tilt that would be i would consider more", "start": 100.24, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "reverse pivot but because i turned now it matches up now i'm just posting up on my center left side and if you actually were on force plates you'd see that of course", "start": 110.079, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "don't have weight going in my trail foot yeah you'd have force going into your trail foot you might not get to the 90 to 100 like a lot of the long drive guys do but", "start": 119.2, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "you're definitely getting more there's going to be more force under your trail foot than your lead foot right so if i did it down the line here for these guys", "start": 127.6, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "you know if i just did a left side bend you know you guys can't even really see my back i mean it's still", "start": 135.44, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "facing away but if i turn now now you're starting to see my upper spine and to me that's not that's not early extension", "start": 143.2, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "i mean sorry a reverse pivot you know yeah exactly so for me the definition of reverse pivot has to do with more how the force is", "start": 151.599, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "working into the ground and it happens because of you you're tilting and not turning yeah because we get a lot of", "start": 160.72, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "students that do this where they kind of bump that right hip out their right hips going oh they go like that right and they're not they're just not making", "start": 168.64, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "that that turn part but if they got this turn to happen with that same bend yeah it would be okay so it's okay to get", "start": 178.0, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "bent as long as we get turned it's actually advisable right so maybe for for those that maybe get a little this way", "start": 186.239, "duration": 17.321}
{"chunk": "what might be a good exercise they could do well we did one with the ball the other day where we put our rear end against the ball and you practice turning and making the ball", "start": 194.56, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "roll down the wall yeah that'd be a really good exercise other good exercises would be you've seen other golf instructors with chairs put a chair up against their leg", "start": 203.28, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "yeah and practice making sure that you turn and create a little bit of window here yep that's a good one so i'm not i actually really like it when people have a little", "start": 212.4, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "pressure shift as long as they convert the pressure into rotation that's like right that's optimum that's the best right i mean one i do all the time is", "start": 221.28, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "just a simple like hug drill right and if i was to just do this well all i did was make this this alignment stick go straight up and down really", "start": 230.0, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "as opposed to to making that turn exactly so i have left side bend but it's it's also turned yep and you and i both", "start": 238.64, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "are fairly centered because i i get a lot of comments on on the channel are you stacking tilt and i'm like yeah", "start": 247.2, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "well there are some differences and a lot of similarities yeah but the real key is i'm getting the force into my trail foot", "start": 254.64, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "and i'm turning and bending to the left right and just because you have extensions upper spine and it makes more center yeah my head", "start": 264.639, "duration": 15.122000000000002}
{"chunk": "your head even goes maybe my head goes slightly left yeah it goes my head goes slightly left right and then my head it kind of goes", "start": 271.84, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "backward slightly on my down swing yep a lot of ways to do it oh cool well at least we can sort of look at it and define", "start": 279.44, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "you know kind of what a reverse pivot is as opposed to maybe those that have thought for a long time they got in this position they're like oh i'm reverse pivoting and really", "start": 286.96, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "probably aren't most likely not if you turned you probably didn't reverse pivot yep okay if you like this video", "start": 295.759, "duration": 19.041}
