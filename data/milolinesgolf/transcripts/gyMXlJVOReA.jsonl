{"chunk": "holster? Well, if you look at Sevy, he had some really soft hands and he would set the club in here with the handle pretty low. And as he swing", "start": 19.76, "duration": 19.999}
{"chunk": "the club, he would allow the the handle to almost kind of slow down the head to fly by and then it looked like when he", "start": 29.76, "duration": 16.16}
