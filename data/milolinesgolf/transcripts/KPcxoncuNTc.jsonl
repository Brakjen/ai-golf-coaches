{"chunk": "head movement in the golf swing should you keep your head down and your eyes on the ball or should you let them turn", "start": 7.6, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "[Music] so this is a response to a recent youtube question about what the head is doing in the golf", "start": 18.37, "duration": 18.03}
{"chunk": "swing now you know a lot of us have been told to keep our head down even through impact but there's also been sort of a lot of", "start": 28.16, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "people that have been saying for the past i don't know a couple decades now that you should open up your your head and let your eyes follow the ball or even turn ahead of", "start": 37.6, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "the ball and you're seeing this in some of the top players as well yeah for sure the other thing i hear is you should keep your head still", "start": 46.0, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "and if you actually put a circle around a lot of the best players in the world their heads don't stay still they move around a bit yep up down", "start": 55.039, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "back left yep the one thing you don't see is a whole lot of movement from about here on if anything their heads might back up a little bit", "start": 63.84, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "right you don't see their heads floating forward i would say that for us is probably the one big no-no with the head", "start": 72.0, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "would be you know if you're hitting a ball here is to have your head get excessively out in front of the ball yep because you look at any athletic", "start": 79.759, "duration": 15.041999999999998}
{"chunk": "motion throwing a ball playing tennis baseball their heads are always behind that object they're not getting out", "start": 87.68, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "ahead of it exactly cool so let's talk about some of the factors that dictate whether or not we should actually let our eyes", "start": 96.24, "duration": 16.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "turn or our heads turn well there's a thing called eye dominance right and are we all", "start": 103.68, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "left or right eye dominant no one or the other one or the other hopefully yeah but not everybody's the same so throughout history you can look", "start": 111.439, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "through and you can see guys like jack nicklaus tiger woods they kept their head down quite a long time right right through the golf ball we can also look", "start": 121.28, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "through and see some of the best players that come to mind like henrik stinson david duvall monica sorenstam whose eyes actually turned long before", "start": 129.92, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "they hit it so even dj we see especially with his wedges and dj with short clubs is really letting his head go yeah so", "start": 138.879, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "i've actually done some studies on this and i know that tiger woods left eye dominant jack nicklaus left eye dominant monika sorenstam right eye dominant", "start": 148.319, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "david duvall right eye dominant dj right eye dominant so eye dominance can play a role should if you're a left eye dominant player it might not make sense for you to let your", "start": 157.44, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "head turn that would be really uncomfortable and disconcerting to have to take your dominant eye off the golf ball right yeah where if you're a right", "start": 166.48, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "eye dominant player as i turn i can still see that ball out of my right eye i can't see any all i can see is my nose with my left eye but i can still see my", "start": 173.84, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "hand right here even though my head's looking over here so makes a that could make a definite difference in what would be right for", "start": 181.84, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "you oh it's really interesting and you're actually probably the first person ever told me that about their eye dominance and you know", "start": 190.319, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "we hear about it in like putting and lining things up but not really you don't really hear much about it in the golf swing and how it can play a factor in how someone's", "start": 198.48, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "head is moving in the golf swing so but let's talk a little bit about during the swing the head may be moving to the", "start": 206.799, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "uh to their trail side the med head might move up or for you even it it actually almost goes a little left in there", "start": 215.2, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "in my golf swing my first move is a little move off and then as i turn i create spine extension which actually moves my head", "start": 224.239, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "back toward my front foot in my backswing and then as i start down it stays there", "start": 232.56, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "and then backs back up so a lot of people say wow your head stays really still but when i film it my head actually", "start": 240.72, "duration": 15.038}
{"chunk": "wanders around a little bit yeah so and as do most others if you look at tiger woods from the 2000 era his head would would wander", "start": 248.239, "duration": 19.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "kind of back off the ball this way quite a lot yeah and then you had jack nicklaus who kind of had his chin start pointing to the right and jack would his eyes like this", "start": 258.16, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "so they would turn right on the plane so he's looking at the ball out of his left eye i wonder why that was but it i guess that also speaks to the", "start": 267.199, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "fact that your head is also sort of on a plane or that tilt yeah so you can see as i'm bent over here the brim of my hat is pointed on a plane and so my head can", "start": 276.4, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "turn on this plane and be okay what we really don't want to see happening is my eye is getting tilted this way", "start": 285.919, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "or this way excessively because if that happens it sends signals to my brain on which direction to swing so if my eyes are cocked like this", "start": 294.16, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "it's going to be really easy to start swinging away from the inside and if my head gets cocked this way it's going to be really easy to start swinging like that", "start": 302.639, "duration": 15.442}
{"chunk": "so it's pretty important that our eyes work on the plane that they're supposed to so if my head's going to turn i want it to turn like this and stay on the plane right", "start": 309.28, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "versus if you did that again and if your chin were to start facing or that way or if your chin was starting to face me or even come up out of it like that", "start": 318.96, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "you know a lot of things can go awry from there so i'm okay if the head turns like this i'm okay if the head works", "start": 327.44, "duration": 15.518999999999998}
{"chunk": "up and down i really don't want to see the head going a long ways forward yeah that would probably be the biggest no no in my mind and i really don't want to", "start": 334.479, "duration": 17.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "see the head getting cocked one way or the other so those are the two real forward or twisting the head off plane it could be the two no-no's but all the rest of the", "start": 344.08, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "head movement kind of natural it should be in the backswing i prefer to see the head work slightly to the right", "start": 352.8, "duration": 17.517}
{"chunk": "if it's going to move any direction i really don't want to see the head moving to the left now maybe at the very top of your backswing like mine does it moves a little right and then it", "start": 364.479, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "stabilizes and moves back a little to the left i'm cool with that because that's just my my upper spine already standing ready to do my favorite thing", "start": 373.199, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "hang out i guess for our viewers at home one thing to think about is if they are trying to keep their head", "start": 381.68, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "down or in the shot keep their eyes in the shot stay in the shot or if they're trying to rotate their head open", "start": 389.52, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "is to consider what your eye dominance dominance is before they make that change or try to implement that how do you figure out which eye is your dominant eye", "start": 397.919, "duration": 18.160999999999998}
