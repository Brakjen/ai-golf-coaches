{"chunk": "Man, that grass made these guys look silly, right? Yeah. Well, it made them look the human. Made them look human. Yes. So, when you get this into the green, you see the the", "start": 37.52, "duration": 17.599}

{"chunk": "hit those nice sort of soft nippy chips, right? Yep. Now, there's a couple methods that we're going to kind of demonstrate here. One", "start": 55.76, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "is a little bit lower method. If it's kind of a poor lie, you get that soily grainy grass into you and you just can't glide, right? You can't use the bounce", "start": 63.44, "duration": 18.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "because even the bounce digs, right? Good. Yes. So, learning to hit sort of that little lower draw shot can be good. Um, but you've also shown me a method", "start": 72.799, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "here where you can have the face a little open, maybe have the handle just a little up and learn to glide. Yep. And hit that softer one. So, why don't you show us that one if you can?", "start": 81.439, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "So, what I'm finding sometimes is that when we get in these situations where um we know the leading edge and the heel is what digs. So, what we're trying to do", "start": 90.88, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "is we're trying to address it almost as if it's a putt and add a little ner meaning a little bit up, little arching,", "start": 99.68, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "handles a little higher, and a little bit of this condition here. And the goal is is to hit it the toe on the ground,", "start": 108.159, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "per se, and the heel off the ground. And really all we're doing is pressure stays forward, a little bit of er, and we're just basically making a large putt", "start": 116.56, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "stroke, and it comes out pretty soft, and depending upon how I need it to release is how much I want to open the face. Mhm. Yeah. The one you were showing me", "start": 126.64, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "earlier, you actually had the handle maybe just slightly lower, but face more open because you knew the face being open that would also help it glide.", "start": 135.599, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "Right. So on that one there, I basically try to feel like I'm hitting a draw. And I'm basically making the hands just circle around the body and don't add", "start": 143.76, "duration": 20.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "anything to it and just turn and turn and it'll pop up nice and soft. So then you get that softer, higher one. And the bounce is what bounces through", "start": 153.28, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "this nice stuff here and it won't catch. So the big thing here is really I guess we should go back a step is really assessing your lie. Right. That was always number one when it comes", "start": 161.92, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "to any any shot that you're hitting is assess the lie first. Yeah. Right. Cuz then you need to determine the distance and so that from there you're deciding,", "start": 171.44, "duration": 15.278}
{"chunk": "okay, quality of greens, kind of ball I'm playing, conditions, yada yada yada, all those other factors and then coming up with a strategy where you want to land it, how much it's going to roll", "start": 178.959, "duration": 16.802}
{"chunk": "out, etc. Right? Because this one, like you have a variety of options. I mean, you could hit a a hybrid and roll it through the", "start": 187.84, "duration": 16.719}

{"chunk": "ball you're playing, too. So, are you playing a ball that doesn't spin much, right? Uh, are you that kind of player or are you player that you're you're playing a ball that spins more and maybe", "start": 212.48, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "you need to change your tactics? Yeah, right. Cool. Let me get in here for a second. So, you gave us a couple nice little options there. You could have the handle", "start": 221.2, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "a little higher and what that's going to do is get that huzzle out of the ground, too. So, the hoszle can dig just like the leading edge can dig. So, let's take", "start": 229.12, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "those two out of out of play, right? Um, now here, the ground isn't quite so soily and soft like you might find down in Florida. and the grass up out down", "start": 237.84, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "there even gets a little longer and grainier and it can be really it can be really tricky. So, um, so you gave us a couple options there and even playing", "start": 247.2, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "that little draw one. The other one you could do is if the lie was really bad, say it was in this little hole right here or that grass was longer and really", "start": 255.68, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "grainy into me is being able to just hit a little low draw shot and take you might need to bump it a little bit,", "start": 263.04, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "right? So, for that one, I might put it a little more out on my right toe and then still have the handle up because again, I don't want that heel to dig.", "start": 271.12, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "And I'd actually put it off the toe a little bit and even turn down the toe a little bit. So, you could hit that little lower that lower draw. And you can still get a", "start": 280.56, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "little bit of spin on it. So, you see that sort of bumping shot. And this is a lob wedge here. So, you see how low I hit that shot just to get", "start": 289.6, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "it out of that hole. And I'm still playing a little draw like you talked about. And he's determining um and and note", "start": 298.32, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "this too is we know there's always going to be some level of release assuming you're not hitting the crazy spinner. So the last thing he looks at is where he", "start": 306.08, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "wants to feel the effort for speed to land and he's already calculated how much that thing's going to release. Yeah. So I want to hitting", "start": 314.479, "duration": 19.522000000000002}
{"chunk": "um so there's a couple options there and you know I I think you you also can try different clubs, right? like we talked about. Um don't be afraid to try like a", "start": 324.24, "duration": 16.799999999999997}

{"chunk": "car just sticks and straight up in the air. Yeah. You have to carry it on the green. Right. So, you know, that's when you would employ your method of, you know,", "start": 349.44, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "maybe have the handle a little higher, open face, and feel like you hit that little draw shot. And you notice when we hit these shots, too, we're not adding a", "start": 357.759, "duration": 18.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "lot of hinge. Right now, you know, we talk about in the full swing getting our wrists into extension, our right wrist. On these shots, we don't really need much. We can actually pretty much feel", "start": 367.12, "duration": 19.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "like this club is pointed back at our, you know, our center or our left our chest here, our left pack, and just feel like we turn and turn. That's right. Yeah. We actually want to", "start": 376.4, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "maintain the loft as much as we can if we're going to add trajectory to the shot. Mhm. Or you can open the face, but then that adds enough variable and it also adds", "start": 385.52, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "spin. Mhm. Yeah. So, if the ground is firm enough too, one thing maybe you've heard of before with like Phil Mickelson and", "start": 394.72, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "others is actually allowing the club to sort of drop into the ground before the ball almost purposely chunking. I don't know if that's something you've heard of before. Absolutely. Yeah.", "start": 402.24, "duration": 18.400999999999996}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So, it now again depends on where you are. This is goes back to assess the lie 100%. Right. Cuz if it's soily and sandy, you just don't have the ability to use the", "start": 411.12, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "ground option. No. Right. But here, because the ground is just a little bit firmer, I can almost feel like I hit an inch or two behind it", "start": 420.88, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "and then just glide through. Right. So, I have that nice wide arc cuz I'm hitting that little draw and I feel like I'm just turning and turning.", "start": 429.12, "duration": 17.438}
{"chunk": "So, I you hear that sound. It was like a dunk, right? Yeah. You actually hit it about maybe an inch behind it. Yeah. Right. But because that face was open, because", "start": 438.319, "duration": 15.440000000000003}
{"chunk": "the handle was a little up, I can get away with it. Right. Right. So, this is what you see from like Jason Day and Steve Stricker and some of these guys that yeah,", "start": 445.759, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "they they got that nice sort of gliding look to their chipping action. And notice if you did that on face on, you'll see that uh Henry's maintaining", "start": 454.08, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "his width the entire time. He's not getting narrow. He's not pulling the club in. It's actually tracing where his the buttons on his shirt go. He's", "start": 462.88, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "staying wide and he's turning and turning. All right. So, a great feel for that would just be put this club in your sternum, grip the club, and just make a", "start": 472.56, "duration": 16.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "nice little pivot pivot. And you can have a narrow stance just like you would when you chip. And I'm maintaining my levels. I'm not really doing a lot of down or ups here. You know, in a full", "start": 480.56, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "swing, we have a little bit more movement, a little more flow right to left, a little more flow down and up. But here, it's just keep my level and", "start": 489.599, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
