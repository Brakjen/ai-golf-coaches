{"chunk": "beautiful Superstition Mountain. And today we want to talk about why we subscribe to a rotational golf swing. One that for us in our eyes is more", "start": 26.4, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "athletic and it tends to fall in line with what we see from the legends of old and some of the current legends in the game. Milo, before we get into that", "start": 36.0, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "first ski, I think it's important to at least lay out why we like and subscribe to this rotational pattern when some", "start": 44.32, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "coaches and some golfers out there really don't. And for us, it's there's a few reasons, and I'd like them to hear what you have to say about it. So, for", "start": 53.36, "duration": 20.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "me, as an athlete from other sports, it just tends to jive with how I move naturally as an athlete. And I've found", "start": 62.399, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "it's how athletes across the board tend to move. So, we're not fighting our own nature. That's number one. We're we're using our bodies how they're designed to", "start": 71.28, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "be used to propel an instrument. So when we look at hitters, whether it be in baseball or someone hitting a tennis ball, yeah, the way we propel the object", "start": 80.64, "duration": 20.641}
{"chunk": "is from the middle out. We don't we don't use our arm first and hope our body catches up. It's kind of the other", "start": 90.72, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "way around. We we load things, we unwind, and then the instrument gets brought along. Yeah.", "start": 99.2, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "Now, there's some other reasons that I really like a rotational golf swing is it's really safe. I find a lot of players struggle with back pain, low", "start": 107.04, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "back issues, and it's because of how their bodies are moving. Yeah. We're creating too much thrust, extension, and that pattern can really", "start": 116.72, "duration": 20.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "cause low back issues. So, when you implement the rotational swing, as we will outline for you, you'll find it's much safer for you generally. Not to", "start": 126.399, "duration": 18.002}
{"chunk": "mention, you'll hit it better that way, too. And that's what I'm getting at next, cuz I don't think this is super efficient. No, that's So when you have", "start": 136.4, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "that pattern, we're going to struggle with low point issues, right? Yeah. Also, you're going to struggle with face control issues because when you start tilting and you know that face is going", "start": 144.48, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "all over the place, you're going to have to have really good hands to be able to square that club face. Yeah. So, the benefits I find are better low point", "start": 153.68, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "control, more consistent face control, and generally it's easier to hit a start line. Well, if you really struggle with, you know, one of the big words in golf", "start": 161.12, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "is compression. Just don't compress the golf ball. Yeah. Well, if you aren't doing some of the things we're going to be showing you, it's going to be hard to", "start": 170.72, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "really compress the golf ball. So, these five keys will really help with that as well. We don't have to necessarily be so lucky to make good contact. Now, we make", "start": 179.92, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "it every time. And Milo, I mean, really, all you have to do is look back in history at the great swingers of all that. You Sam Sneed, Ben Hogan, Lee", "start": 187.519, "duration": 19.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "Trevino, some of the great rotators and obviously great ball strikers of their eras. And really what", "start": 196.84, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "we're going to outline these five keys just marries perfectly with what they do. And what what's really beautiful about their golf swings too is the flow and sequencing of them. That look that", "start": 205.36, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "they're able to create just by how they manage and power the club. And that's a a key part to this whole thing for sure. We'll also have a few different drills", "start": 214.72, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "and exercises for people to start ingraining these patterns. So, this will be a really key series for those of you looking to add rotation to your golf", "start": 223.92, "duration": 15.918999999999999}
{"chunk": "swing. We're going to outline just how to do it. All right, Milo. So, let's give them that first key. And that first key is chest rotation. This is one of", "start": 232.0, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "our favorite things to talk about. So, I'm just going to give them a little glimpse what we're gonna you guys are going to learn here in this first key.", "start": 241.28, "duration": 15.681}
{"chunk": "So, here I go. So, I'm going to Here's kind of the feeling I'm after. Okay. So, now I'm going to tie", "start": 248.84, "duration": 15.159999999999998}
{"chunk": "that into what I want to do with a golf ball here. See if I can hit a good one. I think most of us would take", "start": 256.88, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "that. This sounded good. Yeah, it was really crispy. Very nice. Okay, so what did you see me do? Well, you blended all", "start": 266.6, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "five things right there. They only need to know one. So, but we're going to give them number one. You definitely had a nice amount of chest rotation. Yes. And", "start": 274.639, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "so you you just demonstrated a nice exercise. Club across your chest and really feel how you can wind it back and", "start": 283.6, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "through beginning on kind of a level plane. You know, it's just going around us on a nice level plane like this. Yes.", "start": 292.28, "duration": 17.398}
{"chunk": "Now, one thing I want to point out is we're not really focusing on hip rotation, chest rotation. No. If", "start": 301.199, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "anything, you might actually find that your rib cage and upper body is turning almost into your pelvis a little bit.", "start": 308.479, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "Not to say that you're resisting. We don't like resisting or restricting a lot, but I'm certainly not here going", "start": 316.8, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "No, it's hula hooping or something like that with my pelvis. The motion is driven by the chest. So, the chest winds, which loads the hips, right? they", "start": 324.96, "duration": 19.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "the hips get wound up because the chest is winding against them or into them. And then vice versa in transition because of how we've loaded things.", "start": 334.8, "duration": 19.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "Sure, that the hips do go a little first, but a lot of that's just naturally how we move, but we're really driving the motion with our chest and", "start": 344.479, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "chest rotation. So, we mentioned some legends of old and if we go back and look at a Lee Trevino, for example, talk about chest rotation. horse chest was", "start": 353.039, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "like what 40 degrees open maybe at impact. I don't know. It's open. And even some of the players playing currently who hit draws. Sure. We can", "start": 362.08, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "see them hitting a draw with their chest wide open. Rory Mroy is a great example. Yeah. So, so understanding that number", "start": 371.12, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "one, it's okay to turn the chest, it's okay to rotate the chest, that it can actually be healthy and freeing. How How many of you guys feel like the golf", "start": 378.24, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "swing is unnatural at home? In reality, it just it matches up like Milo said with other sports. When you hit a baseball, your chest opens up. When you", "start": 387.52, "duration": 19.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "play tennis, your chest opens up. When you skip a rock, your chest opens up. Yeah. One of the most unnatural things you can have is trying not to let your chest open up. So, trying to hold it", "start": 397.759, "duration": 19.76}
{"chunk": "back and fire your hips. It just looks like an ouchie waiting to happen. Oh, yeah. A lot of torque on the lower back. And the other thing is like our spine is", "start": 407.039, "duration": 19.761}
{"chunk": "meant to move and rotate sort of higher up the chain in our rib cage. It's not really meant to have a ton of bend and", "start": 416.8, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "no the lower spine is meant to be our stability, not meant to be our mobility, right? So, this little exercise that you", "start": 425.52, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "guys can do, just turning kind of level here, that's going to kind of free up my rib cage and it gets me understanding", "start": 433.52, "duration": 17.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "how I can wind up and unwind my middle, right? And that that can lead me into a better golf swing and a more efficient", "start": 441.68, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "golf swing. Yep. So Henry, this time I want you to hit one more shot and I want you to really rehearse the feeling of winding the chest and unwinding the", "start": 452.16, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "chest and maybe demonstrate what it looks like at impact. Okay. And then send one out there. Yeah. I got this feeling of got ball moving. So I get", "start": 461.52, "duration": 19.278}
{"chunk": "this feeling of winding up and unwinding through. So I'm actually almost trying to feel like I get here at impact. I won't get this far. No, but that's kind", "start": 470.319, "duration": 18.322}
{"chunk": "of the sensation, right? Okay. So now if I can do that in my golf swing wind up unwind to here and that's kind of where I'm trying to get at impact that", "start": 480.0, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "beautiful open impact you guys are all after right. So I go in there feel that again chest is", "start": 489.039, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "open and I'll go hit one. Very nice that. So we'll see if my chest was in fact open at impact. So again", "start": 496.36, "duration": 20.641}
