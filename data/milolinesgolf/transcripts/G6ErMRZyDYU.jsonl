{"chunk": "so let's talk about why your ball position is restricting your pivot all right Milo this is top I wanted to bring up because I've seen ball position", "start": 0.12, "duration": 19.298000000000002}
{"chunk": "play a big part in some of the struggles we've seen with our students ball tending to be too far back that's one I would say that's the most common yeah", "start": 13.62, "duration": 18.419}
{"chunk": "all creeping back in the stance and then because the ball is really back in the stance there's some reactions that happen due to that issue right yeah so", "start": 22.56, "duration": 17.699}
{"chunk": "let's just talk about that so if I'm if I set up to this ball and then my Target's out there and I get the ball where it starts to get more on the right side of my head like this so I'm going", "start": 32.399, "duration": 18.720999999999997}
{"chunk": "to aim you I'm going to aim you at the our lesson t on the other side okay I think that's about perpendicular to the camera here okay", "start": 41.579, "duration": 16.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "so I'm lined up there and now you can see where my ball position would be so let's get this right on about 90 does that look good to you so that looks", "start": 49.5, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "about 90. I'm going to move it away so I don't hit it in the Halls if I decide I want to hit that ball okay now you can see that that ball", "start": 58.02, "duration": 15.900000000000002}
{"chunk": "position is is moved toward the back of my stance okay and I I hear this a lot when I hear when I talk to players and I ask them", "start": 65.22, "duration": 15.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "where do you play their your wedges and they tell me in the back of my stems because they think that's going to create that piercing tour light wedge", "start": 73.5, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "that they're looking at you know searching for yeah but usually what it Crea creates is either really steep or really Scoopy yeah I actually tend to", "start": 82.68, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "see people that move it that far back they actually hit it pretty darn high with a wedge it's all like yeah do a little of that action if that", "start": 90.9, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "ball is back in my stance like this and I was to make a nice turn nice pivot into the ball Henry where's that ball going to start", "start": 99.9, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "based on that uh at those houses over there on the right pretty far offline right yep so that's the first issue I'm going to have well if I hit a five or", "start": 107.88, "duration": 18.059}
{"chunk": "six of them over there in a row and I decide I'm going to keep this ball position how am I gonna get it started online right I think of it like in terms of", "start": 117.119, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "like baseball too right okay so you got a pitch coming at you and if you hit the ball that late in the strike zone I'm gonna hit somebody in my Dugout right", "start": 126.119, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "even the Home Run hitters the the ball if they're making a a hit that's more center field let's say it's out here in front of them exactly they're catching", "start": 135.12, "duration": 20.58}
{"chunk": "it basically what isn't still in front of slightly their Center yeah so I like to think of ball position too in our Center not just yeah I don't reference", "start": 145.5, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "to our feet I don't look at it based on feet all that much I look at ball position more based on my torso right because that's because", "start": 155.58, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "what can change well I could change how I my alignment like this you can change a bunch of things you could change foot flare you can change", "start": 163.62, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "your alignment with your feet you can change the width of stance yeah so that width of stance right there", "start": 172.14, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "but I'm still out in front of it right my torso that's going to make it very tough generally what that leads to is a play of starting to stall their body", "start": 179.7, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "flip the hands to get the face back on it and get the ball to start straight so they end up they were trying to hit the ball lower they end up hitting it just as high as they did before only a", "start": 187.5, "duration": 17.94}
{"chunk": "different way yeah if you're gonna have it a little back you better have a super open stance that's all I got to say yeah for sure but we do see players who do", "start": 196.86, "duration": 19.379}
{"chunk": "play it way back like Bubba Watson he appears when he's setting up he appears that the ball is way back here in his stance", "start": 206.819, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "but he's set up like you know he's going to hit it toward where we were talking about but he's set up like he's gonna hit it 50 degrees left he's Way open yeah and Zach Johnson", "start": 214.98, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "for example with his wedges he has it pretty far back but his feet are pretty far open for a wet shot too so that is a matchup you could use you could play it", "start": 224.519, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "way back but stand really open not my preference but it's it is a matchup if you want to go that way so", "start": 233.58, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "you've talked about how the ball position being back you know might make it difficult for you to rotate because you if you did rotate you'd hit it way", "start": 241.379, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "out to the right okay so let's talk about what we'd like to see where you would like to see the ball okay so generally with an iron where I like to", "start": 248.58, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "see the ball is somewhere on the left side of my buttons on my shirt so over here on my left PEC", "start": 256.979, "duration": 18.182000000000002}
{"chunk": "which tends to be kind of in line with my left ear that would be kind of my stock and you can see that that ball position", "start": 265.86, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "from the camera angle looks like it's in the front of my stance I'm sure go ahead set up again and just visually speaking because golf", "start": 273.96, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "is such a visual sport you know if this is your left eye here which is about maybe on the ball pretty close to me it's set up it always appears like you", "start": 281.94, "duration": 16.861}
{"chunk": "know maybe wedges the ball's on my left eye but it always feels like my eyes are slightly behind behind the golf ball just a little so I feel like the ball is", "start": 291.0, "duration": 15.780000000000001}
{"chunk": "right about there yeah looks like it is but I look at it more based on my chest so when I'm set up here", "start": 298.74, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "the left side of my chest is kind of on top of that stick now one of the things that you and I talk about is that if we're off we tend", "start": 307.56, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "to both hit maybe a little block or a little bit of a overdraw when we're trying to hit Fades right so the one thing we look at immediately is what", "start": 317.82, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "ball position yeah the ball starts creeping back I start pushing it to the right yeah or actually hitting draws and I don't draw the ball very much so right", "start": 326.1, "duration": 15.299}
{"chunk": "move it back forward so that's one thing that I think can pop up once in a while is and this is why little stations like this are great to practice with right", "start": 333.539, "duration": 17.218999999999998}
{"chunk": "and this is something the pros are always working on you know whether it's their grip or ball position like sort of these fundamentals we would like to call", "start": 342.539, "duration": 15.422}
{"chunk": "them right but this is this is really important because it can really dictate you know how you're going to move through the golf ball right if it's too", "start": 349.68, "duration": 15.419}
{"chunk": "far back you're going to change some things you're going to compensate for it yeah you have to and Visually like I said it's going to look different to you if I put it back here and my goal is to", "start": 357.78, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "hit it at my target out there I am definitely not going to hit it with this motion because if I do oh yeah it's super low super right", "start": 367.02, "duration": 19.56}
{"chunk": "let's see if you were aimed way over there and did that okay it would have worked so but then if I make the exact same swing and I move that ball back", "start": 377.1, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "where I want it so it's back toward the left side of my body now that same swing you hit me with a t and the ball went exactly where I wanted", "start": 384.96, "duration": 19.662}
{"chunk": "it now what might you do if we do get a little bit off and we start moving it a little too far back it would be the opposite we could maybe put a little", "start": 395.4, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "extra for just to kind of you can move it where it's almost too forward play it off your left heel like a three-wheeler driver this is actually a drill Lee", "start": 403.74, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "Westwood's done his whole career he'd actually put it up on his left big toe or maybe even slightly in front so way up there and then figure out how", "start": 411.9, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "to hit it solid and figure out yeah how to hit a ball that starts somewhat straight and cuts yeah it's a good drill all right so", "start": 419.4, "duration": 18.858999999999998}
{"chunk": "kept them on top of it a little bit now you can obviously go too far and now you create more of an over-the-top pattern", "start": 428.599, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "so you gotta be careful of that moving this dramatically that's where we I think we gotta maybe keep it in a little bit of a channel so it's not and my", "start": 436.979, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "preference is just to keep it irons basically here yeah for every iron and then I just vary my stance width a little bit if I want", "start": 445.62, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "to hit a wedge and then Woods a little farther forward there you go pretty simple all right so check out that match up for you guys at", "start": 454.38, "duration": 19.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "home because it could be stalling your rotation could be causing you to throw out some angles it might not be your actual swing it might be just something", "start": 463.5, "duration": 17.581}
{"chunk": "it's set up that we can adjust to help you achieve that more rotational move we talk about so much perfect so come on board to mylinesgolf.com you", "start": 472.56, "duration": 19.319}
