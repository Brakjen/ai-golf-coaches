{"chunk": "do it it makes the club more stable and it means that you're continuing to accelerate the golf club into the ball where once the club begins to pass your", "start": 61.039, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "hands the club is now decelerating it's it reached its maximum acceleration when that lined up and so once it's passing it's kind of decelerating and it's freewheeling it's", "start": 69.52, "duration": 18.16}

{"chunk": "one hour this lesson was four hours and by the end of the day he was hitting that same seven iron with about three quarters effort was all he could", "start": 175.04, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "he couldn't hit it at full speed and get it right but at three-quarter effort he could hit it about 150 yards and it was perfect", "start": 184.239, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "yeah yeah his ball flight started to be the same shot every time and the same window it came out about the same height", "start": 192.8, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "over and over again and it was way easy for him to hit it a lot farther first thing we did with this young man is we moved the ball", "start": 200.239, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "up in front of center of his stance so a ball or two inside of his left heel his grip was right hand was pretty under", "start": 208.08, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "like this which was causing his it was back you know two balls behind the middle", "start": 215.92, "duration": 16.479}

{"chunk": "moves in this manner the club doesn't move to the ball so you can see that i'm the club's not actually going to ever get there unless i do something with my hands to make it", "start": 292.32, "duration": 17.200000000000003}
