{"chunk": "all right milo today we're going to be talking about how to get that trail elbow in front of your seam line in the", "start": 0.08, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "downswing [Music] i'd say the first key to getting the trail elbow in front of the seam line is not letting it get behind it in the", "start": 7.44, "duration": 19.76}
{"chunk": "backswing ah so one of the things i see from players is as they take the club back they pull this arm back in this way pretty", "start": 19.279, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "early in the back swing which now my trail arm is behind my seam line and my arms folded up too much and i haven't created enough", "start": 29.039, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "elevation in my arms it's folded beyond 90. well beyond 90 and i've kind of retracted my scapula or my shoulder", "start": 38.079, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "blade too soon so now i'm already beyond where i want to be we really don't want this elbow", "start": 47.039, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "working backward in our swing at all really we want this elbow working more where it's at so this arm's going to fold this way", "start": 54.48, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "like this as i'm turning not that way it's just like if you were going to throw something sidearm probably wouldn't do it this way right it'd have some width to it this is more", "start": 63.6, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "like a shot put motion yeah push this is more like a throw or a swing we want to stay away from pushing motions and be more in", "start": 73.439, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "this the slap or the swing motion it seems like this is a really hot topic we see across youtube and just golf in general", "start": 83.439, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "is this trail elbow and how it's functioning and for a lot of you that gets stuck or it gets back behind you it can create", "start": 91.759, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "some steep motions yeah so you know i guess deservedly so it deserves talking about now ed and i actually have an upcoming video too", "start": 99.28, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "where we talk about you know it being a side on sport a rotational sport we really don't need to change the angle", "start": 107.92, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "of this bend as much as maybe people think it can be a little more constant you have a it's going to fold from you know at", "start": 117.04, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "address there's probably 10 degrees of hinge on this elbow and at the top of the swing 90 ish depending on the player maybe a", "start": 124.96, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "little more maybe a little less we want to stay around 90 though so it does fold some but we don't want it to fold too acutely this way and we", "start": 133.2, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "definitely don't want the elbow working this way at all in our backswing okay well i just think it's uh", "start": 142.48, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "it's day-to-day activities carry over i think in the golf swing you see you guys that bench preps right they're pulling in they're pushing out so you get a lot", "start": 150.64, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "of that yup and any types of exercises so we're just so accustomed to those sorts of motions more forward locomotion versus this being more of a", "start": 158.239, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "round rotary motion the arms don't need to do as much of that and the arms also are not creating the rotary motion either so", "start": 168.239, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "that's the other thing to watch out for if my right arm is going like this and creating this motion then it's going to be pulling my left arm into my chest too", "start": 176.239, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "soon so again the biggest way to keep from getting your right arm behind your seam line is to fix it in the back swing now", "start": 185.68, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "let's talk about let's say we've we've created a decent back swing we've wound this up we've got our structure good what do we want to have the right arm", "start": 193.04, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "doing in the transition well i think there's a few differing opinions on this yes so what's your preference let's go into your my preference is for it to", "start": 201.04, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "work like a hitter so a hitter and baseball would not drive their elbow out in front of them", "start": 209.68, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "their elbow is going to basically move with their pivot so it's not driving", "start": 216.959, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "or externally rotating too drastically now there might be a little bit of that so what i'm going to", "start": 226.4, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "say as my preference is once we've reached the top here i like a little supination in the forearm but notice my when i do this my elbow is", "start": 234.159, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "not driving drastically forward that's going to cause the face to open and then i'm going to have to do some other match ups with my wrists to make up for it", "start": 243.04, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "so i like the arm to stay fairly stable we build this structure our spine creates some motion and our pivot moves it's not so much so", "start": 251.68, "duration": 20.881}
{"chunk": "what we see when we see this the look of that elbow moving in my opinion is that it's more of what the spine is", "start": 261.84, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "doing than what the elbow and upper arm is doing when i do that move again with your trail wrist too when you make that move", "start": 270.8, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "i tend to see that this elbow also starts to turn in a little bit a little bit that supination anyways a little enough you kept it out and push this", "start": 279.68, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "then this elbow would want to go back that way and the wrist extension out which we see a lot of players do yes the elbow is going to move outside that seam", "start": 288.24, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "line that we have and now it's behind me so i want this to work this way and you can see that moves my elbow just a little bit and that's enough now i'm just turning", "start": 296.0, "duration": 19.838}
{"chunk": "that unit around the corner so drop your club for a sec let's make a little demonstration for them so you're going to start with your hands in front of you like a golf swing", "start": 305.759, "duration": 16.562}
{"chunk": "so if i kept my hand here on the seam line you go ahead and make your backswing so it stays in front of that right you never got this back behind", "start": 314.4, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "into my hand nope right so it's it's already in front of it what really got you up and around the corner was your wind up turn turn to the chest", "start": 322.16, "duration": 19.279}
{"chunk": "wind up the system my arms are basically in front of me and they've done this they've folded up as i've turned", "start": 331.759, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "okay so now it's in front of you so now if you apply that little move it's our it's still in front of you it's in the same position relatively yes", "start": 340.0, "duration": 16.958}
{"chunk": "now your elbow may moved a little more in front because of this move that we've done and also because see when i go into this right side bin from my thoracic", "start": 349.039, "duration": 20.482}
{"chunk": "spine when my thoracic spine bends see how that moves my elbows i'm not actually moving my elbows i'm moving my spine", "start": 358.0, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "so there's a lot of optical illusions in a golf swing that driving of the elbows forward is more of an optical illusion than it is", "start": 367.36, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "something that's actually happening and i think you and i would agree the issue we find with people trying to drive the elbow", "start": 375.759, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "is that it becomes a face opener and the hands get driven as well you get a face opener now you've got to make up for it with some crazy", "start": 384.479, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "yeah or flip so this is why we talked about with this door knob feel which i'll link below and maybe you've already seen the video but", "start": 393.68, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "with this trail wrist and this trail forearm supination when we do it the face isn't opening up i'm not laying my hand up to the sky i'm", "start": 401.919, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "still keeping that face more or less square to that arc as we come down for sure and we don't want to make the face open", "start": 410.96, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "and then have to shut it late and that's what we tend to see with elbow drivers yep if you're hard external rotating that shoulder and driving the elbow", "start": 419.84, "duration": 17.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "forward yeah you're probably gonna have to do some crazy makeup at the bottom the other thing i see with that move is a little tilting action as well yeah", "start": 428.96, "duration": 18.720999999999997}
{"chunk": "it causes well that also causes early extension you get too tilted off the ball it's not my preference i", "start": 438.0, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "i prefer to keep that arm pretty quiet just let the forearm work a little bit don't drive anything and let your spine bend", "start": 446.88, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "how it naturally spins in an athletic motion so milo this was a video on the elbow but in a way we're talking about", "start": 454.8, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "the wrist and how that's working am i right yeah when i talk about how the upper arm elbow moves it's more about", "start": 462.479, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "how my wrist moves and how my torso moves yeah the arm i don't want it to be doing crazy stuff and that's why we talk", "start": 469.759, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "about feeling it sort of just wide right with the trail arm for sure let's talk about some exercises we can do one really good exercise to teach", "start": 478.8, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "yourself how to move your rift is the looper drill we have a video on this looper drill", "start": 488.0, "duration": 20.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "on youtube yes where we explain pretty in depth how the looper drill works how we're creating a loop in the club head without flopping the face open so if i", "start": 497.599, "duration": 19.122}
{"chunk": "had my club here you're making a circle with that club head notice it's staying relatively square now my face is not doing a whole lot but i'm circling and", "start": 507.52, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "you're not circling your elbow as you do it really no my elbow doesn't have to move very much got a lot of mobility in this forearm okay", "start": 516.719, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "so that's one really good drill another good one to fix your back swing would be just a simple old standby", "start": 525.76, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "hook your left hand in behind your right arm now my right arm can't pull this way and practice making backswings we build", "start": 533.44, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "a proper structure we learn how to use our wrist in transition we're good we don't have to drive the arm we don't have to do a lot", "start": 542.16, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "of crazy things we just build the structure properly and we let it let it work it reminds me of an old lesson you gave last year with a", "start": 550.32, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "mini tour player go ahead set up and you actually stood right here and sort of made a little plane for his arm to stay in front of", "start": 558.8, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "and you would have him hit some little shots and make some rehearsal swings with that for sure so that's a that's a good feel for them at home yep so i hope", "start": 567.36, "duration": 15.6}
