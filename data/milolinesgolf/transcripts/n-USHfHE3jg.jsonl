{"chunk": "hey everybody milo here along with henry and we've got a really awesome video for you today what's it on henry 10 golf swing keys", "start": 0.48, "duration": 20.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "you've been told that are actually hurting your game they are not keys so they're not essentials so these are 10 myths that", "start": 11.36, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "you probably shouldn't be trying to do necessarily maybe right but they're probably hurting you", "start": 19.359, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "if you are right so let's get into it sweet so you've got a nice list there that we compiled together today", "start": 25.039, "duration": 18.242}
{"chunk": "so number one and you hear this all the time especially at just driving ranges for some reason but it's keep your head down yes okay", "start": 36.0, "duration": 20.799}
{"chunk": "that's i this is what i tell i get a lot of lady students this is what i tell them all keep your head down is what your husband tells you when he doesn't know anything", "start": 46.399, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "about what actually happened that went wrong that's his answer for everything right you miss hit it keep your head down head down keep your eye on the ball", "start": 54.879, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "not necessarily a fundamental some players do it we discussed this in a video previously there are definitely some players who keep their head down longer than others", "start": 62.96, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "but there have been some pretty darn good ones who are looking over there when they hit that thing keep your eye on the ball can be a good one as long as you associate that the ball is moving", "start": 71.76, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "with your eyes like if you just keep your eye on the ball there well that just the same thing as keeping your head down so", "start": 80.0, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "it's okay to let it your head move and watch the ball come off the face or even have your head move ahead of it if that matches up for you", "start": 87.92, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "and the other one that kind of goes hand in hand with this one is keep your head still most professional golfers and most really good players their heads move", "start": 96.479, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "somewhat yeah they they stay relatively still but there's definitely they're not yeah they're not trying not to move", "start": 107.119, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "i would say in the backswing i like to have the feeling or my students where they have their eye sort of on the ball versus", "start": 114.479, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "turning off so much and i don't mind if their chin moves a little bit yeah because it's staying on a plane if it stays on", "start": 122.479, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "plane i just don't want their their eyes to move off plane yep because this might actually free you to be able to turn a little farther", "start": 129.599, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "right because i can only turn to there if i keep my head here so my eyes might move a little that way not necessarily a fundamental to keep your head on the", "start": 138.319, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "wall all the time yep okay let's go to number two keep your lead arm in our case right-handed players", "start": 147.84, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "left left arm straight straight yeah so that's not true that's not true you see it with lee westwood", "start": 154.64, "duration": 15.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "jordan spieth be westwood's impacts like this where his left his left arm has quite a bit of bend in it yeah i was just looking at", "start": 163.2, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "a few gears from different professionals and it's pretty common to have the exact same amount of bend in the left and the right arm at impact which is around 20 degrees so your arms look like this", "start": 171.76, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "but not just impact and fall through how about john daly at the top of his swing yeah my back swing my left arm is bent drastically at the top of my backswing so a lot of these", "start": 181.599, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "a lot of you at home are trying to keep the left arm straight which is creating a lot of tension and taking distance and speed out of your swing", "start": 190.4, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "tension's a killer so the left arm does stay relatively straight and the reason it does is that the left arm left hand is higher up the golf club", "start": 198.159, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "than the right so when my right wrist hinges that moves this end of the club farther away which straightens my arm out but my arm is", "start": 207.92, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "very loose there's no tension in it so it definitely straightens some amount but it's not pushed straight", "start": 215.76, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "and locked out right that's death yep okay okay number three have the v's", "start": 222.64, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "line up for good grip so make the v's both points the same way he is between our thumb and our pointer finger right", "start": 231.28, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
{"chunk": "on both hands so that's a could be true could be not true right some players have them pretty close to lined up i would say most players probably", "start": 238.319, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "actually have their left hand stronger than their right yeah so their left hand this v might actually be pointing over here somewhere and their right hand v might be pointing", "start": 248.0, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "up toward their right shoulder so they don't have to match not necessarily yep okay we don't need to go very far on", "start": 256.4, "duration": 15.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "that one cool uh keep your lead foot in our case our left foot planted in the", "start": 264.88, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "golf swing well i was doing a little study on this and looking at the all-time greats there's really only one of them who kept", "start": 271.52, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "their left foot planted when you say left foot like we're talking like left heel left heel on the ground yeah so only really one of the all-time", "start": 281.68, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "greats kept their left heel on the ground he happens to be really great and he was really great fairly recently tiger but if you go back", "start": 289.44, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "through all the next 20. so jack is still ahead of him on on majors but everybody else who's on that list", "start": 296.96, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "with lots of wins that front that left heel is coming up yep all of them so it's not necessary if all the the best ones ever", "start": 305.44, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "didn't keep it down i would say it's not a fundamental well and then when you look at the follow through and finish especially modern day players their left foot", "start": 314.639, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "doesn't stay planted there either they're like you see some of these guys like jordan spieth where his left foot is like this after impact well yeah and the guys who are smartest their feet might even both be", "start": 324.0, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "in the air you know the guys who are smashing it they're jumping up in the air bubba oh yeah justin thomas yep all right let's go to the next one", "start": 333.28, "duration": 21.519}
{"chunk": "keep your knees flexed so this locks you up makes it so you can't turn in the backswing so if you try to maintain the same amount of flex all the way back", "start": 342.72, "duration": 20.238}
{"chunk": "your hips can't turn very far so what we see from the greatest players ever this the trail leg in the backswing is", "start": 357.039, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "losing some flex the lead leg's gaining some yeah and then in the downswing they gain the flex back and in the fall through the lead", "start": 367.36, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "leg loses some flex and the trail they gain some it's symmetrical now as always there are some exceptions there's usually at least some", "start": 374.96, "duration": 21.521}
{"chunk": "um extending of this right leg but you look at like kepka or anthony kim back in the day they were you know they kind of kept the knee", "start": 385.12, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "flexed but yeah that's they're from a little different era too though that's they're from the era where we were teaching restrict restrict restrict right we're", "start": 393.28, "duration": 16.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "trying not to let our hips turn and to turn our body as hard as we could right we've actually discovered that that's probably not optimal", "start": 401.44, "duration": 15.678}
{"chunk": "we probably should stop that but they learn how to play that way you're probably not going to want to change them yeah they might gradually change over", "start": 408.479, "duration": 16.322000000000003}
{"chunk": "time as they age but yeah they won't probably ever see anthony kim but so a little flex that set up and then as in the back", "start": 417.44, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "swing the left leg increases flex a little bit and right one right leg increases so yeah and then and then the opposite on the", "start": 426.08, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "other side gain flex and then decrease flex increase flex there's plenty of other videos on that we've got that all sealed up for you guys", "start": 432.56, "duration": 19.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "um number one are we on six push off your trail side", "start": 441.84, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "gotta get that weight shift the weight transfer right now i will say there may be a a push off", "start": 450.4, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "the trail side but it doesn't happen when people think it does it happens much later very late yes and i would say", "start": 458.24, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "it's more of a reaction to the front side turning around so like a hitter in baseball when they plant this front side and they start pressure shooting back", "start": 468.08, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "they're pushing this back this way and it actually this hip goes around so much that it actually pulls this hip forward and so your back leg has to push a little bit to", "start": 476.24, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "so you don't look like this yeah anything it might just be your big toe pushing up onto the top that's it yeah so you're not really pushing off of", "start": 484.56, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "your back side at least not early because if you do you're out here like this and you got you got problems so again i we've talked", "start": 493.599, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "about this before is like a good feeling at home is you come off your left heel oh don't keep your left foot planted right", "start": 501.599, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "and then plant the left heel that's kind of that dropping into the left side or center re-centering that's kind of the feeling versus", "start": 509.199, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "pushing off the right side exactly so number seven roll arms over to release the club head oh yeah", "start": 516.719, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "that's a that's a common one make sure you square that face up got to make sure we roll this so we get it squared up enough right because you keep hitting it over there to the right", "start": 529.2, "duration": 17.118}
{"chunk": "so you better roll it more now it works for some players we've seen it throughout history it's a match up but where is it coming", "start": 538.399, "duration": 15.442}
{"chunk": "from yeah it's it's a match up that if there wasn't if there was sub-optimal things happening earlier like the shaft is", "start": 546.64, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "coming down more steep face more open and you're good you're going to figure out how to get that on the ball square you know phil mickelson comes to", "start": 553.76, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "mind vijay singh pj singh you know they're really good at playing the game is it the optimal way to do it but maybe", "start": 562.32, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "for them but i would i would say that watch what's happening in modern game you're seeing a lot less players with that pattern", "start": 573.44, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "yep face more stable faces a lot of closure is something you hear a lot of yeah so now the face is working more square to the arc", "start": 581.2, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "square to the arc wrist working this wrist working more this way not nearly as much twist in them yep more like a baseball", "start": 590.08, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "swing you know you don't see baseball players rolling that over sure it might roll over but it happens over here right", "start": 599.12, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah so all right number eight uh hit down on the ball that's a great one it happens when the", "start": 607.04, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "ball's on the ground well i should say the first word you hear in that sentence is hit yes so", "start": 617.44, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "that causes people to make this kind of emotion to try to get the club down onto the golf ball now in reality is the club approaching the", "start": 626.56, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "ball down when the ball's on the ground yes the hands are actually going up though so they're they're getting to a point", "start": 635.92, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "later in the arc so the hands are working up and the club is starting to work down creating kind of a little flat spot down there at the bottom yeah", "start": 644.56, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "to me it's kind of a bad word trying to hit down on it sure you're catching it in the downswing but really what you're making is you're making the club head go in a", "start": 652.72, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "circle and the apex of the circle is happening just after you hit the ball right you're not trying to hit down oh okay", "start": 661.519, "duration": 22.881}
{"chunk": "easy enough right yeah uh number nine swing easy and grip it softly", "start": 671.92, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "yeah so i like the feeling of low tension in my grip and in my wrists and arms", "start": 680.56, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "but in reality if you measured the pressure that's in most really good players grip well especially at full speed at full speed they're gripping it fairly tightly", "start": 689.519, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "but with supple wrists and arms right yeah i would say if anything the tension is maybe just in the fingers", "start": 697.76, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "a little bit yeah so you and they've done some studies on this most really good players have very strong grip strength well this is why you hear like lydia coates been", "start": 705.92, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "doing like rock climbing and some of these players are doing rocks so they build up some of them get some strength in their hands because the stronger your hands are the", "start": 714.48, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "what feels like very low grip strength to you is very secure yeah so now swing easy when it's breezy", "start": 721.68, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "maybe to keep the spin off the ball but how many people do you know who are really high level players who don't hit it very hard well and the thing is too the easier is you", "start": 732.56, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "swing and i you talked about this in a lesson the other day i watched you give on short game it's great because it allows you to kind of", "start": 741.44, "duration": 15.037999999999998}
{"chunk": "use some of the bounce you can let the club head release a little bit sooner but when you swing really easy a lot of times that club starts getting past you", "start": 748.959, "duration": 15.202}
{"chunk": "yep so if anything sometimes keeping the speed up and rotating through the shot that keeps the face stable and you know you strike it a little bit", "start": 756.24, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "better so and most really good players are hitting pretty darn hard i know when i'm out playing with driver i'm generally hitting it you", "start": 764.88, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "know not as hard as i can but not that far from it yeah i hit it straighter when i hit it hard and i would say most professionals", "start": 774.959, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "if you give them a choice they're going to hit the shorter club and they're going to hit it hard when they're nervous they're not going to try to hit it soft feather it in there yeah i mean we we", "start": 783.12, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "talk a lot about building up or laddering like that's that's kind of different where you're starting to work on something but once you've kind of you know fine-tuned", "start": 792.079, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "it speed it up and test it out because a lot of times when you speed things up you can actually take some of the doubt out as well oh yeah", "start": 800.639, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "so but the problem most people have when they speed it up they speed up the wrong stuff so they try to hit it harder with this so maybe it down", "start": 808.16, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "and maybe they are so maybe they are better off trying to hit it easy but as you learn how to swing better swinging", "start": 815.519, "duration": 15.679999999999998}
{"chunk": "swinging faster actually creates more stability and you hit it straighter yeah all right bend from hips and keep back straight", "start": 823.279, "duration": 21.12}
{"chunk": "for athletic posture you might even hear like stick your butt out like this the old club down the back deal", "start": 833.68, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "yeah yeah no thanks i've also looked through all the best players in history and most of them set up kind of rounded off like this", "start": 841.6, "duration": 19.518}
{"chunk": "now we do have some anomalies these days adam scott maybe rory mcelroy are a little bit more i mean keegan bradley is pretty bent over", "start": 852.399, "duration": 17.922}
{"chunk": "but bending a little more bent over from the hips that could be biomechanically a good matchup for him yeah but i don't see keegan in there", "start": 861.12, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "like this either he's also i mean he's more he's more like that right he's round but", "start": 870.72, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "he's pretty bent over yeah but generally we want a little flexion in the thoracic spine we want to have that nice", "start": 879.04, "duration": 15.197999999999999}
{"chunk": "relaxed posture we don't want to have that rigid flat back pelvis tilted down too much", "start": 886.639, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "posture if you want to early extend that's a perfect recipe for it yup okay is that all of them there's probably a hundred more but we", "start": 894.079, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "we did ten so i think we'll stick with that for now um but yeah i mean i i think that", "start": 903.199, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "look everyone is has these ideas and these have been sort of said through hundreds of years of golf like keep your head down that one always", "start": 911.36, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "comes up and oh yeah you know oftentimes it can lead to some issues for us in the golf swing some of them could potentially help but", "start": 920.72, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "more often than not i would say yeah more often enough those are not the right things to to be putting in somebody's head no so anyways if you guys like this video", "start": 928.8, "duration": 17.84}
