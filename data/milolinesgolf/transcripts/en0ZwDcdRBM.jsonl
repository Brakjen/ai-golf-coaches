{"chunk": "hey everybody welcome back out to superstition mountain milo here along with henry and today we're talking about", "start": 0.24, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "how different sports relate to golf and i've got in my hand my own bowling ball so", "start": 7.52, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "let's talk a little bit about bowling and golf you both i do i'm okay 300 no i've never bought 300 before", "start": 16.24, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "300. [Music] i hammered the camera that's funny okay henry", "start": 28.84, "duration": 19.539}
{"chunk": "can you see any similarities between rolling this ball at a bunch of pins down there and golf", "start": 44.239, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "maybe like visually but i know you got something up your sleeve so well there are a few similarities i would let's start with note the first similarity", "start": 52.239, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "when we roll this ball do i roll it straight or do i spin it and make the ball curve i guess you could do one of either but the pros really spin it", "start": 61.44, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "they usually will curve their strike ball so the first ball they'll curve and then when they're trying to pick up spares right they're going to roll the ball a little straighter so usually they", "start": 69.36, "duration": 16.318}
{"chunk": "have two bowling balls they have one that's a fingertip ball that's made to be hooked in there and the other one that's a little bit straighter ball", "start": 78.159, "duration": 17.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "okay so that's one thing and the way you make the ball spin is with your hands and wrists kind of sounds like golf we use our hands", "start": 86.08, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "wrists forearms to make that ball curve out there but the real thing i wanted to talk about is", "start": 94.56, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "staying out of your own way so if i was going to roll a bowling ball down range here first thing you you usually see bowlers kind of lower", "start": 102.72, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "one side of their body and kind of one side of their body out of the way now the reason for that is they want to be able to swing this ball", "start": 110.96, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "in a relatively straight line like this without taking out their kneecaps without hammering themselves in the knee so if i", "start": 118.56, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "don't kind of myself out of the way i get hit yeah so that's the first thing so now as they walk you can see how i'm", "start": 125.439, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "kind of i'm kind of tilted off this way and out of the way so i can roll that ball", "start": 134.48, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "so does that seem very similar to golf i mean what you said about sort of maintaining space or creating space so", "start": 146.4, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "the ball can travel the same as sort of the hands and the club yeah so in a golf swing i'm set up like this and i want to make sure that i can", "start": 155.12, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "swing and get my hands and arms to move through that space right so if my body goes like this right i'm in my space and i'm going to have to make some kind of a", "start": 163.68, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "correction to hit the ball right same thing would happen with bowling if i was in the space i'd have to make my arm swing in a different arc right", "start": 172.8, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "it'd be pretty hard to roll that ball down the intended line right so there are some similarities you have to get out of your own way", "start": 181.519, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "so good golfers are they stay out of their own way so that they can pass their the club and their arms", "start": 189.68, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "through the intended window yep cool so there are some similarities here in bowling it wouldn't seem like a sport that would be very similar but", "start": 196.8, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "somewhat not really i was going to say maybe like the little uh over the triangles or diamonds you aim at beginning of the i don't bowl much but you kind of that's", "start": 205.76, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "your sort of intermediate target right so intermediate target that would apply to golf that applies the bowling lane is like a fairway you know", "start": 215.519, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "part of the reason that players throw hooks in there it's easier to throw a ball that curves and hit the spot that they're trying to", "start": 224.159, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "hit than it is to throw it straight oh so they have like a shot pattern yeah so they actually play a shot like a stock shot yeah so they play generally a", "start": 232.159, "duration": 18.242}
{"chunk": "hook yeah with their with their bowling ball just like most golfers have a preferred pattern right yep they", "start": 242.0, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "either draw it or fade it you don't hear people say no i play it straight i hear that but generally when somebody tells me oh yeah i hit it straight that means they shoot 90s", "start": 250.08, "duration": 18.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "yeah because players who are really good they tend to move it one way or the other slightly you know it might not move a lot but it moves", "start": 258.32, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "so i guess the sort of visual component and the sort of like confidence component what shot shape you're seeing that's a big part of golf as well so", "start": 266.32, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "like you can always and i guess with any sport we can say that so for sure so definitely there's some similarities okay so if you guys like this video make", "start": 276.24, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "sure you subscribe hit the bell icon so you get notified when a new video is up and check out milolionsgolf.com we'll see you next", "start": 285.52, "duration": 16.477999999999998}
