{"chunk": "hey everybody i just got off the golf course filming some really cool content for my new subscription website with this video on bunker play", "start": 0.16, "duration": 16.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "i really thought i needed to get out soon i wanted you all to see how the pros are doing this so i hope you really enjoy this video if you do", "start": 8.48, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "please like and subscribe to this channel and look for updates on milolionsgolf.com so i'm out here today with", "start": 16.56, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "dana finkelstein and henry fall both of them are pretty good dane is an lpga tour player henry is another professional like", "start": 25.199, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "myself and a college coach right yep sweet and today we're talking short game we've already done a little chipping and pitching", "start": 33.52, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "we're in the bunker now and we're going to talk a little bit about how henry does things then i'll chime in and dana can chime in we'll just talk about", "start": 41.76, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "how we go about hitting bunker shots so henry here we've got a pretty routine this is a normal bunker shot you're kind of up in the front of the bunker", "start": 50.0, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "slightly on the the up slope how do you go about this what what's your process yeah so first thing for me is assessing a lie coming into the into the", "start": 58.0, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "sand trap and kind of feeling it out with my feet i do like to dig my feet in a fair amount with these green side bunker shots okay", "start": 67.04, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "gets my uh my low point a little bit underneath the ball okay um because we want to strike sand here we don't want to strike ball first um so yeah it gets me a little bit", "start": 75.36, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "beneath the sand so for me i'm feeling it's a little bit softer assessing the lie all right i'm going to open this face up", "start": 84.479, "duration": 16.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "and as i'm digging in my handle is pretty low you're going to notice that as well okay now what would you do what would you do if you start digging in and you feel that you're on firm sand", "start": 92.64, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "yeah if it's a little bit firm i'll probably get my weight even a little bit more to the lead side okay i might not open the face quite as much because", "start": 101.36, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "now i'm effectively going to bounce it right off the sand i need to dig a little bit more in that case yeah so you've got to create a little bit more of a digging action so you're going to get left", "start": 109.2, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "okay cool but you know this one being it's a little bit of an upslope a little softer i'm going to get my weight pretty level maybe a little left", "start": 117.92, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "dig in face open handle down and i'm just gonna you know come in underneath the ball okay let's see let's see you hit one", "start": 127.04, "duration": 15.761000000000001}
{"chunk": "a little hot well yeah spinny yeah it landed soft over there a little long not bad high yeah it was real high and a lot of", "start": 140.4, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "spin so you you generally fly your bunker shots to your target or do you fly them and let them you let them chase a little bit yeah that one was clearly a little bit too", "start": 149.2, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "much but i'd probably like this shot here maybe land it 10 feet short or so and a couple hops and you know for this shot it's going to", "start": 158.48, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "spin a little bit more i mean i could make it run out a little bit but if you wanted to make it run how would you do it if i wanted to make it run i", "start": 167.28, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "might have the face maybe not quite as much open and just take a little bit more sand i like that ah perfect so that one that", "start": 175.2, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "could simplify it for you that was pretty good right there i think that's the one you should use okay see milo's coaching me right now i'll do", "start": 186.48, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "that one again i'm just tricking into hitting the right shot there you go that's the one you should hit you have all that green to work with", "start": 196.8, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "play with it don't don't fly it over there sweet so yeah but getting in here handle the", "start": 207.36, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "low if it was a little closer to us then i would go back to that other method face pretty open i'm not going to aim way left", "start": 216.799, "duration": 17.442}
{"chunk": "because i really don't need to i don't want to cut across it too much why not well for me like the idea of the the hosel coming into the ball", "start": 226.4, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "way before the toe like that's one a little sketchy and you know that that swipey motion it's just", "start": 234.799, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "your paths getting more left it's just uh you have to be super precise with your entry point if you do that right right so if anything like if i had to", "start": 242.799, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "like just barely get it over this ridge right here and the pin was really close to me i might have a little more of a closed stance and get even lower", "start": 250.959, "duration": 20.48}
{"chunk": "so that face is pointing back behind me and then come in you know still pretty square on or even a little into out", "start": 259.519, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "to create that uh see how quickly that went up in here that was pretty soft um i just think when you cut across the", "start": 269.12, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "the margin for error now it's just it's really tough to judge that you see how high and soft that is yeah", "start": 278.56, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "that i agree with so i don't i don't really like the a bunker shot with a lot of cut to me i rather hit my bunker shots with", "start": 288.0, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "almost what feels like a draw action draw release and tigers talked about that a lot recently and um you know because if you were in here", "start": 296.16, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "to kind of toss a ball you know out of the bunker it'd be kind of like that like your hand would be moving this way it wouldn't be cutting across it exactly", "start": 303.759, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "cool dana how do you do it let's hear a little bit of your your idea right here let's let the pro do her job", "start": 312.4, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "watch out for my feet marks you might yeah you might fall in holy cow so how do you hit like if you're hitting a regular bunker", "start": 320.4, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "shot how do you go about it you you hit it kind of like henry do you set up with and hit little draws or what do you do yeah a little draw a regular bunker shot i'm gonna sit up", "start": 328.56, "duration": 20.158}
{"chunk": "pretty neutral dig into the sand a little bit club face open handle low ball position", "start": 338.479, "duration": 22.081}
{"chunk": "pretty not crazy far but forward wait a little forward and then just kind of feel like you're getting a draw out towards the pin", "start": 349.199, "duration": 17.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "beautiful and even kind yeah it even almost has a little draw in the air yeah so why do you like to hit that little draw shot you know for", "start": 362.639, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "my whole life in the golf world which is about 20 years now most of what i heard is you line up feet left", "start": 371.759, "duration": 15.681}
{"chunk": "cut across the golf ball with open face yeah i was originally taught that way also um i think it can work like i don't like", "start": 379.28, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "there's obviously been successful bunker players that do it i just don't think that's consistent it's hard to control the low point and the way the", "start": 389.36, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "the club is coming into a sand you kind of bring in that escort a little bit sometimes you you know pull down on a little bit", "start": 398.0, "duration": 16.078000000000003}
{"chunk": "i just think it's a lot safer and more consistent when you're just kind of hitting a draw feel with it um and i'm pretty sure you get more spin when you", "start": 406.479, "duration": 17.442}
{"chunk": "draw off a wedge versus cutting it so those are all positives i agree one more yeah let's see one more", "start": 415.12, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "beautiful so milo if i could add one thing here that um your viewers can watch with point out that dana was doing and", "start": 434.96, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "actually if you don't mind doing is setting up the club behind the ball and putting a little indentation in the sand", "start": 444.4, "duration": 15.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "so one thing that sevi used to do is he actually put that hosel down in the sand when he was playing practice rounds or", "start": 450.96, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "when he practiced at home that got him feeling that the the hosel here was going low underneath the ball versus kind of standing up and", "start": 460.4, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "yeah getting close to that s word that dana's so he's trying to return the hosel back into the sand right the handle stayed nice and handles down and you notice that dana", "start": 468.879, "duration": 19.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "does that too when she's practicing so for our viewers at home like you know if you're out playing in a and it's not a tournament you're not playing for a five dollar nassau like", "start": 478.4, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "drop that club an inch behind the sand make a nice little indentation and return the club to it yeah when i'm when i'm practicing hitting bunker shots i'll step in here", "start": 487.68, "duration": 15.438}
{"chunk": "and i'll just set the club like that and now my goal is i just want to whack that sand somewhere between that line i just made on the ground and the", "start": 495.759, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "ball right perfect cool so the trend we see with almost all pros these days is", "start": 503.919, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "you see less of them playing their bunker shots like this right yeah i don't see or hear many of them talk about hitting a bunker shot out of a really open stance that", "start": 510.879, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "with this cutter crop cross motion and the reason i think that they've gone away from it is it's too finicky if i get a little bit steep and", "start": 519.68, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "enter the sand i can go right under that ball and fluff it and you see that where when you're making more of that draw type pattern", "start": 528.08, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "it's pretty hard to hit a really bad miss hit right a little more shallow and it's more shallow you compress the sand better", "start": 536.16, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "so that you push the sand out a little bit more towards your target instead of having it go over there and putting sidespin on the ball and even the guys on", "start": 544.16, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "and the women on tv that do open up their stance you can if you watch the path of their club it's still out towards the target it's not really cutting across as much", "start": 552.56, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "as it used to you know you don't see them cutting that way much they might open their stance well but their path is still more out towards the target but i see more players playing their", "start": 561.68, "duration": 16.398000000000003}
{"chunk": "bunker shots out of a stance that looks kind of like this right foot kind of dropped back and the handle really low that's kind of the", "start": 569.839, "duration": 16.802}
{"chunk": "way that i like to play them as well and if you've had a bunker lesson with me that's probably what you'll find so we call that saucy that wasn't bad", "start": 577.2, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "right pretty good so when you close your stance you drop that right foot back doesn't that make the face point way right", "start": 590.399, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "not if i lower the handle so tell us more about that if you lower the handle was that effectively doing to the face so", "start": 598.72, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "effectively the way that the loft works on the face if i start dropping the handle now you can see that loft is aimed back here behind me", "start": 606.88, "duration": 17.118}
{"chunk": "so by closing myself up and opening the stance i'm basically creating a face that's pointing straight up instead of", "start": 615.519, "duration": 16.882}
{"chunk": "if i kept the handle high and open the face up now the face is aimed at you which would mean i need to cut across it", "start": 624.0, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "but if the handle if i open the face and i drop the handle about the same amount i'm opening the face i can keep the loft aimed at the target", "start": 631.68, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "so you're almost saying like your your lower body is pointed way out to the right maybe 30 yards right of this flag yeah they're saying that the face and", "start": 640.16, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "the path is going to still be out towards the target a lot of these shots i feel like i'm hitting the ball over my left shoulder so i feel like i i hit it and the ball", "start": 648.0, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "goes over my left shoulder it's kind of a weird sensation but that's what i feel in the bunker and you can see that ball leaves not in", "start": 656.56, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "line with where i'm aimed i'm aimed out there and that ball shot out right toward the flag like that cool well i think that covers pretty", "start": 667.68, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "much everything in the bunker i know you like this video and there's going to be many more just like it on my new subscription site milolionsgolf.com", "start": 676.16, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "come on over and join me i hope i can help you in your journey to better golf", "start": 684.32, "duration": 12.56}
