{"chunk": "increasing so you can make that move and yes you could be shallow you see that shaft and the club well behind me", "start": 143.319, "duration": 20.04}

{"chunk": "turned into the ball from there you can see that club face is some 45 de out to the right okay so now we really got to put on the brakes a little", "start": 162.4, "duration": 20.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "bit or add a lot of arm kind of covering to square up that club face so there are some great players who have had the face", "start": 174.239, "duration": 15.319999999999999}
{"chunk": "a little open coming in the downswing and are able to match it up but by and large for you guys at home who struggle with an open Club face Maybe slices with", "start": 182.68, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "driver and then maybe pulls with your irons cuz you're really trying to square that club face up like that let's learn to get the face", "start": 192.44, "duration": 18.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "a little stronger in transition which we actually find most Tor players are actually strengthening it in transition", "start": 201.28, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "and how are they doing that Milo that's the key because again we're not we don't want this dish out move which we so often see it's almost like the the left", "start": 209.84, "duration": 20.559}
{"chunk": "wrist extends even more sometimes I see the right wrist lose extension and the left wrist gain it's like that they try", "start": 219.599, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "to do it and then it opens the club face like that this whole system is being Twisted this direction yes where what we want to do is basically twist it the", "start": 228.159, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "other way so we're up here and in transition we want to feel like we're almost twisting it that direction o that's good I almost could like you", "start": 236.319, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "could almost hold that for me and that would be like a a hold for me to feel that well I'll twist this way and you twist against me there you go oh that's", "start": 245.159, "duration": 18.122}
{"chunk": "a good one that's the twist you want to feel we want to feel like we're actually applying a little bit of twist in the transition and that gets that face", "start": 253.76, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "prepped and ready to rock and roll and then we don't have to do nearly as much magic down at the bottom yeah so again imagine I I did it out like that yeah", "start": 263.4, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "it's shallow it's behind me the center mass is behind me but it's just it's making life difficult for me to square it up and for most ofy at home let's", "start": 271.0, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "just work to get it Square in transition or even just have it Square to begin with and just leave it but most of you are a lot of you are actually opening it", "start": 279.96, "duration": 15.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "in transition which makes it really really complicated in our opinion if we go up to the top the opposite of that", "start": 288.36, "duration": 17.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "dish out move to shallow it would be to make that more of that door knob move that we've talked about where you turn", "start": 296.36, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "the door knob while we're turning the door knob we've got to make sure that we're not losing the extension so I like", "start": 305.199, "duration": 15.600999999999999}

{"chunk": "through the wall exactly so actually a good visual we gave before Milo in that doorknob video was using your phone and", "start": 320.919, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "and how normally when we would make that that dish out sort of casty move you see that phone gets kind of the face of it", "start": 329.639, "duration": 17.682}
{"chunk": "gets pointed out towards this way ball line if we're doing it correctly I want the face of that phone to actually get", "start": 338.56, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "more slightly more Skyward and back yeah so that would be leaving the face or even strengthening it just slightly now", "start": 346.44, "duration": 15.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "do we need it to go crazy no a lot of this should happen just with our transition we don't need a gigantic shallowing move", "start": 354.919, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "unless you're like way across the line and stuff but just depends on where you're coming from let's just say we're relatively neutral then it doesn't need to do much you really could just feel", "start": 365.24, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "like you leave it but the torque put on that shaft we want it to be going this way we don't want to be adding some opening Element no no opening elements", "start": 373.639, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "so let's let's do a good one where I go up to the top and I'm going to feel like I'm going to do a freezer and I'm going to add a little bit of this and", "start": 383.72, "duration": 17.518}
{"chunk": "transition kind of that feel you gave me where you held me I got to add a little bit of that twist so now it feels like my right arm goes a little under my left", "start": 392.479, "duration": 17.682}
{"chunk": "and I add a little extension my wrist so it's going that way so you see that club lay down but not lose the face it's not going that", "start": 401.24, "duration": 15.478}
{"chunk": "way if anything it's getting the face is getting a little more back towards you guys in the camera yep and now I'm just going to feel that delivery that face is", "start": 408.759, "duration": 20.162}
{"chunk": "loaded and ready to go where I can just chip one out there and go straight okay perfect so Milo another great drill or", "start": 418.56, "duration": 21.839}
{"chunk": "tool they can use to feel this is the hanger and we've used this plenty of times before what I like about this for this shalling move is you have to really", "start": 437.44, "duration": 17.24}
{"chunk": "feel like it strengthens and transition or else you're not going to get you almost feel have to feel like you're trying to push the the rail of the hanger through your left arm so at setup", "start": 446.599, "duration": 18.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "we kind of start with it up the right arm and our face isn't quite matching we've talked about this before uh on our website we talk about the setup a little", "start": 456.039, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "bit more but for now let's just focus on what we're talking about here in transition so we go up to the top it's going to go from my right forearm to my", "start": 463.44, "duration": 15.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "left arm so you see that that rail it's going to go from here to here okay so if I go up to the top so now it's relatively on my left", "start": 471.24, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "arm maybe it's slightly off who knows depends on the player depends on the player okay but in transition we want you guys to feel like it goes more into", "start": 481.08, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "that left arm so it's pushing into that left arm yes you see when that when that gets pushed up where's the club go it", "start": 489.96, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "goes down and back but the face stays solid if I were to go shallow it but move off the rail you see that face", "start": 498.599, "duration": 16.04}

{"chunk": "aid can give you the feeling of twisting that shaft like I yeah I twisted the shaft for you yeah it can help you feel", "start": 514.0, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "how to do that yeah and I really feel that that bar that rail up in my left forearm now that face is square and loaded up ready to go I can put my hand", "start": 522.279, "duration": 19.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "here and go like that all the way back to the ball so it goes out straight that pressure of that rail in my left arm is what I want to feel in transition and", "start": 531.36, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "all the way through impact this is actually a really hard unit to use it takes time but it's very effective in bringing about the rist conditions we", "start": 541.12, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "want oh yeah so it it really tests you it's good so let's go up to the top I'm going to do that freezer where I add", "start": 549.56, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "that door knob feel boom now I'm loaded up I feel it against my left arm so I got that feedback I need I go and now I", "start": 557.16, "duration": 22.919}
{"chunk": "can make some rehear down to the ball let's get up there again here chips them out so that was pretty nice nice and straight that was a good one okay yep", "start": 568.399, "duration": 17.681}

{"chunk": "that away those are going to turn left which for most players would be nice would be nice cuz they don't ever see the ball turn", "start": 639.519, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "left okay let's do one more here I'm going to try a little bit more of a flighty blower okay so you see it's still", "start": 647.0, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "starting a little out to the right making it difficult for me it's slightly blocking you not letting you get it all the way back Square yeah the thing with training AIDS is they're not necessarily", "start": 655.6, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "meant to be easy and they're not necessarily meant for you to hit perfect shots I think a lot of people get training AIDS and like ah this is too hard I don't like it well it's supposed to be hard yeah it's supposed to", "start": 664.639, "duration": 17.92}
