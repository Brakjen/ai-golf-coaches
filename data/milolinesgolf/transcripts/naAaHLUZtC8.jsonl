{"chunk": "Tiger Woods, but what do you think your interpretation of that move would be? I would guess he's just trying to make sure he creates enough depth with his pelvis. So he's getting his pelvis far", "start": 65.119, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "enough back behind him so he's got room to play with as he turns through the shot cuz his tendency is to have his belt kind of firing more up in the way", "start": 73.76, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "which causes him to have more side bend and it's harder on his already bad back. Right. And one other thought or one", "start": 82.479, "duration": 18.241}

{"chunk": "Uh-huh. So, you know, this is something we've talked about before on these videos is sort of getting that right hip deep to start with. So, it sets you up", "start": 109.2, "duration": 16.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "to get the left hip deep for sure. Right. So, in that video, you know, he's just talking about getting his pelvis as", "start": 117.759, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "far out of his own way and then the other side of his pelvis is far out of his way so he can turn and hit it and", "start": 125.119, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "not get bunched up like this. Because if you've got a back that is fused, we really don't want to put a lot of bend into it.", "start": 132.239, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "Yeah. And the bend we want to have happen, we want to have happen from a lot higher up in the segments. We want maybe from the the rib cage up to be bending, but the", "start": 141.52, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "lower back to be really in a stable state, right? And so I would say that that's probably what he's the way he's feeling it. Now,", "start": 148.959, "duration": 19.761}

{"chunk": "like he's almost arching his back a little bit, getting his chest up. And generally I like the the the lower spine to stay a little bit more in flexion, a", "start": 175.519, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "little bit less of arch look, a little bit more like of contracted abs. Yeah. Keeps things more stable. And it looks", "start": 184.64, "duration": 17.758}
{"chunk": "like he's kind of almost stretching his stomach out. Yeah. As he's changing direction. Well, off Yeah. Off camera, I asked you about this. like it it looked like he", "start": 194.159, "duration": 18.481}

{"chunk": "So, so and what you said was basically you get your upper spine extended at this point and then as you, you know,", "start": 220.159, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "get flexed in your hips and you're bent over more, you actually become, you get back more to a rounded state, right? That's what kind of you would prefer to", "start": 228.879, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "see, right? Most really good players are getting more into flexion. Their pelvis is actually not", "start": 238.159, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "this way relative to their their upper body. Everything compresses into the ground, but the pelvis doesn't go more down than the chest does.", "start": 244.879, "duration": 17.122}
{"chunk": "Yeah. You don't see that much extension in the the lumbar spine like that. So, one other thing I noticed when he was doing this video or I guess he wasn't", "start": 253.68, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "doing the video, he's practicing on the driving range. When he did that sort of sit down or sit almost back, right, and", "start": 262.0, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "chest down the club, his hands dropped pretty significantly and the club was pretty vertical. Mhm. Right. So to me, like is that move", "start": 269.199, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "really producing a more a shallowing motion necessarily or Well, not if he did exactly like it was in slow motion there,", "start": 279.199, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "right? So it's like feel versus real, right? Exactly. But I guess this kind of segus into what", "start": 287.28, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "when you look at that motion, do you think that there's maybe a better way he could have gone about getting into the ground? I guess per se or", "start": 295.52, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "possibly. But what a person feels to get the body to do what they want it to do and what actually they they do sometimes is different. And you know, Tiger's", "start": 304.56, "duration": 19.76}
{"chunk": "Tiger, he's pretty good. And I'm not going to question him with what he needs to feel cuz I've seen him do some crazy stuff with his golf swing. You know, a", "start": 314.32, "duration": 15.281}

{"chunk": "you know, it might not actually match up with what he is really trying to make it do. All right. So, okay. So, let's say for", "start": 338.479, "duration": 18.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "our viewers at home, they're looking to get more into the ground and keep their chest more on top of the ball, opening up, cuz that's one thing in the video,", "start": 348.16, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "you didn't really see Tiger do a lot. He was more he was still kind of closed as he did it, right? But in other videos, you've talked about", "start": 356.639, "duration": 15.600999999999999}

{"chunk": "there. He was playing really good, right? So for for us at home that want to work on this movement of getting sort", "start": 391.44, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "of the chest down and falling into the ground, what would be sort of the first step for me? So I want you to really feel like you're as you're changing", "start": 399.36, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "directions, it's your both your chest and your your belt buckle are coming down kind of at an equal rate. So, you don't really want to feel like you're", "start": 407.12, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "arching your back. Like if if you stayed up like this and now arch your back down. That's We don't really want that. Okay. I'd rather see both come down kind", "start": 415.84, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "of together. Okay. And still like like you were saying, I'm still somewhat closed. And then up to this point is when I start to", "start": 425.039, "duration": 15.679}

{"chunk": "the belt or the the pelvis and the chest have turned about the same amount. At impact, generally the the pelvis is turned slightly more, but just barely", "start": 448.8, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "post impact, they catch up and they're and they're they then the chest is winning the race cuz it goes farther around generally than the belt does.", "start": 458.24, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "Unless you want to fall down. All right. Well, I think Tiger played well after that move. He played really good. I think he played at Memorial and he shot like something", "start": 466.8, "duration": 16.16}
