{"chunk": "our hands travel in the golf swing yeah i'd say through a lot of research and just looking at golf swings players that have stronger grips and", "start": 37.44, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "stronger faces at the top of their swing their hands generally don't move as much down in the downswing and by that they don't need as much", "start": 46.239, "duration": 18.641}

{"chunk": "i would say our paths differ a fair amount if you look especially up towards from p3 to p5 or so", "start": 119.84, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "right your hands tend to get more vertical yep and then they sort of shallow back on plane mine get a little deeper", "start": 129.759, "duration": 15.92}

{"chunk": "right so your your your wingspan's actually greater than your height whereas i'm more about about even yeah right so for me", "start": 161.84, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "you know my arms might feel like they swing a little more around me maybe they feel like they swing around you but their hands get higher yeah i can't make them", "start": 171.599, "duration": 15.441}
{"chunk": "go more around i feel like i make them go perfectly around and they go up yeah so now why would that be well there's a lot of variables there", "start": 179.2, "duration": 15.597999999999999}
{"chunk": "but i would say where the joints are placed so my elbow might be in a slightly different position than yours relative to my hands so when they hinge", "start": 186.959, "duration": 16.322}

{"chunk": "you might call it than mine yeah um you don't get as crazy as some people out there but there's a little bit of that but yeah i would say that the path at the", "start": 212.64, "duration": 18.56}

{"chunk": "something that helps it just depends on the player but you have to understand how to match things to their grip and their face so that their path lines up", "start": 239.2, "duration": 16.64}

{"chunk": "their handle gets really low through the hitting area and it kind of looks like their impact's more like that and i've also seen you coach players more like myself where it's a little", "start": 422.4, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "stronger and my hands actually travel from back here they actually move out towards the ball in transition something", "start": 431.28, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "that we've gotten comments on and said you shouldn't be doing that you shouldn't be practicing that well i gotta get the club to the ball", "start": 438.88, "duration": 15.998}
{"chunk": "somehow right yeah and since you already have a strong club face you don't any lowering of the handle like this now your club face is dead shut up that", "start": 446.319, "duration": 17.842}
{"chunk": "ball's going dead left we were also talking off the camera about how it seems like a lot of the hand paths we've seen over time", "start": 455.28, "duration": 16.558}
{"chunk": "especially a lot of the the legends of old their hand path was a little bit more in towards the pocket", "start": 463.599, "duration": 15.762}
{"chunk": "then kind of up the plane and then out slightly in transition yeah i would say that would probably be the most common pattern you'd see amongst great players", "start": 471.28, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "and up out okay but isn't that over the top the path of the hands really doesn't dictate whether or not you're over the top you can be over the you can have your hands", "start": 481.28, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "coming over the top and have the club shallowing out exactly yeah and then the hands come in late there's a lot of ways", "start": 490.72, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "to do it and if anything it's a little bit of the opposite yeah i find that the hands coming down like this is a much more you're much", "start": 499.599, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "more apt to tumble it out over the top yeah and then even in the takeaway i was just thinking if my hands stay in and low", "start": 507.36, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "typically those are the players of the club stays out in front of them yeah right and then like you said if the hands travel back", "start": 515.12, "duration": 19.279}
{"chunk": "out on the plane typically if you don't pull down that club will fall behind so it's almost the opposite it's like i", "start": 524.24, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "i like to go back to just swinging a baseball bat swinging a stick if my hands went down like this", "start": 533.44, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "the barrel would never want to kick back where i want it so i want my hands to travel into the ark i want them on right away yeah", "start": 541.92, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "and then the barrel lines up i don't really like to see a lot of down in a golf swing if i can if all the other variables are there now there are", "start": 551.12, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "reasons for that to be there and some players i'll send them into that pattern but it's not not my preference", "start": 559.76, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "so as you can see from this topic it's a fairly complicated topic hand path in which way the hands should go", "start": 567.92, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "you know there's lots of variations i would say let's just there's a window the hands either go", "start": 575.44, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "kind of toward the ball or down towards your toes and they follow that channel if they're going more back than that it's probably too far back and if", "start": 584.16, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "they're going much more out than the ball it's probably too far out so let's kind of try to stay in that corridor and not get too nitpicky about", "start": 592.8, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "the hand path as long as our club path is decent all right milo so i have a way we can show the difference between you and me again similar grips", "start": 601.68, "duration": 20.72}
{"chunk": "but we're gonna have slightly different hand paths in the golf swing so i'm gonna give you a golf ball i'm gonna get a golf ball", "start": 611.92, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "and we're gonna feed these up and you're gonna stand right behind me try not to kill me and i'll try not to kill you well how about that i'll prac i'll try my best not to", "start": 621.12, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "shank it into you it's more me potentially killing you right yeah let me see your fall through real fast i gotta move back about really no not", "start": 630.32, "duration": 18.158}
{"chunk": "much just so i can be confident in my not getting killed okay i'm gonna have the assistant kill the the boss right", "start": 642.0, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "okay you ready all right when are we going i'll count us down three two one", "start": 650.56, "duration": 19.997999999999998}
{"chunk": "i pureed it me too good i'll try to slow that down hopefully they're comparable in timing", "start": 660.079, "duration": 15.402000000000001}

{"chunk": "all right guys we hope you enjoyed this video like we said it's a complex topic but don't try to get so nitpicky with your hand path let's let's see how that", "start": 683.68, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
