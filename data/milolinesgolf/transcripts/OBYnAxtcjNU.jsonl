{"chunk": "and my preference and I think the simplest way to chip is your body has to rotate for this to happen but it's to maintain a nice wide structure where your arms and wrists are", "start": 23.699, "duration": 18.24}

{"chunk": "generally speaking just when it comes to radius if it looks like this that's really good and simple but I could also very easily chip like you", "start": 210.0, "duration": 16.999000000000002}

{"chunk": "plane yeah way underneath the plane my pattern is slightly over the plane and then back on the plane it's really good players you rarely see the club", "start": 243.36, "duration": 17.040000000000003}
{"chunk": "load under the plane I'll see it if they use a lot of risk I'll see it kind of load above the plane and then stay there if they're trying to cut across it or have a little shallowing you can", "start": 252.18, "duration": 16.14}

{"chunk": "load the shaft really just comes down to personal preference and how your hands naturally load and if you watch good players in their full swings you'll see that their wrists set at very different", "start": 275.94, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "points right so that has a lot to do with kind of how your hands should work or shouldn't work in the Chip Shop okay let's uh walk everybody through one", "start": 284.34, "duration": 15.600000000000001}

{"chunk": "arms aren't going to have a lot of breaking and folding from there if we're just letting them kind of go along so then we're going to go back through same body motion I'll just chip it out", "start": 327.0, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "there to the pad of the green back through and you can see I barely loaded the wrist there just barely and what I like is you actually", "start": 335.88, "duration": 18.959}

{"chunk": "explain this is once this club kind of breaks being in line with my lead arm I want to get it back in line with my lead arm as soon as I can", "start": 385.5, "duration": 15.299}
{"chunk": "because that always is something that makes sense to people so in a real simple world for a chip shot that doesn't require speed it just kind of stays in line with our Elite arm", "start": 393.66, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "however if we use a bunch of hinge the sooner I get this thing back in line on the downswing the easier chipping is going to be for you so the one thing I", "start": 401.52, "duration": 17.939}

{"chunk": "that's where my I would argue that's why I have such a good short game because I can get away with a lot more handle acceleration than you can yeah if I", "start": 429.18, "duration": 16.858999999999998}
{"chunk": "accelerate the handle I am you're in big trouble because if I look like this and I accelerate the handle it doesn't steepen my attack angle at all but if I", "start": 438.24, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "look like this and I accelerate the handle now I'm sticking the club in there yeah so that's where the advantage of using", "start": 447.12, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "less risk comes into play Under Pressure for me yes that's something to be aware of that's if you're someone who has a lot more", "start": 454.199, "duration": 16.201}

{"chunk": "no hands sometimes I do use hands but you have to be aware of that when you go out on the golf course that's the secret you have to learn how to manage Tempo yeah I don't use a lot of wrists in my", "start": 471.24, "duration": 18.061}
{"chunk": "chip shots but once I have to have some feel for distance I can't con I can't control distance without my wrists I feel like my wrists", "start": 479.94, "duration": 18.96}

{"chunk": "struggled with contact with my wrist set really early in chipping so I got I've spent a lot of time a lot of time getting really good at using very little", "start": 498.539, "duration": 15.18}
