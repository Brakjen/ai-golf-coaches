{"chunk": "what i see and how we can make it better it just gets worse and worse well it's not going to stay worse and worse we're going to make it better", "start": 88.64, "duration": 15.278999999999998}
{"chunk": "and now when i start aiming what i think is parallel left to the target i just pull it further left yeah okay i got a couple videos we can just", "start": 100.96, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "step right up here and walk through what's going on quick off no that's a dumb idea", "start": 113.52, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "golf's fun what else are you gonna do as you swing back your body kind of goes into it kind of bends this way", "start": 124.079, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "okay so instead of if we can get your body to bend a little bit more to the left it's going to make it a lot easier", "start": 132.08, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "and then as you change directions you change directions with your hands first so see how what's the first thing to move hands instead of the lower body", "start": 141.44, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "yeah so your hands are first and because your hands are first they get out so if my hands go first they go out", "start": 150.319, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "that's why you pull it so the key is we need to we need to get your sequencing just a little better and your club face is actually really open", "start": 158.8, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "and then you close it a lot late and hit kind of a yeah low pull you you had yourself pegged right here", "start": 168.64, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "you swing it back that left arm breaks down i think we can make that a little bit better by getting the tilts to work better so", "start": 177.04, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "how you bend so as you start back because your body wants to go like this your arms break down if we can work on see how i'm making", "start": 184.159, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "this left shoulder go down and my right shoulder come up this bend is going to make it a lot easier for you to keep your arm", "start": 195.28, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "structure also a lot easier for you to turn and hit it from the inside when you go this way", "start": 203.44, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "the only way you feel like you can swing from the inside is to tilt which is why you hit it fat yeah so when i'm here like this and i want to start it to the right", "start": 212.48, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "i have to go like that and i dump it in the ground yeah okay so we can get you to feel like you're bent like this now your arms can stay back and you can", "start": 221.12, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "turn and start it on online okay i use both though and this one's gonna go across your chest so you're gonna like hug it okay hold it like that okay", "start": 229.28, "duration": 19.28}

{"chunk": "this turn significantly steeper than that so what that feels like so now i can see your spine is bent this way where normally when you turn you turn", "start": 273.759, "duration": 16.162}
{"chunk": "like this yeah so feel the difference there okay now turn through to the other side and make that same relationship happen", "start": 281.6, "duration": 20.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "so you're gonna try to click the sticks good good see how i'm letting my chest come down toward my belt", "start": 289.68, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "and then bending over a little bit this is what you tend to want to do you see the difference this versus this if you just relax like", "start": 300.8, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "this and slump [Music] there we go that's better so you're just", "start": 310.56, "duration": 16.799}

{"chunk": "all we're focused on is getting that bend right and then from there if we want to go faster we just get this to go out of the way", "start": 664.0, "duration": 17.040000000000003}
{"chunk": "quicker quicker oh it was pretty better yeah that's really good and it actually", "start": 673.76, "duration": 21.439999999999998}

{"chunk": "yeah you better turn it off and try to hit that's why you tried to hit it with your hands out of the top it's because you were turned like this and if you could move your hands down", "start": 708.399, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "and kind of hit it because if you actually used your body you'd hit it way farther left yeah feel really slouchy really round and", "start": 716.959, "duration": 16.722}

{"chunk": "it's a pleasure to see the ball do that i agree that's nice yeah and with some altitude to it versus before my you know what it was pull left it was low", "start": 755.92, "duration": 20.238}
{"chunk": "low level green yep still works yeah that was even better my mind was saying here comes the big chunk", "start": 768.48, "duration": 17.438000000000002}
{"chunk": "oh it was beautiful look at that high draw you're gonna fly that sucker right on the green that should be your intent to see that ball every time start out just slightly", "start": 780.079, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "to the right for a while okay that's a good one to walk off on right there i think that was the best one that's as good as it gets yeah right next to the pan", "start": 792.48, "duration": 17.117}

{"chunk": "and your shoulders pin back like this because now you're you're just locked you locked yourself up yeah okay and that allows you to turn on this steeper plane", "start": 822.16, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "from there you're naturally going to be able to hit the inside of the ball it doesn't i understand that now yeah sweet yeah well then that's i set out to to accomplish it and we did yeah", "start": 830.88, "duration": 24.878}
