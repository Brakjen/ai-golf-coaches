{"chunk": "couple of players as well so tell us a little bit about kind of what your academy does yeah sure so", "start": 61.6, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "milo and i were just discussing what what elite really is and that's from our perspective as coaches here we're looking to really build and", "start": 70.96, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "develop junior players primarily that's kind of the spine of our program as junior development and what we do is is a little bit different than", "start": 79.04, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "i would say typical instruction which is you know 30 minutes of golf instruction or 60 minutes of golf instructure instruction buy a series of 10 lessons", "start": 87.2, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "or whatever well we love getting 10 year olds in 12 year olds in because our vision is to build golfers that are", "start": 96.479, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "going to go play at the college level right so if we get a 12 year old and shoot we've got them for six years until they go off to school um so with that we'll get players at all", "start": 104.64, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "different spectrums some of them are are highly competitive when they come in like jack de cesare came in and is obviously a very very skilled player already thanks to a lot of the work that", "start": 113.84, "duration": 19.679}
{"chunk": "you've done with the milo um but also players that are brand new to the game they don't even know if they like golf yet so we're", "start": 123.68, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "in the midst of developing them as obviously players but also as young men and women so goal number one with those kids is to get them to fall in love with", "start": 131.92, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "golf right fall in love with this awesome game that's our number one job is to develop that love just the liking of coming out and", "start": 140.08, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "spending time with our coaches their peers you name it but they're eager to get out here and spend time with the golf course swinging this around right which is obviously different than", "start": 148.72, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "players that are like already super super vested in playing the game so maybe we can talk about just like the", "start": 157.2, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "building process of obviously like great players like dana that you coach or you know some of the kids that are in", "start": 164.08, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "college that that we both coach now whether it's like julie huggins that plays at mizzou or dylan stewart that's oklahoma state or whatever how we would coach those players", "start": 172.959, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "compared to players that are a little bit newer to the game yeah let's get there let's okay so we both coached some players that are already kind of at the top of the game", "start": 181.12, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "yep let's talk a little bit about how we would take a player who's just starting off and help them to kind of develop into that top player so", "start": 189.04, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "when you get a new player what's that what do you do first uh well when it comes to technique i think we'll start there", "start": 197.599, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "i think both of us are we love flexion rotators rather than extension extension-tilled athletes right we naturally kind of gravitate to", "start": 206.319, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "that and that's what's great about having a newer player that doesn't necessarily have a pattern yet is you can help instill the pattern", "start": 214.319, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "so for instance our developmental program we've got a six-tier curriculum that kids work through um we test them", "start": 222.319, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "once a month so at fastest they can finish that program or they can finish that program in six months", "start": 230.48, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "so right um being tested based on their skill set is that kind of what you're doing we're building the skill set so we build the skill set and then we", "start": 239.28, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "test it from a written perspective if you pass the written exam and pass the physical exam you're on to the next level it's very similar to the karate", "start": 246.56, "duration": 15.197999999999999}
{"chunk": "belt system right you come on the white hat level you work through that month if you pass through then you can go into the yellow hat level but you have to test out have", "start": 254.319, "duration": 18.002}
{"chunk": "to test out so within that we're building foundational elements from grip posture how to understand alignment", "start": 263.28, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "all of those basics and then from there building movement into that so i think cameron was telling you a bit", "start": 271.68, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "about you know we can't necessarily tell an eight-year-old right off the bat hey show me hip flexion and chest rotation with a little bit of bend in your ribs", "start": 278.8, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "we can't tell them that right compared to a player that's been in the curriculum for a long time they understand that terminology", "start": 287.84, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "but those players that come in new we teach them all those different you have to walk them through these pieces slowly exactly so we build the same language so when any one of our coaches goes hey", "start": 295.52, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "show me a little bit of pelvic depth and we need to get your heart up towards the target a little bit more so you can cover it better now they understand what the heck we're talking about", "start": 304.56, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "right so i think from my perspective building a 12 year old is really really fun because we're building that player from that", "start": 313.52, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "technique perspective in that example we have other coaches on like alex trevino tj kathenberg that are very very knowledgeable in decade and we can break", "start": 321.039, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "decade down which is like so much information a decade obviously like crazy that rabbit hole like never ends from", "start": 329.52, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "the surface level foundational standpoint of decade you can still take those foundations and instill them into those players like", "start": 338.639, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "okay maybe it's 25 yards out or 30 yards out away from the green what score should i expect to have from here and maybe at a beginner level", "start": 347.6, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "i learn a hybrid chip to just scoot it up on the green i have good enough pace control with my first putt to get it fairly close", "start": 356.24, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "knock in the next one so they're scoring zone area is i need to get the golf ball in the hole at three at maximum so they're starting to understand that yeah it is a game of", "start": 363.44, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "score the lower the better and i'm doing that through techniques we're really building like technique principles strategy principles", "start": 372.88, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "mindset principles you name it from the ground up we kind of laid out the groundwork of how we get a player started how we get them introduced to movements to the", "start": 381.52, "duration": 19.279}
{"chunk": "strategy of the game so now that they're starting to like this game now that they like it how do we take that player and help them to develop into an elite level", "start": 391.199, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "player one that can actually go play tournaments and sure make it on his wall make it on that wall baby so um", "start": 400.4, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "great now is different than when you and i were growing up right like as juniors you just enter whatever state association junior state association", "start": 408.16, "duration": 15.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "that you have that's kind of our only option right now we've got pga junior league uh u.s kids golf x3", "start": 415.919, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "ping enter club there's like a million different options especially down here in arizona these are things i'm gonna have to pick your brain on i've got a little boy wanting to learn how to play yep and", "start": 424.08, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "i didn't start golf as a junior so i missed out on all of that i went i went straight to playing college golf basically i played one year in high school and then straight into college golf you started playing your senior", "start": 433.52, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "year that's really awesome and then went one year into college that's that's tremendous that's cool so i'm not familiar with a lot of this and with", "start": 442.319, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "what i do as a coach you know i'm at a private club where almost everybody's 55 or older and the good players i do see they you know", "start": 450.88, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "they come see me for a reason so i'm not getting a chance to to do what you just described building somebody from the very foundations sure", "start": 459.12, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "and then those next layers yeah so like i think the next rung on our ladder is okay if i start off on a basketball team as a", "start": 467.28, "duration": 18.159000000000002}
{"chunk": "kid i just don't want to go to practice every day and work on layout drills like that gets boring and stale eventually i want to play a game so", "start": 476.4, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "as we were discussing like pga junior league is one of the best introductions to tournament golf that there is because", "start": 484.319, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "pga juniorly is a team environment where every hole there's three players that take on another three players one of those players is the caddy and the other", "start": 493.36, "duration": 16.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "two two players on one team are competing against the other two players in a scramble format and golf tends to be fairly intimidating", "start": 502.479, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "from a competitive standpoint because it just is me if i'm screwing up all day i don't have anybody that's got my back", "start": 510.24, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "so it's like whoa getting into in the tournament golf it exposes you real fast it exposes you real fast and at 12 years old", "start": 518.399, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "that's sometimes daunting right so getting into pga junior a great option um options at the levels above that would be more", "start": 526.32, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "traditional kinds of competition metal play that's x3 that's us kids golf us kids golf when you're younger i believe they start with tournaments", "start": 535.68, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "that are six holes only six and they build up to nine holes and then to 18 eventually and they set the yardages up so appropriate for the kids too exactly", "start": 544.959, "duration": 16.799000000000003}
{"chunk": "exactly and i think from a coaching perspective they're like building the player don't build we don't like building like", "start": 553.519, "duration": 16.802}
{"chunk": "this one tournament we need to do x it's more in the next six months what we would like to build on top of is this this this and this right depending on", "start": 561.12, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "you know the strengths of the player and the gaps that need to be filled so going out early and struggling with putting and experiencing", "start": 571.12, "duration": 17.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "a lot of three putts is okay because again it exposes you golf has this wonderful way of never lying to you it will tell you what's going on in your", "start": 579.76, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "game if you're paying attention to it so over the course of time as you build your putting whether it's pace control or", "start": 588.72, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "line control or both you name it you can eliminate some putts off your score so from day one to six months you'll see", "start": 597.2, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "the improvement because of the work that you've done off the golf course or outside of competition and then you'll you'll reap those rewards as time passes", "start": 605.68, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "so now we've kind of covered the the building blocks of how to build these good golfers let's get into a little bit of the actual technical yeah", "start": 614.24, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "because part of the thing that draws me to you and wanting to bring you on the channel is we're fairly like-minded in what we what we believe in from a", "start": 622.16, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "movement standpoint um so let's let's just get into some of the the technical aspects of building a good golf swing sure", "start": 631.12, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "what are you looking for as you're as you're developing this good golf swing what are some of the things we're looking for we mentioned earlier we want", "start": 638.72, "duration": 16.800000000000004}
{"chunk": "we both like players that are in flexion and rotating not extension yes sorry let's let's walk the people at home through what that", "start": 647.2, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "looks like beautiful so i'll actually hop in i'll let you be there you can show this stuff awesome so i think this camera angle is actually really really cool this is one of my", "start": 655.76, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "favorite camera angles to actually check this out um and folks at home if you set your camera off to the side at kind of a 45 you'll start to see some really cool", "start": 663.92, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "things in your golf swing i mean traditional camera angles are face on and down the line and that's kind of all we see that camera angle and booty view", "start": 672.24, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "posterior it's a really good stuff unbelievably cool so um let's start with the booboos first what we don't like extension tilters so", "start": 680.0, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "when i'm saying extension extension simply from the hips or the pelvis that's an extension move that's a flexion move", "start": 688.0, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "if i go from the top and i immediately get this trail hip working towards the golf ball even if i'm rotating that's trail hip extension", "start": 695.76, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "and what that does is typically it'll pitch the golf club over the plane and as a good player i'll tilt which is", "start": 704.32, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "l spine bend so the difference between bend and tilt bend we like seeing ben yeah we like bend from the", "start": 712.0, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "from the rib cage ribs change upward t spine yeah t spine bend l spine bend no good that's too much it leaks down into the lower back no good on your back", "start": 719.76, "duration": 18.798}
{"chunk": "obviously for it not designed for it just too much load that's where all of our injuries most of the injuries come in golf right so", "start": 728.959, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "if we're going strictly pelvic rotation trail hip extension i've got to reconfigure the structure of the golf club like now the golf club's in a", "start": 736.079, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "hittable position at least if i'm a good player i'm going to do this and not just load it in a way that it's not loaded it's not good for it totally i'm good not good for it from a health", "start": 744.959, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "perspective and i've just screwed up my bottom out big time so now i'm going to have the bottom out it wants to be back here unless i rake on the handle", "start": 753.6, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "but eventually that's going to bounce and now i lose my face control so all the things that we look for precision speed", "start": 761.839, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "and health all go out the window with that kind of a movement pattern right so instead when we get to the top we'd love", "start": 769.839, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "to see this trail hit squeeze just a bit so that pelvis is working away or i'd put like if i had a ball or a wall or whatever i'm putting pressure", "start": 777.12, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "into that like rear side and now i can rotate here that rotation in my t-spine is what's now going to go ahead and control my face", "start": 786.56, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "control the bottom out super healthy pattern as well so we're living good if we're doing that yeah we're safe we move the bottom of the arc", "start": 795.519, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "forward yep we can create lots of speed and face stability tons of speed like and even with speed you look at like a lot of the long drive guys they they", "start": 803.68, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "extend eventually harder than what we're talking about right now like with the wedge we want to see players like stay in flexion for", "start": 812.079, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "like a long long time forever right it's a slightly different pattern than trying to hit it 400 yards yes slightly different pattern exactly you like load up your waves a little different your", "start": 820.16, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "energy whips just a bit different so your body responds differently but still just seeing that basic flexion rotation type of a pattern", "start": 829.519, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "is huge we can really see that we're both really on the same page i know anybody who's watched my channel will see that this basically", "start": 838.32, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "is what i am preaching from a different guy let's just talk a little bit about what we can do with our bodies off the golf", "start": 846.56, "duration": 15.119000000000002}
{"chunk": "course and how we can take care of ourselves so that this is easier for us to do sure so do you like to see players that are really thick upper", "start": 855.36, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "bodies who have been really hitting the gym hard or would you rather see that kind of wiry build uh preferably", "start": 863.92, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "i'd like to see the wire wiry build because there's just more bounce in that right we're huge on and i've learned this from luke brackey", "start": 872.16, "duration": 15.758}
{"chunk": "who both of us know very well this model of like tensegrity is really really cool it's just general movement patterns like", "start": 879.839, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "gate patterns for instance just walking or like this movement here i've got one muscle group one fascial line on so there's", "start": 889.279, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "energy in it it's hard and another group is soft and then i can bounce out of that general walking pattern same thing if i", "start": 898.48, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "take a step bang parts of my body light up others chill out and then i can bounce from that boom out of there to like the different side of the other", "start": 906.48, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "muscle group side so when you have those like thick guys they tend to be like on all the time and it's pretty difficult for them to", "start": 914.8, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "bounce like the muscles don't elongate and bounce out of there so it's difficult there's much elasticity in their movement exactly not as much elasticity", "start": 923.12, "duration": 15.678}
{"chunk": "you can see that with professional golfers i've watched lots of them when they show up in their 20s and they're these little string beans who can hit the ball 350. then they think they need to get in the", "start": 931.519, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "weight room they get in the weight room they bulk up did they hit it farther not at all usually they hit it shorter and more crooked you see that in rory", "start": 940.16, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "actually i mean it's not right here and you see it in tiger right guys like neiman i mean shoot nina's not a tall guy", "start": 948.639, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "doesn't weigh a lot and he hits it plenty far i mean the guy hits it tremendous different distances and that's what's interesting like last year's us over maybe it's two years ago", "start": 956.48, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "neiman's hitting it further than the shambo and their ball speeds are completely different right he's just a little bit more efficient but he's a heck of a smaller guy totally different", "start": 965.839, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "build than what the chambo looks like so it doesn't necessarily mean that like mass is equaling more efficiency in our ball", "start": 974.32, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "maybe you get a little bit more speed potentially but what's that actually doing to the golf ball and to your body yeah i much prefer to see a little bit", "start": 983.04, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "more wiry kind of more just general athletic looking body like somebody who could go play basketball yeah you know big strong buff dude bouncing on a basketball court it's not", "start": 992.079, "duration": 17.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "very bouncy and they tire out too fast yes exactly tire out too fast that's 100 right so again all these are preferences like", "start": 1001.36, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "lots of guys there there's some just genetics that guys are going to be a little bit thicker than others others that's quite obvious but i think what we're both saying is you don't have to", "start": 1008.959, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "go hit the gym to go create speed or distance in your game that's not the equator hopefully you guys can all see that", "start": 1018.24, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "building a golfer is not really one a one-off lesson type deal for both of us it's kind of more we take ownership and we really want to", "start": 1026.799, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "work with the player long term because we want to see see patterns change over the course of time not over the course of five minutes so yeah i think what's", "start": 1035.76, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "what's really cool here is is we both see like our game is such a skill sport it's probably the biggest skill sport", "start": 1045.199, "duration": 16.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "that there is like if i throw a baseball really hard in a certain window i don't necessarily have to hit well", "start": 1053.12, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "on our game you still have to hit well right you have to be the manager of the outfield the whole bit to be able to like play this game at a super high level so you", "start": 1061.28, "duration": 17.36}
