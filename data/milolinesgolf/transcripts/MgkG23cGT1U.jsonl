{"chunk": "everybody welcome back out to superstition mountain it's a beautiful summery day and we're answering some questions we've had from", "start": 0.719, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "subscribers to the channel and from our website and one of those was about different backswing positions right and how that", "start": 8.16, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "affects what happens i believe yeah how they how they transition from those positions and the differences we see", "start": 17.359, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "[Music] okay so what are the the positions we see well let's just make them kind of broad", "start": 26.22, "duration": 18.261}
{"chunk": "yeah so first one would be kind of cross the line second one would be kind of neutral on plane", "start": 35.6, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "and the third one would be kind of laid off yep so what happens from each of those things", "start": 43.2, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "so if a player gets the golf club back and the club is across the line like this where is the center of mass located", "start": 53.28, "duration": 21.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "center of mass for this golf club it's on that side of my hands right yeah so as i change directions and my my", "start": 62.96, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "body the pivot motion starts to put a torque on this club what does that tend to do to the club see how that works yeah i guess the center mass moving back behind you the", "start": 74.0, "duration": 15.839999999999998}
{"chunk": "center of mass wants to move pitch back right because there's no way if it stayed out in front of you you'd ever hit the ball it's not going to do that you definitely", "start": 82.72, "duration": 15.118999999999998}
{"chunk": "wouldn't hit it well when i change directions this thing's going to produce like a whirly bird yeah it's going to do that so that's more that tip the bat", "start": 90.4, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "sensation and so that would be like a my baseball player who's got the barrel up when they change directions the barrel kicks back like this", "start": 99.6, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "and goes into the ball so very matte wolf is a good example he would be like the most extreme one in current golf right yeah really this way now", "start": 108.32, "duration": 21.679}
{"chunk": "one thing that always applies to the guys who are up and across like that they have big turns because they need time the fact if that", "start": 118.719, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "bat's gotta or that club head's gotta go from here all the way around like this if i did it with a short backswing like", "start": 128.64, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "this i would never have enough time right right so that's the the one thing you have to watch out for if you like the feel of being up", "start": 136.4, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "and across like this you better make a nice big turn to give yourself plenty of time to unwind it okay let's talk about the second one the", "start": 144.56, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "more on plane i guess good examples would be sort of tiger adam scott yeah so it's like your picture perfect", "start": 152.319, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "golf swing tiger from like most of his career but really from like 99 to 2000 two", "start": 160.879, "duration": 15.202}
{"chunk": "was like you know pretty mint adam scott there's there's quite a few guys who get that club kind of where it looks like it's planed out perfectly and it doesn't", "start": 167.68, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "really shift planes all that much yep and what's happening with those guys they get it up here the center of mass is behind their hands", "start": 177.04, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "already but the direction that the that my pivot's gonna put torque on the golf club doesn't make it do much so it just kind", "start": 184.8, "duration": 15.597999999999999}
{"chunk": "of comes back down yep okay so they're still using their pivot or even if they're driving with their arms the directions the arms are traveling", "start": 192.959, "duration": 16.002}
{"chunk": "make the club stay in the same arc yeah they're not going to see a lot of shallowing they don't need it right so it's going to be pretty much back and", "start": 200.8, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "through and the i'd say the lead wrist in their swings looks pretty flat at that point would you agree with that generally depending on their grip there", "start": 209.84, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "are guys who have strong grips who are maybe a little cup a little cupped and pretty neutral and neutral the real thing is it's how they use the", "start": 217.44, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "weight of the golf club they're basically using it up the plane down the plane there's not a lot of shifting in the plane right and then there's the third variety", "start": 226.64, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "so that would be like your ricky fowler he'd be a really good example of somebody who kind of swings it back here and it's laid off now where's that center of mass", "start": 235.599, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "it's way back behind it's back here behind my hands and it's lower yeah and so when my body starts to put this torque", "start": 244.56, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "on the golf club the club starts to move in this way it actually starts to stand up there are guys like sergio has a little bit of that", "start": 252.72, "duration": 17.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "but he just drops the whole unit together and then tumbles it out but at some point that thing's got to tumble out yep and generally", "start": 263.759, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "you're going to see it start to tumble out sooner and guys who do that usually have shorter swings like your john roms your ricky fowler", "start": 270.88, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "ricky has a big turn but a short arm swing yeah like that so let's see if i can hit him with all three", "start": 280.72, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "oh boy but i'm going to try to give an example of each the wolf one will be probably pretty easy for you because you played a lot of baseball", "start": 288.56, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "laid off one i'm i'm guessing i'll have the most trouble with we'll see if i can do it okay so here we go first one the big across the line", "start": 302.96, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "first swing of the day that hurt okay now my best tiger i'm not very good at getting it right on plane", "start": 314.4, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "that would be i like that one yeah well that was a stinger yeah on purpose i bladed it i don't want to mess up this pretty", "start": 327.6, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "grass now the hardest one for me is getting that thing kind of laid off with a little bit of", "start": 339.52, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "flat left wrist or bow like those guys do what do you know i hit that one the best that was a tricky one", "start": 346.639, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "well i guess i was wrong um so you i mean we talked about some of the differences and um the risk conditions where the", "start": 356.08, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "center of mass is on the clubs what about some of the similarities what's is the transition still sort of ignited", "start": 365.36, "duration": 18.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "with what's going on in the lower body and the core yeah so the similarities are how the actual body moves yeah so you see all the guys no matter where the", "start": 374.08, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "club is you're going to see the motion start from the middle so the core you're going to see the the pelvis start to open up which is going to start to pull", "start": 382.639, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "everything around yeah for most players you know there are guys who sequence it slightly different but most of your best players are going to sequence it in that way yeah so", "start": 390.96, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "for me the real key is not where the club is it's how you transition so if you transition correctly the club's going to plane itself out", "start": 400.88, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "where it needs to be yeah it's always amazing when you when you look at that club at the delivery position from where they had it most of the time", "start": 409.68, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "it matters most of them are getting close to the same when they get it here it's going to be somewhere either in line with their hands or just slightly inside of their hands for almost every single point", "start": 418.8, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "their club was here even here or way over there didn't matter where it started it's going to get to right there like that that's why the pros are so good because from here to here it's magic", "start": 427.599, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "which is what really matters is your delivery right from from here to here if we're really good you're going to be really good oh yeah great i mean from those", "start": 436.88, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "different positions they're still similar transitions and what their body's doing and uh you know they match it up great for what they're working with", "start": 445.919, "duration": 18.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "yep so if you guys like this video uh make sure to subscribe and check out our website milolionsgolf.com and make sure you guys leave a comment", "start": 454.72, "duration": 19.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "with uh future video requests we uh we're listening and we're we're trying to put some up for you guys so", "start": 464.479, "duration": 16.48}
