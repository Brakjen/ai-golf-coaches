{"chunk": "how do we keep from being over the top?\" And the answer is simple. It's rotation is not the problem. The problem is where", "start": 18.24, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "the rotation originates, what it comes from. So, let's talk about how we would what it looks like when we do it wrong and what", "start": 28.0, "duration": 18.48}
