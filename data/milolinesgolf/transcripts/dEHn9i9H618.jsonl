{"chunk": "sort of footwork too. So it's pressure shifts. How we use our bodies to maximize the amount of force we're putting into the ground is basically how I would what I", "start": 24.0, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "would call ground work and how we do that to sequence things correctly. Yeah. I think there's a misunderstanding that we teach a swing that is simply", "start": 32.96, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "just spinning the hips or or just opening things up, right? But how do you how do you open things up? spinning", "start": 40.559, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "spinning the hips doesn't put energy into the golf club. So, our number one goal with what we're teaching is to be able to put maximum", "start": 48.719, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "energy into this thing is we want to hit the ball far, right? And in order to do that, we have to be able to send energy up the chain.", "start": 57.52, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "Yeah. So, if all I do is go like this and just spin my hips, that club's not even moving. That's worthless. Well, just to", "start": 66.24, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "use your analogy about baseball too, again, you look at a pitcher, right? Pitcher, he gets up on this right leg. All the pressure is here and then he", "start": 74.159, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "pushes down into that left leg, but he's not already here with the ball. This is all falling back, right? And he's getting into the ground. Baseball", "start": 82.56, "duration": 16.959}

{"chunk": "of set up the turn, set up the power that we need. So let's kind of walk through what that looks like. I'll jump in here. Y um", "start": 99.68, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "so first thing I like to see is in every swing I like to see a little bit of flowing of pressure back and forth as", "start": 108.24, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "we're waggling and looking at our target. And then I like to have a I like a a fairly substantial trigger, something that you can see. I actually", "start": 116.399, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "like a trigger that's either like a a little shift of pressure or a counter rotation, something that I can see that gets flow going, gets the energy moving.", "start": 125.119, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "And so if we were to put me on a pressure plate and see before I pull the club back, when I make my little trigger move like this, that's my move, right?", "start": 134.56, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "My right foot is basically weightless for just a second. And there's all the pressurees in my left foot. So the pressure is going into the ground this direction, right? And what that", "start": 143.36, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "does when the pressure goes into the ground this way, it begins to push me back right to that opposite force slightly. Yeah. So, I'm going to start working", "start": 152.16, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "away from the the ball and then almost immediately, what does my right foot do? Well, you start to pressure into your trail side here.", "start": 160.56, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "Yeah. Cuz if I don't if I just triggered and I never I would just I would wander off to this. And that's what people call a sway. So, yeah,", "start": 169.84, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "a little bit of lateral motion is not a bad thing as long as we catch ourselves with our pressure. So, I I trigger, I start going this way", "start": 177.68, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "and I catch myself. Now, what do I do? I put pressure into my right foot, which that's what that's what winds me up, right? So, the pressure is now going in", "start": 185.12, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "this direction. And that's winding me up. And at some point, it's actually going to start to push me back the other way. So, I'm going to start about the", "start": 193.84, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "time my club gets right here. You'll see this hip actually start to wander back this way back toward the target. Right?", "start": 202.239, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "And so that some call a recentering move. And all that really is is it's timing the force into the ground so that", "start": 210.319, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "it starts to push us back in time. Because a lot of people, they go, I got all my force under this foot, but I actually didn't I didn't put a lot of", "start": 217.599, "duration": 18.639999999999997}
{"chunk": "I didn't put a magnitude of force to center me back up. Well, you and I talk about this all the time is that the golf swing is really such a a spiral to it,", "start": 228.799, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "right? How our bodies move. And that the pressure, while it is going laterally left and right, it's also going back and forth this way, too,", "start": 236.799, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "right? So your little pressure shift left, you kind of push probably a little bit onto the outside of your left foot into your toes a little bit, the arch, and then you push into your right heel.", "start": 245.04, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "So it's already starting to sort of spiral. It's going up and around. Yeah. And then I use my right foot to keep the motion going, right?", "start": 254.0, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "And to start to send me back cuz my my right foot actually starts to send me back toward the target while the club is going this way.", "start": 261.519, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "Okay. So how are we going to level things out now from the top? That's the question, right? So, now I kind of have a trap door under", "start": 270.72, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "me. So, what happens? I get up here and I go wham into the ground, right? And I fall, which makes as I'm beginning", "start": 278.24, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "to unwind, I'm actually a lot lighter than I started. So, I'm 190 lb. And as I change directions and I start down like this, I weigh like 75 lbs. So, there's", "start": 285.759, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "not much gra there's not much happening. I'm really light. Yeah. And so, I get all the way back to square like this. And then I catch myself, right? And when I catch myself, boom. And", "start": 295.6, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "that's when my left foot really bangs into the ground and the force pushes back the other way. And the force pushes back this way. And you'll see my my body go opening up,", "start": 303.759, "duration": 19.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "right? So again, when you got to the top, you didn't just merely spin, right? You first sort of dropped into the", "start": 313.039, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "ground a little bit and that set up the pressure to fight you back and basically that set up the turn. Yeah. So I'm I'm", "start": 321.759, "duration": 15.442}
{"chunk": "falling, catching myself, and turning out of the way. I'm not pushing back up. Mhm. I'm using that as a rotary force. Cuz you could fall, catch yourself, and", "start": 329.52, "duration": 17.998}
{"chunk": "stand up and flip it. You probably hit it pretty hard, but you might not ever find it, right? You catch yourself, and you use that to make your body turn out of the way. And", "start": 338.639, "duration": 18.802}
{"chunk": "what's interesting is when you look at these force plates and pressure plates, they're the maximum pressure in the lead side is before impact. It's not at", "start": 347.68, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "impact. maximum pressure in the lead side is the guys who hit it the farthest make it happen the soonest. Right? So like for me it's at left arm parallel", "start": 357.199, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "is about my maximum force right here. And what's interesting is maximum force happens when your body stops going down. It's not when you feel like you're", "start": 366.16, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "pushing back up. It's actually maximum force happens. It's the thing that stops you. Right? So basically like those this", "start": 375.199, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "trigger a little left pressure here that's setting you up to turn back this way and then you drop and this sets you up to to rotate and turn back that way.", "start": 383.6, "duration": 15.678}

{"chunk": "energy into the golf club. And that's the goal is to put we want this thing going fast, right? So understanding how", "start": 400.4, "duration": 18.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "we're using the ground and creating some movement in our body, these pressure shifts, just like if I was an athlete like a pitcher or a baseball player, you", "start": 408.72, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "know, understanding some of those things and um allowing for some of that freedom, that athletic movement can really set up the rotation that we're", "start": 418.8, "duration": 16.8}
