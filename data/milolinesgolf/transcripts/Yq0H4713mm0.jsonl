{"chunk": "so i'm out here with henry fall and we're talking about how to start your golf swing so that you can maximize potential energy right and we can", "start": 20.4, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "hit the ball as hard as we can because that's what we all want to do we all want to smash it so let's walk through some of these things let's let's say we've already got a pretty good backswing we", "start": 28.96, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "get up to the top of our swing now how do we start right so we get the club to the top many of you at home the first move down", "start": 36.8, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "is this you start to pull down throw and the club gets vertical it gets steep", "start": 45.76, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "it gets steep real fast right or oftentimes they twist this arm this direction so they go into", "start": 53.6, "duration": 17.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "what's called pronation of this arm right away and that puts the club pitched out in front of them and steep and now they've got some issues what's going to happen next well it's", "start": 63.039, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "not not too pretty from here you're not going to be able to rotate like you want that's for sure so you're going to be cutting across the golf ball and what most people do to", "start": 72.479, "duration": 19.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "kind of save that is they start to early extend because that will kind of help shallow that back out late but then contact goes out the window", "start": 81.6, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "right it's really hard to hit it solid consistently when that's what we do out of the top right so we're going to walk you through what we want you to do in transition so that the club pitches", "start": 90.24, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "the right direction and allows you to be able to use your turn to square the club up right let's quickly talk about some other", "start": 99.36, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "athletic movements what else do you see in other sports if you're throwing a baseball do i throw this way no no so how does it start", "start": 106.72, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "the change of direction always starts from the middle of our body so it's our pelvis which makes our our knees and things work so the first thing we see is our pelvis", "start": 116.64, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "start to move yeah and that starts everything else so it's kind of a chain reaction so i guess if it's like other sports we", "start": 125.6, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "probably have to do what we do in other sports i would think so okay so if i'm at the top", "start": 135.52, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "and my first move down is that sort of that move that you just demonstrated as if i was throwing a baseball where i", "start": 142.48, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "kind of plant that left foot not necessarily slide but i kind of plant it and this", "start": 151.76, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "knee goes out look where the club goes if you're not putting a lot of torque into the grip", "start": 159.599, "duration": 16.242}
{"chunk": "this way right naturally yeah you're not pulling down and you're not twisting right then the club naturally wants to pitch back right okay", "start": 167.04, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "so that's what we want to have happen and a really good feel that i like to feel i like to feel like if i was holding your arm here and you're not trying to put any force into it", "start": 176.16, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "you're just letting your arm kind of fall back against you as your other arm gets closer to your body slightly like that and this right forearm you've", "start": 184.72, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "talked about this almost where it supinates it kind of goes under yeah that's what's happening this right hand is actually working this way in", "start": 193.599, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "transition not this way so one thing i like to imagine is like if i'm a waiter and i got a plate of food up here", "start": 201.599, "duration": 17.041}

{"chunk": "exactly you're dishing it out like this not dumping it over on top of them as i get into the ground perfect this way", "start": 217.519, "duration": 19.122}
{"chunk": "so feeling like this stays up just a little bit just a little bit and the the real key to it is the change of direction actually happens while that", "start": 228.799, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "is going back so your hands are actually still working slightly up for the last little bit and that's what holds them up that's the change of direction that's what we want that's", "start": 237.599, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "what creates dynamics i really like that boom so if that's what we do yep our change of direction will be dynamic the", "start": 246.959, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "club will get pitched back behind us we're going to be free to rotate out of the way and launch that ball right i think that's an awesome visual just like if i was a quarterback", "start": 255.519, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "ball's moving back now i start going it's how every sport works yeah that's kind of what i do for me everything is related", "start": 264.479, "duration": 15.76}
