{"chunk": "let's get started here henry i've got up our first major champion of the year hideki matsuyama and let's watch his golf swing", "start": 9.92, "duration": 16.479000000000003}
{"chunk": "at full speed real fast so you can see a lot of the old paws is gone now he's", "start": 18.08, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "he's pausing a lot less than he used to be now i want to draw a couple lines in here the ones i like to use so we're not quite on the right line to", "start": 26.4, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "be able to see if his rear end stays back but close we're almost on the down the line camera view here", "start": 36.0, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "um i also like to put a line in i'm going to change the color of that make it yellow can you imagine how hard he worked on getting that pause out of his swing it", "start": 42.84, "duration": 18.598}
{"chunk": "probably was tough he's probably had that his whole career as long as i've ever seen his golf swing he has so we got his belt line drawn in", "start": 53.039, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "so i like to look at as a player's turning back see if their waistline is turning on the plane of and it turns mostly on plane but he kind", "start": 61.68, "duration": 18.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "of drops down in his swing and then as he reaches the top of his back swing you can see his club face is almost a fraction open it's probably", "start": 69.6, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "just about dead square he kind of has a little bit of a weakish left hand and his club's a little on the laid off side", "start": 79.6, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "it's a slight bow in that lead wrist yeah a slight bow and then right in transition it's hard to see it blurs here but you can see it both ever so slightly more", "start": 88.159, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "cool and what's interesting is we kind of talked about too is that the shallowing or laying down for him it's not necessarily just derived from his", "start": 97.52, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "core and rotation it's also a little bit of manual sort of his hands actually look like they might start it yeah so his golf swing", "start": 106.159, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "it looks like right out of the top his hands are starting to kind of fire and get that club to lay down and then his body just spins out opens up real fast", "start": 114.56, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "yeah and he's a little bit of a a jumper with the driver you can see his waist goes up a little bit he's got some strong legs", "start": 124.079, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "he does and he hits it pretty hard too yeah but the one thing that you notice there is his rear end never moved closer yeah", "start": 132.8, "duration": 15.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "ever now one other thing to point out too is we've talked about before we even did these um videos or these analysis is that", "start": 140.319, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "when you're looking at swings and analyzing these swings keep in mind a lot of these camera angles are all different yeah so this one's not exactly", "start": 149.2, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "it's not exactly perfect how we would set it up if we were analyzing something definitely not a perfect down the line and and that's the thing is like when you're", "start": 157.2, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "looking at swings on pga tour just keep that in mind is that day to day their swings could look different just because of the camera angles yeah so and their swings don't look that", "start": 164.08, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "different day to day you know yeah as you and i know it's hard to make our swings look different yeah but if we change the camera angle by two feet", "start": 173.599, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "they could look totally different yeah so but all in all he follows you can see that club shallows out the club pitches back behind him and his body", "start": 180.959, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "opens up and from a sequencing standpoint his a little different it looks a little almost hands and arms early but he hits all the checkpoints when he", "start": 189.68, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "gets to left arm parallel his knees are right back square where they started when he gets to shaft parallel it's hard to get to stop there", "start": 198.48, "duration": 19.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "there isn't a shaft parallel it's a little above but you can see the shaft in his chest are basically parallel at that point in time which i like to see", "start": 208.48, "duration": 17.518}
{"chunk": "so deki's move is really you know it's really pretty good but it does require some interesting match ups because of his grip yep let's", "start": 216.799, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "go look at the forward on view then cool so let's let's switch over and look at his face on okay so here we have a an interesting view of hideki i'm going to zoom in just", "start": 226.239, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "a little bit this is on hole 13 at augusta he's got a little ball above his feet just a little bit yeah that ball is probably almost probably three or four", "start": 234.799, "duration": 18.322}
{"chunk": "inches higher and you can't really tell from this this vantage point but what you can really see is when we zoom in on his grip we can see that his left hand the the", "start": 244.0, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "back of his left hand is basically pointed straight toward the target so his grip is pretty pretty weak in reality in the left hand", "start": 252.4, "duration": 15.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "and then he has more or less a neutral right he got a very solid stable wide base with his legs for sure", "start": 260.0, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "and so let's kind of move him through the motion here he makes a big wind up you can see the left bend at the top of his swing and the", "start": 268.0, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "extension is in his spine which is really cool and then you can really see as he changes directions this vantage point", "start": 275.919, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "gives you a really good idea of what his belt is doing you can see how it lowers down that first little bit yeah he gets that just that little bit", "start": 285.36, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "of stretch right in here he gets that little stretch right there and then it starts making his chest go so he's able to separate just a little bit his upper", "start": 293.199, "duration": 19.041000000000004}
{"chunk": "and lower body and then he starts around the corner now he really stays in the shot we've done a video on", "start": 302.4, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "head movement and swivel or something his eyes stay really this way he also doesn't deliver a lot of shaft lean he's one of the guys that leans at", "start": 311.919, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "less he's actually got the grip of the club pointed more back at his middle and what's hideki's ball flight pretty high really high but you know for a course", "start": 320.08, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "like augusta or some of these firmer golf courses that that can come in handy comes in yeah real handy nice so and this the shutter speed on this camera is", "start": 328.32, "duration": 17.040000000000003}
{"chunk": "not quite good enough to get the shaft it blurs but you can get the idea of what his body's doing there's there's that", "start": 336.8, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "what we really like to see and you can see his hands are still going up when that little change of direction happens and that's a real athletic", "start": 345.44, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "dynamic motion right there that i really love so pretty unique golf swing very functional very cool i think he was like one of the", "start": 354.72, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "top guys in scrambling that week so we didn't cover short game but you know that takes that around that golf course too but he's a phenomenal iron player", "start": 364.08, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "really really good iron player you can see that the radius how stable it is through the strike yeah there's not a lot of folding up of the arms his body keeps turning so he can", "start": 372.08, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "keep his arms along for a long time very cool it's a really cool golf swing all right let's move on to phil mickelson we'll zoom in a little bit on phil", "start": 380.56, "duration": 20.08}
{"chunk": "and let's watch this swing in full hitting speed that week so phil was bombing it i think he led the field in driving distance at the pga no", "start": 390.0, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "i think he did that's pretty cool for a guy who's almost 51 he oh he's swinging out of his shoes i love it he's got that 48 inch driver that's now illegal this one", "start": 400.0, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "looked more like one of his controlled swings though and it's probably a he did he have two drivers in the bag or did he just have one that week i can't remember actually that driver doesn't look 48", "start": 408.24, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "inches either yeah that might be one of those because he you can see even his footwork he's not coming out of it whereas like when he was really going after it he kind of moved out away from", "start": 417.039, "duration": 18.561999999999998}
{"chunk": "it he was jumping out of the way let's take a look at this action let's move through it slow so he's got a nice wide take away yeah", "start": 425.68, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "the one thing i really want to i like in the takeaway i point out is that his club kind of he kind of does like a little bit of a hover and moves a little off the ball a", "start": 434.88, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "little the club gets pressured down just a little bit just a little bit to keep the club out in front and he's as he's moving it away he's got it nice and wide", "start": 444.0, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "which i really like and then all that width goes away but it's better than it used to be yeah so he gets it up to the top", "start": 452.24, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "his left arm breaks down pretty good but you can see the club head peek out behind his right shoulder and his left wrist almost almost goes from flat to", "start": 461.44, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "slightly cupped slightly yeah it goes from pretty darn flat right there to slightly cupped and then in transition it cups a little more", "start": 469.759, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "and it gets pretty darn narrow and you can see as he's coming down the shaft is splitting as the point of his shoulder so it's more it's more narrow and steep", "start": 479.52, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "than most really good players but and his footwork is a little different his his front side kind of goes pops out a little bit yeah or his backside i", "start": 487.84, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "should say his trail side kind of pops out and makes him use his hands well and his face comes down more open not as maybe stronger", "start": 502.319, "duration": 16.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "square to the ark that we can't talk about but it's a little more open but one thing he does beautifully probably the best", "start": 510.4, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "of all time is knowing how to use his hands and he really keeps that trail wrist extension too he keeps it for a long time and then he really because of how open the face is he", "start": 518.24, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "really goes boom yeah exactly the right arm covers the left through here yeah which it's not my preference for driving for", "start": 526.88, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "accuracy but that week it worked good for phil and you can really see how the grip yeah the grip shows up right", "start": 536.16, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "there and it's like a lot of roll and flip but if you can hit bombs and find them", "start": 544.48, "duration": 16.442}
{"chunk": "you can play i've drawn in a couple lines just to see how phil does with his body motion so i got a line on his rear end and one on his head", "start": 554.32, "duration": 19.278999999999996}
{"chunk": "and you can see he's kind of his head kind of backs up a little bit because he's steep and that's kind of a telltale sign anybody whose shaft comes in steep generally the head's going to back up to", "start": 563.68, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "make space for that kind of similar a little bit to jack nicklaus later in his career he had a little bit of that going on yeah he did for sure", "start": 572.88, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "and the the footwork is got some similarities as well how is this hip kind of juts in instead of pushing the lead side", "start": 582.08, "duration": 18.478}
{"chunk": "more around yeah but it works when you have the greatest set of hands in the history of the game you can get away with a lot of stuff let's go look at the forward on okay now this", "start": 591.279, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "is a pretty cool angle milo we got a little close-up action yeah so you got us a little close up here and you can", "start": 600.959, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "i want to show everybody in slow motion how his face goes from pointing basically directly in front of him", "start": 608.72, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "so show us here henry we've got the face directly pointed out in front right and now as he goes through the golf ball so i'm going to show here on the camera", "start": 615.68, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "as he goes through the ball that face is squaring up it hits the ball and it stayed square for about two", "start": 625.68, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "inches all you need within a couple of within a foot you're looking at the back of the club that's so funny so it's there hits", "start": 633.519, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "the ball and then you're looking at the back faster than that right right there and he's another player that stays in the shot pretty good before eventually", "start": 641.839, "duration": 15.761000000000001}
{"chunk": "following the ball and coming out of it yeah when that's kind of required when you've got the face coming in yeah you've got to put the brakes on something if you", "start": 649.6, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "actually watch his his grip the handle it's actually not moving if you look if we could", "start": 657.519, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "see where the handle is through the ball that handle is not really moving at all it's kind of coming right as belt buckle and then belt buckle belt buckle yeah", "start": 666.0, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "just boom yep so that's an interesting pattern that phil has there i'll tell you what though i watched him hit a wedge shot in slow motion", "start": 673.839, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "maybe four or five years ago and i learned so much that's when i really started to focus more on this trail wrist was watching him hit a wedge shot because he his", "start": 682.16, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "right hands are sorry his left hand is more on top right and he hit this wedge shot and it was like this and he like really held on that angle as he turned through", "start": 690.959, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "pressures the shaft like this with his wedges he has a very stable release yeah he's the best wedge player maybe there is", "start": 699.92, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "he just can't his he hasn't figured out how to make speed with that pattern yeah which is why he uses the other one and", "start": 708.56, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "you know when he's on he's pretty darn good but when he's off he's off but that's one thing you could definitely learn from him is sort of", "start": 717.6, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "how great he is at manipulating just his hands all right having some good hand action he's got amazing hands but knowing that you can hit you can strike", "start": 725.36, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "something this way and also knowing that you can hit something higher that way yep all right uh milo now we're going to go on to uh john rom us open champion", "start": 733.44, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "torrey pines uh another asu grad so here we go phil mickelson to john ron seems like a nice little hand-off there", "start": 742.16, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "huh yeah back-to-back arizona state alums doing it now john rum i'm going to draw the same lines in on john so a little", "start": 750.72, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "backside line now this is probably the closest angle we've had to more ideal down the line it's getting really close to being a nice down the line angle", "start": 758.24, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "the camera's a little movie a little shaky out one of the fans you can see as as john takes it back his head actually moves out toward the ball", "start": 768.16, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "a little bit yeah his rear end stays back on the wall and his wrists work interesting look at that", "start": 776.16, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "that lead wrist how about the glove really bowed at the top short back swing but really driven hard by the body so", "start": 783.2, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "you can see as his hands are still going up his his pelvis and his torso beginning to unwind catches his arms", "start": 793.279, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "like that so he's catching his arms like and it creates a really a snap a real slingshot action into the ball so his his action is really more", "start": 800.959, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "the focus of it's really the through part would you say where basically his downswing is taking up more of the focus than the", "start": 811.12, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "backswing in a way yeah his his backswing is pretty short there's not a lot of it right so it's he's done by the time his hands get barely above", "start": 818.88, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "his shoulder high and he's changing directions hard and one thing to remember about john rum because i get asked this how does he hit", "start": 827.04, "duration": 15.199999999999998}
{"chunk": "it so far out of that short swing well how big is john wrong he's like what six four or something is that six three or six four like", "start": 834.639, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "two thirty or forty big legs big guy but he's also still got a lot of rotational power right yeah and he he uses the sequence so his hands are", "start": 841.839, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "working up and away his body starts to unwind hard and creates stretch shortened cycle that really unloads that club with a lot of speed", "start": 851.12, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "and he delivers a lot of lean in the shaft he's also a very good ball striker yep he's primarily plays a little bit of a fade", "start": 859.6, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "and most would consider him like the most consistent ball striker well he's number one on tour i think this last year so and you can see his pivot is one", "start": 868.079, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "that i really love so hideki was more of a jumper yep where if i put the same line on rom's belt", "start": 876.079, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "you can see he is level he doesn't jump at all he just pivots what's interesting with him though is that you'll see on the forward on when", "start": 885.519, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "we go to that is he has a he has a little bit of that roll over too though he's not exactly what we would say from extension to flexion with the wrist he's got a little", "start": 893.839, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "bit of this well you can really see it in the follow-through right here you can see his left hand is actually kind of on the hands go from back in", "start": 902.639, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "here shallow and then they kind of go up a little bit into the finish which doesn't matter a lot because he's perfectly planed out for like that", "start": 909.839, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "right there they they're perfect now what you don't what we don't know is what are some of john's restrictions why might that happen well john's got", "start": 918.56, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "a few different things that are off he's got a bad ankle so he doesn't have enough mobility his pivot probably stops so his arms go with", "start": 927.199, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "all that energy they go up yeah instead of continuing around that's that would be my guess as to why that happens but cool move let's look at it from face on", "start": 934.959, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "now so well he also talks about how his wrists don't go into extension a lot so i wonder like you know you see a lot of these guys they swing and their their", "start": 944.399, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "wrist kind of re-hinges re-cops and his goes this way his probably stays bowed and goes up plus his grip we're going to look at that now yeah that's part of it", "start": 953.04, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "this is more like somewhat down the target line here yeah i threw you a curveball you did so i don't get a look at john's grip well we can look at the glove though a", "start": 961.92, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "little bit here a little but i can tell you from watching john in person a few times his grip looks like yeah it's maybe even", "start": 970.959, "duration": 15.199999999999998}
{"chunk": "a little more turned this way and you're saying i think you've told me before his right hand isn't it's not super weak his right hand is", "start": 978.959, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "neutral to strong actually yeah so it's more side on maybe even slightly under yeah but his left hand is super weak it's like", "start": 986.079, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "weaker than that i don't know if i can go that week like that now you got close to john but you can see how if this hinges it would bow that", "start": 995.12, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "yeah and that's why his does that and like we've talked about before he's gonna his impact's gonna look more like that whereas a guy like fleetwood or you", "start": 1003.44, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "yep there's gonna be more like that exactly well let's look at this this is a cool angle you got here so this is kind of like a 45 degree", "start": 1011.44, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "angle out oh we got a car ad oh thanks for the advertisement but here you can really see that sequence hands going up", "start": 1019.199, "duration": 19.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "belt going around excuse me that's a cool motion there that hands going up belt going around", "start": 1028.64, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "you can really see the right bend right there yeah and you can see how for a guy who doesn't have a lot of ability to extend", "start": 1041.52, "duration": 16.078999999999997}
{"chunk": "his trail wrist it's pretty extended so under torque it can when there's a lot of right because he torques it hard when he changes directions you know the way that", "start": 1049.28, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "i put your hands together and you're like okay i can extend my right and match with my left or i can bow my left and match with my right i mean either way that trail", "start": 1057.44, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "wrist is getting extended yeah so it's kind of we focus on the trail wrist a lot because that's most people's dominant hands yeah we feel that a little bit", "start": 1066.4, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "better we're righties so this is that little rollover move i talked about where you know you look at a guy like more cowa he might have a", "start": 1075.36, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "little bit more face stinks square to the ark whereas roms is a little more in line with fills yep but it's a little different than feels because it's so much more stable", "start": 1083.679, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "through the hitting area it hasn't started to roll over and it doesn't roll over at all until it watch what makes it roll over see his right elbow when his", "start": 1092.48, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "right elbow hits the full extension yeah now watch it go now that's partly you said too because there's rotation at this point is starting to stall he rotated so far so", "start": 1100.08, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "early then now he's done he hit a wall and now you'll see that roll over and ride up and you can see as he goes through it kind of like matt", "start": 1110.16, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "wolf's release actually a lot of a lot of that with the left hand and the right hand and he's he's definitely staying in the shot again", "start": 1118.559, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "for sure so his head stays down for a long time but it doesn't take forever definitely", "start": 1127.6, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "i'm going through a little bit of that too right because his weak grip he talked about the left elbow pointing down to the ground sort of yeah but at contact hogan's elbow pointing at the target right but i'm", "start": 1137.36, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "talking about in the release point he had some supination through right it's a little similar to that both grips but hogan's release went left", "start": 1146.08, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "lower yeah this one goes more up but i doubt rom's clubs were six degrees flat no i wouldn't work with a guy who's six foot four", "start": 1153.12, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "so that's a cool move love it all right milo the last major of the year was the open championship colin moricawa", "start": 1162.64, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "probably one of the i would say best swings on tour most stable faced one of them which creates very good iron shots from i've talked to the guys over", "start": 1171.76, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "at taylormade and they say it's freakish watching him hit irons it's like he's a laser beam yeah over and over again now one interesting", "start": 1181.2, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "thing while we were off camera we were both commenting on we had four guys win majors this year who all have slightly weak grips yeah or", "start": 1189.28, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "in the case of rom and morikawa extremely weak left hands yeah but all their right none of their right hands are weak", "start": 1197.12, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "really well let's take a look at this this action here so as he hinges you can see that pretty much immediately starts to bow that left", "start": 1205.36, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "wrist by time he gets the top of his swing it's a little boat and then in transition when his pelvis starts to unwind you can see", "start": 1213.679, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "that pelvis unwinding it puts a lot of hinge on that right wrist which flexes the left one even more so he says", "start": 1220.64, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "boom and then that the weight of that golf club counteracting it hinges that and flexes that which is an interesting motion", "start": 1229.919, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "and then he has a lot of side bend i think that that will change over the course of his career he's not going to", "start": 1239.919, "duration": 15.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "be able to stay gumby forever [Music] but he's got more side bend than most his pelvis is", "start": 1247.52, "duration": 15.5}
{"chunk": "basically pointing at the target like look at that it's amazing he's like his belt line's got to be 70 degrees open well as you've told me", "start": 1255.28, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "before it's pretty good for face stability too oh it is and you watch if we could see the face here which is hard to see but you can really see that the", "start": 1264.88, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "the grip end is exiting before the the club head end and when you watch his swing too and that club face come through his face", "start": 1272.559, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "it's more square to the ark or even a little skyward than rom or phil and phil have a lot more throw after they hit it where he's much more stable", "start": 1281.76, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "this way and his release pattern is more than oh yeah you're going to see that in the forward on not this direction yeah which you know can we go back to the", "start": 1290.88, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "takeaway real quick and one thing a lot of people get i think a little they over analyze it a little bit and try to work on it too", "start": 1298.799, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "much is sort of getting this club out in front of them right they kind of they're trying to get the club to work out in front of them a lot so", "start": 1306.559, "duration": 15.841999999999999}
{"chunk": "then they can sort of loop it back shallow it but my thing is like you watch his hands they're not going out they're staying in and the club stays out his hands are", "start": 1314.72, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "going in he's kind of putting a little natural pressure down on the grip which levers the club up like most of them i guarantee you if we", "start": 1323.36, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "had his 3d motion capture you'd see that it's mostly driven by the torso rotation so when his chest starts to rotate", "start": 1333.44, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "that makes the club work like that right and he's just turning on a nice plane well there's a lot of guys too that played really good golf with that club", "start": 1341.44, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "not working as far out as that yeah well there have been guys who worked it in and played pretty darn good sam snead was pretty good ben hogan worked it more in he was okay they're", "start": 1349.28, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "okay yeah just decent cool all right let's go look at the forward on face on oh you gave me another interesting angle", "start": 1358.559, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "i'm challenging you milo oh i love all the angles these different angles are cool though this is one of my favorite angles honestly i'd love to see this because you can actually really see i'm", "start": 1368.559, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "going to draw some lines through here so this is kind of like 45 between the ball and the target you can really see that his spine is curved", "start": 1376.96, "duration": 18.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "so there's a left bend and it's happening and i'm going to draw in shoulder plane and belt line so you can see the belt is on", "start": 1386.24, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "that plane shoulders are on a much steeper plane which i love to see because that's a little", "start": 1394.4, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "bit of bend in that spine now let's delete those and watch how this change of directions work look at that action huh another awesome one where you", "start": 1401.84, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "can see that left side of the pelvis starts going i think his is way more dramatic than hideki's though even more earlier well he's more that's why he's", "start": 1409.679, "duration": 19.041000000000004}
{"chunk": "more gumby so when he changes directions yeah he can stretch that i can't do that you can do it more than i can when i do that my chest goes but", "start": 1419.36, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "believe it or not he works out a lot too yeah all these guys you know i know he's kind of a yeah but he's like 140 150 not as big as rahm and hideki but he he", "start": 1428.32, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "works out a lot too he definitely does but that's a cool transition move hands still going up that pelvis going back and around", "start": 1437.679, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "catches everything and starts it all going the other way so it's a little bit of a fall too fall into that lead side for sure you can see his foot even kind of", "start": 1445.919, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "just a little bit of a heel lift and raise there yeah his heel lifts actually as he's falling left that's interesting that's like tap dancing yeah", "start": 1454.64, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "so it's almost like he unweights his front foot but look at this yardage book in his back left pocket look how far it moves before the club has even come down", "start": 1463.36, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "to like p5 before his left arm comes to parallel that that yards books gone out of the screen oh yeah that thing goes around he is", "start": 1471.279, "duration": 16.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "he's a good mover and he's wiry so he can he's very flexible so by the time he gets down into the hitting area you can see his his belt is", "start": 1479.52, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "pointing darn near at the target yep look at his left foot starting to roll over onto the the outside arch he hasn't even hit this", "start": 1488.559, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "ball yet he's still a foot away from hitting it and he's he's already on the outside edge of his foot up onto the ball of his or even the toe", "start": 1496.32, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "of his right foot and his chest you can see how open his chest is his chest is around the corner so that's a pretty cool move", "start": 1504.0, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "i would say his head is coming out of the shot a little bit sooner than some of the other guys yeah it goes with the golf club as the club goes through the ball the club the head goes with it yeah", "start": 1512.48, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "so we might actually be able to ask him which eye is your dominant eye because most guys and it kind of lines up you see the guys who really keep their head in it yeah a lot", "start": 1521.6, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "of times they're left eye dominant well i would say the guys that tend to keep their head in it too tend to have maybe a little more face roll through release whereas the guys are opening up face", "start": 1530.559, "duration": 18.561999999999998}
{"chunk": "might stay a little more stable look or appearing right yeah it doesn't really matter that once you're beyond the foot by past the ball yeah whatever happens", "start": 1539.6, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "happens who cares yeah but it definitely if you stay here it stalls out your chest a little bit and makes this roll over a little bit more so the guys that tend to let their head", "start": 1547.2, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "go can maintain this a lot longer yeah cool is that all our major champions all of them i gave you", "start": 1556.72, "duration": 17.118000000000002}
{"chunk": "some interesting angles and you know well i think between more cow and rom we've got two guys who are going to be up there for years and years so", "start": 1564.559, "duration": 17.201}
