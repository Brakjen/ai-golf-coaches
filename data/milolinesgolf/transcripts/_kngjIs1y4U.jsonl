{"chunk": "um but it's more than just that when we catch the ball low on the face what we're doing is is we're compressing the golf ball the the golf ball is coming", "start": 53.199, "duration": 17.161}

{"chunk": "strikes okay and then I want you to give me a club that is sure not to help me hit any tiger strikes I can do that I can do my best to do that all right yeah I would say I'm going to have you hit", "start": 680.24, "duration": 16.681}
