{"chunk": "if you get this way it's going to tend to create too much of a swipe across so after making the change and getting my my setup correct I was able to go back", "start": 208.44, "duration": 16.261}

{"chunk": "Flag or those two tall trees in front of a clubhouse so this line is actually parallel to that line so it's basically", "start": 313.56, "duration": 15.48}

{"chunk": "for height and then I like it if I'm set up here I like it more or less shooting through my forearms so right on that", "start": 356.22, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "line down the target line yeah so roughly this alignment stick we have on the ground that alignment sticks pretty darn close right it's so maybe just", "start": 364.02, "duration": 16.078999999999997}

{"chunk": "call it so it's down the that forearm that wrist bone yep shooting right through the hand line basically toward the target and that's going to give us a nice look sort of up the swing plane on", "start": 407.1, "duration": 18.899}
{"chunk": "both sides so generally that gives you the least amount of distortion because camera distort and wherever you put it", "start": 417.06, "duration": 16.921}

{"chunk": "here if I crisscross this guy and that's going to run ideally somewhere right through the lens so it's", "start": 473.52, "duration": 16.56}
