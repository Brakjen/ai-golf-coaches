{"chunk": "lead side in the golf swing and i believe this comes from a question from youtube right yep", "start": 9.2, "duration": 15.161}
{"chunk": "[Music] okay so henry we get to the top of our backswing our", "start": 16.2, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "trail leg is kind of extended our lead leg is kind of a little more flexed we want to go immediately to straightening it out right", "start": 24.32, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "yeah we want to lock it out feel like we're jumping like this well that's right i mean for how long have we been told to", "start": 32.32, "duration": 15.918999999999999}
{"chunk": "straighten your left leg and post up on your lead side right for a long time a long time but", "start": 41.2, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "when when does that happen and how does it happen yeah or does it really happen or maybe is it just not to the extent we think it", "start": 48.8, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "is um let's get into it yeah okay so this is what's actually happening i", "start": 57.6, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "reached the top of my backswing and yes my trail leg has lost some flex hopefully yes my lead leg has gained some flex now as i", "start": 66.08, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "as i train as i transition and i change directions both legs are actually gaining flex or at least my lead legs not losing it", "start": 74.64, "duration": 18.159000000000002}
{"chunk": "right away so i get back to square and my knees are both pretty flexed right and ideally this left knee is going external so it goes not going like", "start": 83.759, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "back and straightening it's not doing this it's going like this right so it's externally rotating some amount", "start": 93.92, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "as my left hip is rotating around in reality my left leg is internally rotating relative to my", "start": 101.68, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "left hip but my knee is moving around externally yes now what makes that leg straighten out am i", "start": 110.479, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "just straightening the leg out trying to lock it or is it the fact that my pelvis is moving around and around", "start": 120.56, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "and around look at my legs straight now right and this this foot then starts to kind of reset and open back", "start": 128.08, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "up right so it lands together this goes around and if i keep going this wood actually will go back that way", "start": 135.68, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "some amount yeah so what's really happening is the middle of my body is opening up and that's causing this leg", "start": 144.959, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "to look like it's straightening out yeah you get this sort of straight line appearance we talked about this on the soccer video too actually a little bit yeah so your knee still has a little", "start": 153.36, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "flex to it yes some players will run into almost a locked out left leg but it usually will happen extending that usually is happening", "start": 162.319, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "after they've hit the golf ball hopefully if it's hyper extended before i get there then my body is literally stopped so", "start": 170.56, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "there probably are some players we could look at and say yes they do do that but they probably have a little bit more of a flip through the ball because their rotation is", "start": 178.159, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "coming to well and most of them probably jump too to some extent right yeah so they're because their feet are almost off the ground", "start": 185.92, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "they're not really putting as much torque i guess on that leg yeah so that would be that'd be like your justin thomas your bubba watson", "start": 193.92, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "right yeah they've actually kind of jumped in the air a little bit yeah like this so when that leg ex hyper extends there's not quite as much", "start": 209.68, "duration": 15.598999999999998}
{"chunk": "pressure in it yeah as if i hyperextended it and try to turn right and i'm on the ground staying planted and straightening the left leg", "start": 217.68, "duration": 19.761}
{"chunk": "probably not a good match-up no so my preference though would be to see the pelvis moving kind of in a down and around", "start": 226.48, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "and keep moving around and then it naturally starts to extend up over on this side and then you get that and then i get this straight line", "start": 235.519, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "i really don't want to see that straightening out too soon which is i would say is a really common issue you see a lot of players", "start": 243.84, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "pelvis sliding left leg straightening and they get into this kind of a position yeah now i'm in a straight line condition but i'm", "start": 251.92, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "not rotated enough and i'm not to the ball yet so i'd rather see that straight line condition happen about there yeah so a little later in the golf", "start": 261.519, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "swing it's happening a little later and it's happening because of the rotation not because you're just straightening the leg out right so if you're thinking about", "start": 271.759, "duration": 18.162}
{"chunk": "posting up on the lead side or straightening your left leg a lot of you might be doing it too early in the golf swing where you're trying to", "start": 280.24, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "do it as you're pulling down so it's kind of those kind of run hand in hand i feel like sometimes they're trying to rotate and they're like well i need to", "start": 289.12, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "straighten my left leg so they rotate from the top and then they straighten their left leg and then they kind of get stuck on the right side a lot of things go wrong from", "start": 298.08, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "there when the rotation stop when that left leg hits a wall the rotation is stopped it's just like when i'm swinging the golf club when when my right arm my right elbow hits a", "start": 307.039, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "wall the acceleration of the handle has stopped the club flips yeah so if this straightens out my body stops the club's gonna flip", "start": 315.68, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "right so that's why as you are showing the first move it's getting into the ground this left knee is going more external", "start": 324.24, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "and then from there you can start to kind of unwind so we've gotta start opening up as we're kind of compressing into the ground", "start": 333.12, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "that allows the rotation to continue for a lot longer if i'm opening up and straightening out the rotation stops too soon that's basically what it all boils down", "start": 341.52, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "to so we want to make sure the rotation can keep going long enough to carry us all the way through the ball now just quickly too at the finish do", "start": 349.919, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "that straight line for me again notice too his upper body isn't way over here as he's posted up no no it should be basically a straight", "start": 357.28, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "line from my left ankle up to my left pec right something like belt buckles pretty much almost the most forward thing yeah right the belt buckle my actually", "start": 367.199, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "the most forward thing is probably my ankle okay and then next is my belt buckle or my my left leg yeah i really just don't", "start": 376.319, "duration": 17.041999999999998}
{"chunk": "want to see this left leg looking like this right once we start getting there there are players who do it yeah but i'm putting a lot of stress right here on my low back", "start": 384.88, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "so i would much rather see this kind of a look where my from my leg up to my left pec is just one straight line not a lot of arch in the back", "start": 393.28, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "it's pretty easy on you yeah all right well cool i think that sort of sums up what we've been talking about with the posting up on the lead side how to do it", "start": 402.639, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "correctly and efficiently now i got to show everybody how to do it yeah yeah let's let's see a video is not a video if i don't get to hit one you're going to do it from the top right you're just going", "start": 411.84, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "to straight i'm going to straighten it out and swing it like that no we're going to do it my way hold that finish for me there you go", "start": 420.56, "duration": 20.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "so you see his foot's kind of opened up here lead sides got that straight line and you've maintained some of that that's tilt too that you have", "start": 433.28, "duration": 17.438}
