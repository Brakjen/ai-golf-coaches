{"chunk": "just go for the hybrid and sometimes i can get that out there pretty good anyway so so off a t what i found let me aim a little more", "start": 321.6, "duration": 16.64}

{"chunk": "with the setup the club being a little more at my left arm not as much loft look to it even the the handle wasn't quite as low", "start": 338.639, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "as a little more here the only thing i changed was i actually hovered it like i do with my driver sweet that's a simple setup adjustment just", "start": 347.28, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "barely above the tops of the grass yeah let's see how it works because i like that little hover field driver", "start": 356.56, "duration": 15.439999999999998}

{"chunk": "a little shaft lean you know because again with driver even with driver we want a little shaft lane coming into it right so", "start": 404.72, "duration": 18.56}

{"chunk": "you know i can come in a little bit more level or slightly down okay she's going a little more right but that was okay", "start": 423.44, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "still pretty good okay so here's the moral of the story here for those at home don't set up and try to add loft and", "start": 438.0, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "help that darn three wood in the air it doesn't make it better set up hit it a little closer to how you'd hit an iron a long iron something along", "start": 445.84, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "those lines right so we're not leaning the shaft back and trying to hit that thing up and hit five would hit five would more often you hit three", "start": 454.8, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "wood because it's easier to do now a lot of people even the tour guides are going to seven woods now so that's another great club to have in your bag", "start": 463.84, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "if you don't already if you're not hitting driver 250 carry how you don't have a seven one i don't know like to me that should be an", "start": 471.36, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "automatic club in your bag well there's there's an interesting thing here there's a reason you're hitting the three wood and i'm not hitting the three wood right now", "start": 479.84, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "my bag doesn't have one yeah you have a five wood i have a five what is my longest other than my driver just", "start": 488.72, "duration": 15.6}

{"chunk": "it shorter and so the three wood goes too close to the same distance as the driver for me so i just like that i like the five wood yeah sometimes this thing comes off i", "start": 506.639, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "mean like that one you saw it came out like a missile right so and these only have like this one has 14 and a half degrees of loft", "start": 514.479, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "you know so it's i mean 30 years ago that was close to a driver wasn't it probably a driver", "start": 522.479, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "and it's longer now too yeah that's as long as the drivers when i first learned how to play golf with persimmon i think my drive i don't know the exact", "start": 530.64, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "loft on my driver but i know the length it was 43.5 inches which is probably the same as that yep so get your club fit as well but anyways hopefully that gave you", "start": 539.04, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "guys a clear indication of how we want to be able to almost hit down a little bit with this three wood not because we're swinging down but because", "start": 548.32, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "we we're hitting it like an iron yeah essentially or a longer iron yeah you're not scooping it up yeah and trevino was great about that he talked a lot about", "start": 557.279, "duration": 15.921}
