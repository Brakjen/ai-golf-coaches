{"chunk": "welcome back out to superstition mountain we're talking masters this week though and we're going to be talking specifically today about green reading", "start": 0.32, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "and big sloping putts something you would see at augusta national right some of the craziest greens they face all year [Music]", "start": 9.44, "duration": 19.689999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah you don't see many flat putts there nothing straight and they're fast very fast probably the fastest on on tour that year so", "start": 21.359, "duration": 18.322}
{"chunk": "um so milo i you know we got our ball here we're gonna be putting down to this this cup here okay so walk us through your process and when", "start": 30.16, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "it starts as well so my process for this putt doesn't start when i get to the green it", "start": 40.079, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "starts as i'm walking in so as i'm walking into the green depending on the angle i'm walking in at i'm i'm watching to see what my ball did when it landed", "start": 48.719, "duration": 18.002}
{"chunk": "and i'm looking for slopes and looking for just basic drainage where's the where's the water running off this hole are you looking for a raised creek or", "start": 57.68, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "maybe if i'm at augusta i am so everything breaks to race creek right that's what they say so that must be the low point on the golf course yeah so you're just", "start": 65.519, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "basically looking for low points where the water is going to flow because the ball is going to want to go where the water goes yeah no i think that's", "start": 74.4, "duration": 18.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "such an important concept is start your green reading process it saves time too but start it as you're you're walking up to the green and a lot of times your", "start": 82.96, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "best read is the first one that you see as you're walking in in my experience yeah sometimes i'll see it as i'm walking in and i know exactly you know i'm looking at this and i'm", "start": 92.72, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "thinking okay this putt looks like it breaks about that much but if i walk around and analyze it i might change my mind right but usually that first instinct", "start": 101.36, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "was probably pretty close yeah so on a putt like this one another thing i like to look at it from the low side yeah", "start": 112.079, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "so i'll walk in here and i'll take a picture of it in my mind and just look at kind of where i need to arch it and then i you know if i was in a", "start": 120.399, "duration": 15.762}
{"chunk": "tournament i'd look at it from this side as well and i'm going to get a picture of where that ball is going to come into the hole from", "start": 128.8, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "so that ball is going to be coming out in here and it's going to come into the hole this way yep fairly sideways now one one", "start": 138.239, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "thing i also do is i kind of walk the whole putt unless it's pretty flat but this one obviously isn't i might actually walk the high side just to visualize it okay", "start": 146.239, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "here's my ball it's tracing here it's going to be coming in you know let's say three four o'clock here on this cup so you just walk a circle around it yeah", "start": 154.959, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "and you know one of the guys that's done probably the best putting wise augusta is jordan spieth and he talks about this is sort of seeing", "start": 163.92, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "walking the high line and visualizing it falling in so he can really feel how much break it is yeah and so on fast greens like that i'm always looking for them", "start": 171.44, "duration": 16.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "what's the highest line i could possibly take so kind of the apex you want to find where that apex is right yeah because i'm looking to make that ball go into the hole slow and", "start": 179.84, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "use as much brake as i can yeah i don't want this putt to be i don't want to take break out of it and make it take a beeline to the hole because if i happen to do that and i", "start": 187.68, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "miss goodbye i might be pitching back from somewhere so i really want to just see it dying i want to see it dying in perfect speed", "start": 196.56, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "okay okay so let's see how i can do on this one so i'm looking i'm seeing this putt going out in here and running kind of through this and", "start": 204.72, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "this way so you're kind of doing you're kind of seeing the apex like up in here maybe yep so let's see i'm gonna try to hit it and", "start": 213.599, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "so i see every kind of straight so if i draw a straight line kind of through that it's actually slightly outside of that apex point", "start": 222.64, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "my straight line point is kind of yeah i'm going to hit it straight at that see how we did here maybe a touch on the slower side than", "start": 230.64, "duration": 17.122}
{"chunk": "augusta but they're not as fast as they normally are that's pretty good my read was good yup my speed was not so good", "start": 244.959, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "i think our line in this old cup was about right yeah so we're hitting on that line i just need to give it a little bit more", "start": 253.36, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "speed to get it there come on now do it oh you little dog pretty good putt though i would not cry if i rolled that ball", "start": 260.639, "duration": 15.363000000000001}
{"chunk": "over there to that with that much break yeah all right well let's take a look at left or righters and see if anything changes with that as well okay okay", "start": 271.04, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "so now we've got a little left to right putt it's actually a fairly large left to right putt it's about what a 17 footer", "start": 280.32, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "but it's probably gonna break four feet yeah at least a few yeah so when the greens are fast this putt breaks a lot like eight feet yeah so where would you", "start": 287.52, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "see this ball going in um i see it going in like right through here yeah but i see it apexing like i need to", "start": 297.919, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "hit almost through this old hole what i see coming in at eight o'clock", "start": 306.8, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "and going through here about yeah so let's see let's see how that read is i'm gonna just try to hit it right there", "start": 314.32, "duration": 21.68}
{"chunk": "i hit the hair firm actually i didn't hit it here firm the greens are just a hair slow it might be like right here but that was pretty good yeah it was a good putt", "start": 328.479, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "so you can really see that putt snapped late but it was good speed to allow it to die in yeah and i crushed it", "start": 338.08, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "that's what you get at augusta if you didn't want a little firm that wouldn't have been very good", "start": 353.919, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "i crushed that putt break you dog that's one of the hardest", "start": 357.919, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "things i would say with these big breaking putts is matching the speed in the line well that's basically the key it's", "start": 369.919, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "they're very difficult to make because i could make it on a ton of different lines as long as i match speed right right", "start": 378.319, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "so there's a lot of ways to make it so on these putts i'm always trying to see the most how big a break can i play and how how slow can i hit", "start": 386.8, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "it and get it to go in yep now this green is bermuda it's not that fast currently so it's not scary", "start": 394.0, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "but if it was if this was like like it was a month ago when this thing was still dormant and fast you'd have to just tickle that puck yeah these greens were like four feet faster", "start": 402.639, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "like a month ago yeah they were like 13. they were like augusta they were good stuff but now this thing's only rolling like 10", "start": 411.919, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "so now it's not scary anymore so i can take a little more of a direct line and it doesn't break as much as i keep seeing i see that thing going a lot more to the right and", "start": 418.72, "duration": 16.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "yeah i need to go those last two are about good speed i'll put you a little inside the cup this time", "start": 427.599, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "i figured it out it's a lot lower because they're not fast yeah so greens that are faster also break a lot more", "start": 439.52, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "because gravity gets to act on that ball a lot longer because the thing rolls forever well we saw in the right to left one how much it it really was that was downhill so it's a lot faster", "start": 447.12, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "putt yeah this doesn't really get downhill until maybe the last until it turns and starts going down right so but generally i see most people miss the", "start": 456.0, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "left to right putts to the right yeah most righties at least because it it's hard to it's hard to play the ball far enough out to the left for some reason when", "start": 464.72, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "you're when you're right-handed and some of it could be the way that we're set up the slope kind of pulls us down yeah i it's a it's a problem i see a lot", "start": 472.72, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "and i i've you know i've struggled with it too one thing i i sometimes feel is you know you've probably heard you can have a little more weight in your left side", "start": 482.08, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "i also feel like i get my weight kind of in the heels just so i i get my my body and the putter head", "start": 489.759, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "essentially on a level lie i'm no longer on this sloped lie and that just helps me feel like now i'm just putting on a level lie right so", "start": 497.36, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "sometimes that can help me too if i'm on a really severe slope so i'm not like you know falling down the hill getting on my toes for sure but putting in augusta is going to be a", "start": 506.96, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "lot of fun to watch and it's going to make all the difference the person that wins this week will probably putt really well they usually do it's hard to find a guy who wins who", "start": 515.76, "duration": 18.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "doesn't pretty much make everything at good lag speed dying it in very rarely three putting and they make the ones that they're supposed", "start": 524.64, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "to make and you know don't miss don't screw up any of the other ones yeah awesome well if you like this video please subscribe hit the bell icon so", "start": 532.56, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
