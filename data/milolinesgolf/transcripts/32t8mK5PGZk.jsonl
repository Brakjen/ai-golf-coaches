{"chunk": "[Music] let's take a look at daniel burger's golf swing so here we have daniel berger's golf swing first thing i want you to notice is the strength of his", "start": 30.07, "duration": 15.778}
{"chunk": "left hand grip it's a four knuckle grip it looks pretty conventional pivot wise as he takes it at the top he's got the right tilts and turns", "start": 46.399, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "everything looks really pretty much mint as he comes down you know this is pretty awesome motion", "start": 55.52, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "with that grip he matches it up really good returns it just where it started pretty awesome move very nice looking from", "start": 63.44, "duration": 18.718}
{"chunk": "that vantage point now from down the line you can see it looks really conventional as he starts to club back but from the halfway back point to the", "start": 72.799, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "top of his backswing he begins to supinate his trail forearm which normally happens in the downswing but he's got it preset so now with his", "start": 82.08, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "awesome pivot he's able to deliver that club to the ball really stably okay now that we've looked at daniel's swing you can see there's some really", "start": 90.88, "duration": 18.238}
{"chunk": "interesting things going on there now what i want to show you is how those things all match up and work so henry's going to", "start": 101.6, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "pretend he's daniel for a minute it's going to be tough because he doesn't move like henry but some of the things he does we can we can all emulate so", "start": 109.04, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "first thing i want to point out is daniel berger gets the he gets the club face in a really good spot his ba hit the early part of his backswing is pretty much mint right it", "start": 118.32, "duration": 17.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "looks just like i would draw it up so from address to first parallel here it looks just", "start": 128.239, "duration": 16.002}
{"chunk": "like this the club's right in his hands it's beautiful and then from there on what does this club do well he gets it his lead hand pretty", "start": 135.84, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "laid off here he gets the club pretty far behind him and his hands way high and this is really supinated so his", "start": 144.48, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "his trail wrist is really rotated this way okay now what do we all know about the golf swing that needs to supinate at some point in the", "start": 153.76, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "swing right daniel just does it in the back swing so he doesn't do it like my normal would be go go to a normal top of backswing position", "start": 161.92, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "henry so we're pretty much everything in line now go ahead and start down and have this little supination move where the club shallows out and gets where we want it", "start": 170.08, "duration": 17.358}
{"chunk": "well so now you've got it in that shallow position now swing that up to the top does that feel kind of like what burger's done not quite this is even more out", "start": 178.959, "duration": 17.200999999999997}
{"chunk": "there shallow it like crazy so start at the at the top and give me a real shallow move there you go so you're really shallow that's what burger's got at the top yeah", "start": 187.44, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "so he's basically pre-ship set the shallowing move he's created he's got the all the supination and wrist conditions all preset", "start": 195.44, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "so as he's got this laid off high hands position at the top his right forearm is pre-supinated very extended trail", "start": 204.159, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "wrist yep from here you're saying it's a pivot and the arms just work kind of down yep they reconnect to him and yep", "start": 214.08, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "and then from here it's like any other pro you would see now most of us if we did that what would happen if we tried to preset everything if we", "start": 221.92, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "had everything preset we'd probably pull down and get steep we'd get steep but daniel doesn't so when he changes directions what happens to that shaft", "start": 230.4, "duration": 17.598}
{"chunk": "it what i noticed in his swing is it i felt like his arms almost just kind of rode down his arms right down his body opens up", "start": 238.879, "duration": 15.040999999999999}
{"chunk": "great he's got an awesome pivot and the club doesn't actually steepen it stays the same so it stays about how how laid off it is all the way down yeah", "start": 246.879, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "and he just turns the corner with it with a really passive stable face and strikes the ball really good one thing i loved when i was watching", "start": 255.2, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "him this past weekend was his patience from the top too yeah once he said it and he had that little movement down", "start": 262.96, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "he just absolutely could go after it yeah and his motion is not going to be the most dynamic way to do it because it's not", "start": 271.36, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "happening in transition it's all preset yep but it's pretty good pretty good for him he hits it real straight yeah i mean it definitely showed up on", "start": 278.639, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "18 when he needed it so awesome so is daniel burger's a golf swing we want to copy", "start": 287.04, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "probably not but there are things about his golf swing that i think everybody can copy well it's like dj when he was growing up why would you change his swing", "start": 294.639, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "a lot of people may have yeah but thankfully no one did burger being in the same boat right for sure that unique move", "start": 302.4, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "but they get it in that great spot and from here to here it's magic so if we're going to copy anything daniel berger does we're going to copy his pivot he has got", "start": 310.24, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "an awesome pivot and from waist high to waist high in the golf swing he's about as good as it gets so i would say that's what you want to", "start": 320.0, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "look at don't copy his wrist conditions at the top he does some interesting things kind of like dustin johnson does it's a little different but some", "start": 327.6, "duration": 16.56}
