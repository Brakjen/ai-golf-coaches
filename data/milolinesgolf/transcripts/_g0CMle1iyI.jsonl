{"chunk": "about your belt buckle oh yeah anthony kim back in the day we need one of those big ones right", "start": 7.839, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "yeah so what's the video today what are we talking about henry so we're going to talk about how i mean we're going to talk about the", "start": 20.16, "duration": 19.598}
{"chunk": "belt buckle but how the belt buckle you want to get pointed down in transition and then around through", "start": 29.039, "duration": 16.562}
{"chunk": "impact versus up and out right yes because this is a move we see all the time and really one of the biggest issues we see amongst", "start": 38.16, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "population of golfers and this is something i struggle with sometimes too is sort of that early extension thrust we call it goat humping whatever", "start": 47.28, "duration": 17.839999999999996}
{"chunk": "you want to call it but basically that belt buckle starts pointing out so if i had a if i had a laser beam pointing straight out of my belt here as i turned to the", "start": 56.16, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "top of my backswing you can see the direction that that would be in now as we change directions what we see with most golfers is this", "start": 65.6, "duration": 17.918}
{"chunk": "starts to go more up oh yeah what do we see with those that play on tour or really high", "start": 75.119, "duration": 15.282}
{"chunk": "level players generally well we see it work more level or slightly even down and pointed back at the ball in transition yeah so", "start": 82.24, "duration": 17.278999999999996}
{"chunk": "for most of the the really top-level ball strikers as they change direction you can see how that aimed more down", "start": 90.799, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "yeah so that's what we're talking about today we're trying to get that belt buckle in", "start": 99.439, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "transition to feel like it aims more down as it starts to go around now i'm going to make an assumption here", "start": 105.84, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "that most of our view viewers have probably seen that old tiger woods clip with butch harmon talking about this", "start": 115.28, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "olay move right yes similar spinning out a little bit and getting but it's also getting early extended", "start": 122.479, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "tilted yeah so that's a question i get a lot what is a spin out yes people hear me talk about how we want to get rotation started early", "start": 130.56, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "what's the difference in rotation started early in a spin out well a spin out would be me firing my hips up and forward like that", "start": 140.64, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "where this belt buckle immediately starts to go up then what happens the club falls behind us and now we've got to go", "start": 149.12, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "catch it up with our hands and hold that olay yeah you see a lot with little kids so what we're trying to get is kind of", "start": 158.4, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "the opposite there it's not that we're not turning my my belt buckle is definitely rotating but it's not firing in that way right so a lot of you", "start": 166.48, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "at home the first move in transition is sort of you're trying to get in the ground but really what's going on is you're going you're pushing up out of the ground early right", "start": 175.599, "duration": 20.32}
{"chunk": "instead of sort of falling into the ground calling this the squad a lot of people say right and get this belt buckle pointed back at", "start": 186.0, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "the ball yeah so what's really happened is we're i call it reflexing into the ground so at address we're kind of in in a flexed position knees flexed", "start": 194.959, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "our bodies kind of rounded off flexed as we swing back our spines extend now we've we've got to go back into", "start": 204.48, "duration": 15.999999999999998}
{"chunk": "flexion that's how we create force into the into the ground okay okay very cool so yeah what would be a practice we can do to", "start": 213.12, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "get our viewers at home feeling that something that i like to use i like to use alignment sticks so you can just slide that through your belt henry", "start": 222.4, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "okay we got it now slide it almost all the way through so it's mostly on this side okay now make a make a backswing for us", "start": 234.4, "duration": 18.078}
{"chunk": "now as you change directions the goal is to get this tip to look like it goes down and around yeah like that we don't want the tip", "start": 245.68, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "show us the wrong way so if you did the olay fire your hips well i don't want to stab you mine you can't reach me here so you can see the stick immediately", "start": 255.12, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "starts going up before it starts going and it never really goes around right so when when you fire your hips up and forward they don't open very well", "start": 263.44, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "they don't get nearly as open so down and around helps you get them open there you go so show us from down the line what that looks like", "start": 272.08, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "you want the bad one see the bad one that goes up in front of you now show us the good one there we go so see how that goes around", "start": 280.16, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "right so you can still rotate with that first move and that would be more your spin out so be kind like that but this is still", "start": 288.0, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "moving back up and out yes right and that's what causes you to get what some would coin stuck yeah", "start": 296.479, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "well there's your problem so and you don't really believe in let's let's get the club more in front of us necessarily let's just figure out how to", "start": 305.44, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "work better into the ground and pivot correctly yeah i'm not really a fan of trying to make your arms do something faster right i'm a fan of trying to get", "start": 313.36, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "your body to move a little bit better right not that there aren't multiple ways to fix things but i think that the more dynamic way is like this this is how the", "start": 320.56, "duration": 18.519}
{"chunk": "good movers move oh i'm gonna can i hit one slow with this thing yeah just to feel it for sure", "start": 329.759, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "[Applause] so and you could also put a stick back here you've done this before a stick click drill where it clicks that other stick", "start": 342.33, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "yeah so with players who struggle to get their bodies to start unwinding and opening up i'll have them i'll put another stick there where it would be ideally at", "start": 355.36, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "impact and have you try to click the sticks before you hit the ball but the idea here is we're just getting into", "start": 363.68, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "the ground getting our our belt buckle to move down and around in transition because if we do that we're not spinning out we're", "start": 371.12, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "putting max force into the ground and we're gonna be way efficient so if you guys have some laser beams at home attach that to the belt buckle and make", "start": 379.44, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "a nice little path with your belt buckle make sure you don't hit the wall or the ceiling with it okay don't blind your kids back at home so thanks for watching make sure you", "start": 388.08, "duration": 19.401}
{"chunk": "subscribe and we'll see you next time", "start": 396.56, "duration": 4.12}
