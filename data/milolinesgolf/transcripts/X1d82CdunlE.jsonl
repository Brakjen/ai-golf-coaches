{"chunk": "let's zoom in on that so he's got kind of a a model grip for me I really like his grip he's got", "start": 7.879, "duration": 20.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "that strongish left hand and a really neutral right hand it just looks like he was born to hold the golf", "start": 16.76, "duration": 18.759}
{"chunk": "club looks great notice also the elbow is pointed down the target line the lead elbow yeah if we look at his lead elbow pointed up the target line so up his", "start": 26.679, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "upper arm is internally rotated you can see if we look at the the down the line you could see his left", "start": 36.559, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "forearm is just peeking out over the top of his right so that's nice okay let's put him in motion a little", "start": 44.44, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "bit so we got a a little trigger see there's a little you can just see that little bump we look at this", "start": 52.359, "duration": 19.121}
{"chunk": "one he kind of squeezes his arms bumps and has a little early shift off the ball which I really love to see that", "start": 62.0, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "nice little early shift and we wind him up you know back swing is pretty much just kind of text book can we talk about", "start": 69.68, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "so you know some people might say P1 and P2 so call that P2 with a sha parallel the ground can we talk about how the", "start": 78.08, "duration": 15.158000000000001}
{"chunk": "fact that literally nothing has happened with his hands and wrists it's literally him just turning it back to there pretty much yeah he shifted a little and then", "start": 86.079, "duration": 18.242}
{"chunk": "turned his ribs how many swings go wrong those first few feet a lot most he Bas he basically kept that triangle between", "start": 94.72, "duration": 15.838000000000001}
{"chunk": "his shoulders and his arms down to his hands the triangle stayed neutral the whole way to there yeah there's nothing nothing's really happened it's really just simple he's probably pretty good at", "start": 103.079, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "Foundation one I would guess he is then he starts to load his wrists and we can see he gets the club a little stood up so if we draw a line down through that", "start": 112.04, "duration": 18.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "it's pointing inside the ball kind of textbook and then if we keep winding them up I'm going to zoom out just a", "start": 121.92, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "little bit so I can see the whole picture you'll see naturally the the shaft's going to shallow out here so now", "start": 130.2, "duration": 15.158000000000001}
{"chunk": "that shaft went from kind of steep here shallows out and it's shallower than it was going away another thing is the hands are actually more out than", "start": 137.319, "duration": 17.400999999999996}
{"chunk": "they were going back which is a pattern I really like to see so you can see his grip of the club is on that that yellow", "start": 146.519, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "line and now as he changes directions the shaft shallows and his grip of the clubs out in front of that yellow line his pelvis has kept its depth really", "start": 154.2, "duration": 18.078000000000003}
{"chunk": "nice the way he trades bins the way he reenters right there as he's finishing the the", "start": 163.879, "duration": 19.322000000000003}
{"chunk": "winding one thing I find a little interesting with him is his pelvis in the back swing that he has a little his right hip kind of it works a little", "start": 173.08, "duration": 19.719}
{"chunk": "right maybe hikes a hair but it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just a thing yeah but he recovers nicely you know by right here it's", "start": 182.2, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "like yeah kind of how you would want it I would say if he was like struggling with pulls and over cutting it I might", "start": 192.28, "duration": 15.641}
{"chunk": "say Hey you could probably get that right hip a little more a little more around the corner back around but I don't think he struggles with those I", "start": 200.76, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "don't think he struggles with much look at that right arm under coming down yeah it's perfect right there you guys see that look at that right arm under", "start": 208.319, "duration": 19.719}
{"chunk": "the left arm is still kind of stretching you can see it stretch right there it stretches as he falls and starts to unwind so he's pretty much fully loaded", "start": 217.799, "duration": 20.36}
{"chunk": "right here at just after P5 and now it's just get out of the way because she's coming around and everything is you know", "start": 228.159, "duration": 20.602}
{"chunk": "just pretty much textbook not a lot of face rotation the shaft is more or less parallel to his rotation if you notice right there on the down the", "start": 238.28, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "line view Milo if if you went back to that P5 section you had and drew a line where you right there that shaft is", "start": 249.56, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "going to mirror it so symmetrical on the other side let me get rid of all the lines and so if we good point put this", "start": 258.4, "duration": 15.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "shaft in so it from this point on it's basically the the club follows that Arc all the way around it doesn't wobble so there it's exactly parallel to", "start": 265.84, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "that Arc then it's going to swing up and there it is on the right back on the AR there exactly he's so symmetrical which", "start": 275.199, "duration": 19.160000000000004}
{"chunk": "is why he's so consistent with his Arc finishing the corner he does that pretty good too self evaluate yourselves and you notice that you're not too bad on", "start": 283.88, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "the downswing but then you're you exit very very high you're probably getting way too much rightward path and hitting big old draws and pushes and then if you", "start": 292.199, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "find your exit is very very low yeah then you're probably hitting WIP cuts and pull hooks so try to be as symmetrical as you can yep one thing I", "start": 300.52, "duration": 19.399}
{"chunk": "really like when I look at this I like how the just the geometry of how things shallow out and it gets basically on", "start": 311.039, "duration": 15.122000000000002}
{"chunk": "plane perfectly by five so right there it's now for the rest of the golf swing he's swinging on that plane it's nice", "start": 317.72, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "very simple now notice this here when Milo's moving the one on the face on when he replants and reenters himself it", "start": 326.12, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "looks like his left heel stays or actually moves a little closer when he reenters and then when he's pushing up if that foot spins out doesn't matter by", "start": 334.639, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "then it doesn't matter no most of the best their lead lead heel is going to move a little closer to the Target in that transition phase but what I like", "start": 344.16, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "about his motion is it doesn't look like it increases too much from that point it doesn't look like his hips fire and and his chest gets left behind M he", "start": 353.4, "duration": 20.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "definitely flexes and his chest is his chest is rapidly catching you can see by by contact his hips and his chest are", "start": 363.199, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "almost matched up which is my preferred pattern I don't like to see the hips really open and the chest really still Square it's too much torque on the low", "start": 371.4, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "back Milo I posted a couple other clips that we've shared before on Instagram you guys might have seen that I shared these these are the two drills he works", "start": 379.4, "duration": 18.040000000000003}
{"chunk": "on I thought this was really interesting so there you go to fix early extension auberg turned at home drill during the winter time where he was back", "start": 388.88, "duration": 18.158}
{"chunk": "home he basically put a chair outside of his butt behind him keep pressure on the chair so there's your space making space", "start": 397.639, "duration": 19.802}
{"chunk": "and then the other drill he did so making sure my hands are in front of the the what do he called it line of fire so", "start": 407.56, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "keeping the hands in front of the club head is that not foundation too more or less pretty much yeah so the question is how do you do that you can drive your", "start": 415.52, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "hands but he's creating forward shaff as you saw in those videos through the whole system it's not just a hands and", "start": 424.52, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "arms motion so but really interesting that those are kind of the two feels or drills or exercises he's gone back to", "start": 433.08, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "and you know I think those run pretty parallel with what we coach I think it's pretty cool also Milo you and I did that one YouTube video on his warm-up drill", "start": 441.8, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "where he opens his right palm and he actually makes golf swings yeah so he guarantees that he's pressuring the shaft with his right hand because his", "start": 450.96, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "right hand matches that club face and his left hand is a little bit on the stronger side and he actually hits shots they may only go 20 30 40 yards but he's", "start": 460.68, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "actually hitting shots on a te making sure that he's maintaining that pressure and that right wrist extension look at that look at that relationship guys", "start": 469.52, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "that's past impact that's with a wedge so you don't have it's not maybe going to be quite as much rotation he's got Turf interaction too but look how stable", "start": 477.879, "duration": 18.919}
{"chunk": "that looks that literally is almost identical to how he gripped it at setup with the Angles and his wrists and hands", "start": 487.159, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "and look at the the face stability so um that's what he's talking about with adding a little he's having a little pressure to the shaft through his hands", "start": 494.36, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "being a little forward and how he's moving his system through so it's a pretty cool look for sure that's really", "start": 503.8, "duration": 15.758}
{"chunk": "good", "start": 511.039, "duration": 3.0}
