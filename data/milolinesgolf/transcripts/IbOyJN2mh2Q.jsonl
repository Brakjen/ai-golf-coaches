{"chunk": "we're doing so as we start away what we're going to do is we're going to shift our mass just a little bit", "start": 65.04, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "toward our trail foot and then begin to rotate so it's a little shift and then rotate", "start": 72.64, "duration": 17.6}

{"chunk": "so previously henry and i did a video talking about three different ways that we see professionals take the club away or really good players take the club", "start": 115.28, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "away and we'll put a link to that here in the description but what those really are is you see some players almost drag the", "start": 123.6, "duration": 15.441}
{"chunk": "handle a little before the head starts to go you see other players move everything in one piece and some start to hinge the club right", "start": 131.68, "duration": 20.72}

{"chunk": "now if we're swinging the club back correctly it almost always follows the correct path", "start": 187.12, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "so a really good drill for you to learn how to do this is to start with the club forward before we swing it backward so i'm going to do it one-handed so you can", "start": 195.28, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "see how the club's momentum makes it follow the correct arc so if i take the club and i toss it forward and swing it back", "start": 204.159, "duration": 15.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "it naturally follows the proper arc so in our swing we want to feel like that's what we're doing it's a little complicated because", "start": 211.599, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "there's a ball there so i really can't make the club go forward to go backward if we could do that it would be really easy to swing it back on plane but what", "start": 220.959, "duration": 16.08}
