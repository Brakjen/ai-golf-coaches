{"chunk": "don't ever they don't come down it right so I guess I should preface it then saying that for a lot of our Advanced players being in this channel in the", "start": 162.36, "duration": 18.901}
{"chunk": "backswing maybe not as big of a concern but for you at home chances are if you're really routing it crazy super in", "start": 171.42, "duration": 16.32}

{"chunk": "at least that's what it's going to feel like now my swing actually is a little more on the steeper side it's it's coming down somewhere more on my shoulder plane", "start": 239.519, "duration": 16.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "not way down on my elbow or forearm plane yeah and we could talk about that too is like basically relatively speaking the 11 o'clock we", "start": 246.78, "duration": 16.2}

{"chunk": "fairly large Spectrum but that being said we get a lot of students that fall outside of that Spectrum yeah and when", "start": 264.06, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "you get outside of this side you're really steeping across the line and we've seen some this dumped under where now you're hitting way behind the ball", "start": 271.919, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "and your path is way out to the right I see players all the time who's trying they're trying to get this thing horizontal basically yeah and they're", "start": 280.8, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "doing it with a lot of body tilting and so now that club is you know it's nowhere near coming in down that channel yeah when you got on", "start": 289.02, "duration": 19.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "ball line so go to the top again you said when you kind of slot it to that in transition left arm parallel now this", "start": 299.16, "duration": 17.1}
{"chunk": "guy is pointed I have it right now just outside ball line but in real swing you're just about on ball line yeah I don't ever really get off ball line yeah", "start": 307.56, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "I get more vertical than ball line and I go right on the ball line pretty pretty fast in my transition yeah and then I'm on ball line the whole rest of the swing", "start": 315.72, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "and that matches up with with these with these angles this this plane right so if you're kind of just outside ball line at that left arm parallel there you go I'd", "start": 323.699, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "be on the shallower one slightly yeah but that's kind of what I feel like I do now in reality I'm more", "start": 332.58, "duration": 16.139}
{"chunk": "probably right there coming right down the channel we cannot push the club out in transition yep", "start": 340.62, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "which is super common yeah people swing it up they want to go to the ball so they take the club head to the ball yeah like immediately their", "start": 347.759, "duration": 19.441}

{"chunk": "rather see you get back to this 10 o'clock and it's gonna feel like you're at nine yes so that's the hard part you're going", "start": 393.419, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "to feel in your hands and wrists that the golf club is like this for a lot of people it's going to feel like that exactly so you're letting this club", "start": 402.0, "duration": 15.98}

{"chunk": "going to feel way different to you in terms of how your hands and arms are working yes because for many like you say they're pushing or driving that club", "start": 420.96, "duration": 17.939}
{"chunk": "out they're driving their hands out so if they can feel like if anything the hands and arms are working almost back", "start": 430.08, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "and into them yeah so in reality they're they're there will be a feeling of the arms back whoa", "start": 438.96, "duration": 16.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "yeah the club back yeah and what that feels like to a lot of people when I help them it actually feels like their arms are going", "start": 447.12, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "up and back yeah as they're falling down yeah so it's like body posing down arms feel like they're going up and back but", "start": 456.06, "duration": 16.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "you can see that that didn't yeah I'm pulling it up and back but when I fall down that looks like it came down yeah", "start": 464.639, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "and that also helps my right arm start to my right wrist Works back into extension that feeling makes my right arm", "start": 473.099, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "yep abduct and move out in front of me a little bit more or it can now this thought this method we're laying out here is it's", "start": 481.319, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "nothing new you think of Ben Hogan's pane of glass you work with McLean for a while slotting the downswing I mean you have guys that come a little more in up", "start": 488.94, "duration": 17.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "and over but they get in that channel you have guys that go more out and away they get back in that channel so the channel really never changes that much", "start": 498.0, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "for the tour players coming down so how will you get there though that's the key and for many of you going and just", "start": 506.46, "duration": 15.019}
{"chunk": "understanding this just feeling this knowing that okay there's kind of that channel there I'm just trying to get back in there instead of pushing or", "start": 514.76, "duration": 15.940000000000001}
{"chunk": "throwing everything out because most mostly watching are probably getting it to out is my guess most are two out and then", "start": 523.2, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "the players that are fairly good that struggle with blocks and hooks a lot of times they're getting it dumped under so the feeling that they might have to have I don't really like to have them ever", "start": 531.839, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "feel like they're making the club head move out yeah but I would love them to feel like they're making their body Flex down and open yeah and stay stacked", "start": 541.14, "duration": 16.981}
{"chunk": "up that's going to move this the whole system more out rather than tilting like this and getting it trapped behind them", "start": 549.3, "duration": 15.78}
{"chunk": "yeah so now that helped move everything out so I thought that I like that kind of goes with that is that your hands if you go back up to kind of left arm", "start": 557.16, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "parallel your Le your hands are working kind of towards the ball but with your pivot not just driving the hands but they're working together with everything", "start": 564.54, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "and chances are if you're if you have the right wrist conditions now the club and shaft are lined up in a nice spot where the hands are working towards the", "start": 573.66, "duration": 19.738999999999997}
{"chunk": "golf ball not pushing them way out away yeah where it's you know away from the ball which we see so often yeah so", "start": 582.839, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "um okay so a couple exercises they can do if you don't have a Channel at home and you can just set this up I mean that's another good way they could do it", "start": 593.58, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "don't put it so close to the backswing where you're going to hit it or the downswinger you're going to hit it make sure it's far enough away it's just a guide It's a reference but you could do", "start": 601.98, "duration": 17.700000000000003}
{"chunk": "a lot of little half swings from there or go down to delivery why don't you show them one where you go to delivery so you make a backswing you kind of drop", "start": 610.86, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "in check it say okay how does that look look at his face angle is even Leading Edge is matched up with his spine shaft is behind his hands there club's a", "start": 618.959, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "little behind his hands yep so you could do a couple of those and then chip one from there so that's a nice little exercise you can", "start": 627.66, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "do a real simple one too is just put a bucket outside your golf ball and don't hit it because so for so many", "start": 635.22, "duration": 16.739}
{"chunk": "at home you'd bash that bucket right there yeah I actually put it just slightly in the way so they can't you don't make your normal backswing you actually will start with your backswing", "start": 644.16, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "behind this yeah on top of it and get into the ball without I think it has a little 11 o'clock plane built in because", "start": 652.68, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "of the bucket yeah exactly so why don't you hit one from there for him yeah probably just full swing it from there right oh sure get my hands out of the way", "start": 660.779, "duration": 18.341}
{"chunk": "so that's one of the easiest drills you can do at home is just put something outside the golf ball because you can't be in the 1011 slot", "start": 671.519, "duration": 17.221}
{"chunk": "if you whack that object whatever is outside the golf ball yeah possible yeah you got to the wrong side there you go so that's a real simple drill too if we", "start": 679.56, "duration": 17.819000000000003}
{"chunk": "can just kind of get in that channel for many of you throughout the swing the backswing yes it doesn't always matter", "start": 689.1, "duration": 15.061}
{"chunk": "but for a lot of you at home it can set the stage if we get two in and around and get out of bends and things like that your backswing can make or break", "start": 696.42, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "you if you do a certain certain things incorrectly yeah but if you're within some there are some parameters you know you can you can do", "start": 705.72, "duration": 15.178999999999998}
{"chunk": "some goofy things or some things that look unorthodox as long as they don't throw off a few other things there's a few elements that must be if you're if your body inclinations are getting", "start": 713.64, "duration": 17.459999999999997}
{"chunk": "thrown off by what you do in your backswing you're going to struggle yeah if you make an unorthodox backswing but yet your body still moves okay you'll", "start": 722.399, "duration": 19.321}
{"chunk": "probably figure it out so try to find that 10 to 11 Channel foreign you guys probably want some individual help so make sure you check out our", "start": 731.76, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "Online Academy where we can help you on a one-on-one basis make sure that the way your finding this channel works for you because everyone's going to be", "start": 750.24, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "different right so for sure this whole process our Academy is not just laying out our philosophy and how to go step by step it's that one-on-one time that you", "start": 758.399, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "guys need to kind of pinpoint what to work on so make sure you guys like And subscribe and thanks for watching you ready yeah", "start": 767.1, "duration": 17.639}
