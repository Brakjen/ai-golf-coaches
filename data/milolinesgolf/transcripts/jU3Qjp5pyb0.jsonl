{"chunk": "shanks all right i said the word got it out there take a deep breath we got the answer for it", "start": 74.56, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "our listeners at home so there's a few ways that we've seen that cause a shank yeah so i would say the most common the", "start": 82.159, "duration": 16.722}
{"chunk": "most common one i see is people getting the club kind of out yeah and over usually their path is slightly across", "start": 91.28, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "right um a lot of times the face is even closed and they hit big poles along with the shanks right um and everyone at home or i would say a good", "start": 98.32, "duration": 17.919}

{"chunk": "are like oh my gosh it's going right well a lot of times they think that the face is open right when in reality the face is not open really closing down yeah because usually", "start": 115.36, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "the next shot is a pool and oftentimes the pattern that they're seeing is pulls so they're hitting pulls and pull hooks", "start": 124.32, "duration": 15.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "and pull draws and then a shank right so essentially the club is getting to the outside of", "start": 132.16, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "the golf ball yes and the other way i see people shank it so there's the kind of out and over the", "start": 140.64, "duration": 16.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "other way i see people do it is they might actually move their body under or into the ball and get the club back behind them right", "start": 148.239, "duration": 16.080999999999996}
{"chunk": "and then they kind of tumble the club out into the ball and so the club still gets out past the ball because the only way we can hit this hosel is for that club to get be getting", "start": 156.48, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "tumbled out past the ball right so almost like a little bit of whether it's slide and early extension a combination", "start": 164.08, "duration": 17.278999999999996}
{"chunk": "and basically our we don't have any room anymore we've taken the room away and we have to throw the club yeah so you have to in order to get the club head to the ball", "start": 172.239, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "my my turn is not going to do it for me so now i've got to apply something right to get that club to the ball and you can see it's really easy i can get it out past the ball right so", "start": 181.84, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "essential i mean all it is is the club the center of the club face is getting to the outside of the ball and then you have you hit your hosel yeah so so then that", "start": 189.44, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "ball goes right there something is moving into the ball now something's causing you to definitely move into the golf ball", "start": 197.76, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "yeah so we have a really quick easy solution for this yeah and we brought a little pool noodle out here yeah and you can use a water", "start": 204.959, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "bottle a head cover pretty much anything you want i like a noodle especially if it has a little curve in", "start": 213.28, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "it i think we got a rod in this one but just so it you see a little bit of that end in path we like to see yeah because in my golf swing i want to see the club", "start": 220.56, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "working in and away from that art from that noodle and then as it comes down i want it to be working back out toward the noodle only until i hit the ball though right", "start": 228.799, "duration": 16.962}
{"chunk": "and then it goes back away from the noodle so i don't really want that that club traveling out to the right and i don't want it to get on this side of the noodle too early and", "start": 238.0, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "then come down into the ball that way right so really just starting with a little like waist high to waist high in here is a great thing", "start": 246.879, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "and you know you can have the noodle in here pretty tight hit a few off the toe first yeah so if i was if i was working with somebody who had the shanks i would definitely", "start": 254.56, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "use a barrier like this maybe have them start off just hitting some little shots like that where they don't hit the noodle", "start": 262.72, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "and then once they can do that we just grow it even another golf ball like a water bottle", "start": 270.479, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "just something there to ensure that i mean if you hit it you'll know like oh man okay well you might move i'm gonna do this wrong on purpose", "start": 277.84, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "so if i get this club coming i got the noodle nice divot there a lot of times when you hit a shank too you'll see this long", "start": 287.28, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "skinny divot yep because you're really trying to close that face down right at the last second for sure so again the simple fix for the", "start": 297.12, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "shank is put a barrier out here outside the ball make the club work in and in don't ever let that club get", "start": 307.28, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "out on that side of your your barrier yep sweet awesome anything we want to add to that no i think that's perfect get something", "start": 316.56, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "simple put on the outside of the ball if you're having trouble on the golf course don't shut that face down if anything feel like it's a little bit", "start": 326.08, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "you can have it a little bit open and try to swing a little into out but you know i guess if you are going this way though that could be problematic yeah that can be that's the", "start": 333.68, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "other way i see people shaking i start adding rotation to a person who's tends to be this way and they feel like this is rotation and the club falls back", "start": 343.039, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "and then they're yeah not good but most often i see people try to correct it with shutting the faces set up especially for sure yeah you see you", "start": 351.759, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "definitely see that so here you go put a barrier out there make sure the club's working back down into the ball", "start": 360.319, "duration": 19.2}
