{"chunk": "squeeze that ball there you go great and what you'll notice like does it feel are you trying to rotate when you're doing this really if anything it just", "start": 7.44, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "re-squares because i'm moving down [Music] hey everybody we're back with elite golf school riley andrews good to see you", "start": 14.639, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "again absolutely and milo course and we're talking today about how to squeeze your trail hip in the downswing this is something", "start": 25.84, "duration": 20.399}
{"chunk": "i've struggled with immensely since i can remember i mean i look at old junior golf videos and it was like slide", "start": 35.68, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "and trail hip moving in towards the ball and i basically just had to manage face and path and just pray yeah i'm still working on this is", "start": 44.399, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "sure it's a bugaboo right you can't always just get out of something in your golf swing you're always kind of mitigating it right sure to some extent both habits", "start": 53.36, "duration": 19.118000000000002}
{"chunk": "come back absolutely so something we've worked on a little bit sort of feeling like in transition i'm kind of compressing or getting the chest down or", "start": 62.559, "duration": 17.362}
{"chunk": "falling um there's so many ways it turns it but we're tournament but we're going to talk about squeezing sort of that crunch right", "start": 71.52, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "feeling like maybe the my pants and my thigh here move towards my sort of right oblique a little bit", "start": 80.32, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "right exactly that angle small yeah it's decreasing i think this is something milo you and i see 99 out of 100 players tend to go right", "start": 87.28, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "into the pattern henry was just talking about right so like you said mitigating's a great word for that um i think a lot of the time", "start": 96.32, "duration": 21.519}
{"chunk": "players have just a wrong image of how to get that onto that and it screws up the whole system right and i think a lot of players are yeah", "start": 106.159, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "exactly we just get into this linear mode where the ball goes from here to here and all of that our body follows suit", "start": 115.68, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "and so everything's going this direction including the pelvis and especially that trail here when in actuality the golf club is swinging on this circle", "start": 123.759, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "and our body supports that that's why we love rotation rotation is circular so it matches up with how the instrument is built", "start": 132.56, "duration": 15.518999999999998}
{"chunk": "so the reason that squeezing is important is it allows for us to have trunk rotation or t-spine rotation", "start": 139.68, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "once you shoot that trail hip and it goes into extension or if the pelvis is rotating now our trunk has to make up for that", "start": 149.04, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "boo-boo right and our trunk will tilt and it slots the golf club okay but now we're in trouble because you lose all the good stuff that good ball strikers", "start": 157.36, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "really have through impact so let's put that into action so let me just talk about it go ahead and get that one um", "start": 165.36, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "swing one somewhere into the backswing and the first thing we're gonna do from right there is if i put a golf ball right here guys where i'm putting his golf ball is right in this like little", "start": 172.72, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "crease and he's going to squeeze that ball squeeze that ball there you go great and what you'll notice like does it feel are you trying to rotate when you're doing", "start": 182.319, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "this really if anything it just re-squares because i'm moving down yeah right because i'm not going to move down this way it's exactly right so i am i", "start": 191.2, "duration": 18.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "rotating maybe a little bit because i'm as i sit i i re-center a little bit yeah and a lot of people like when they do this because we've turned and we've", "start": 200.239, "duration": 17.842000000000002}
{"chunk": "loaded up a lot of the bands in our body on how we're rotating or once i've rotated into the backswing if i just think of this trail hip is", "start": 209.2, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "squeezing you'll notice that all this starts to rotate but i don't have to force it i'm not going okay from here i need to turn nope i just shot that out", "start": 217.2, "duration": 17.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "well that's an extensive that's a big topic we've had come up and we have a few videos that we've covered on this is that i think there's this misinterpretation", "start": 225.68, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "that milo and i i mean you guys get this too we're just talking about spinning talking about rotating right from the top well it doesn't happen that way", "start": 235.28, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "because if we rotate it right from the top look what probably happens we're firing we're spinning out so it's like that old tiger video with butch right same thing", "start": 243.599, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "yeah you're spinning out you're old laying right well i got laid i got open uh-huh right so really we're actually if you look at", "start": 252.879, "duration": 18.322}
{"chunk": "it our chest is actually staying closed for a little bit yep yep you can still look on this side right like you're going squeeze boom you", "start": 262.0, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "can stay over here compared to the spin out that you're talking about you're just gone and now it's a recovery mission from that point so", "start": 270.08, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "um but yeah this is something like i've talked about i've struggled with because my first move forever was to get this hip", "start": 278.56, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "going linear like you said i like that you said that towards the target a little bit and when it did that then this", "start": 287.199, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "trail hip gets pulled in and then i come out of posture it looks kind of like that yep", "start": 295.04, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "and there's a pressure back here like that is just done high handle high handle all the look so", "start": 302.88, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "i think to have less of the like gross feeling down here which is at the end of the day that's what every golfer is looking for when they're fee when", "start": 315.36, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "they feel well like this feels like i don't want to say in control milo because it shoot you were just talking about it where it feels almost out of control", "start": 323.68, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "when it's proper but it feels right but it feels like you own it you own this area so well like how the golf club is working through your momentum is working", "start": 332.8, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "in your in your favor so you're just like it's easy to guide yeah you're not you're not having to like control it with your muscles it just kind of goes", "start": 340.639, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "where you want it to without you trying to yeah well let's bring up a game he knows well is baseball right and to me if i play baseball as a kid", "start": 348.08, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "like if i had a t-ball harrison was throwing me a pitch would i ever go like this with a baseball bat that ball's up here", "start": 357.12, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "yeah i mean that's got to be a high pitch right it's got to be a high heater or something but you know if it's coming in you know in the strike zone here my hips are back", "start": 366.4, "duration": 17.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "and i'm just turning the corner right yeah so why can't i do that in a golf swing because like so watch this so do the", "start": 374.88, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "exact same thing yep okay boom now if you wanted to get this to the ball wouldn't we just in decrease this angle so that now you're", "start": 382.24, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "there now it changes the circle so there's pelvic depth compared to there just that change that and there's a little maybe a little more roundedness", "start": 391.52, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "up here too but i feel that yeah a bit exactly exactly that's just the whole system working with you but the more that you can feel that", "start": 399.12, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "action it pitches this plane bang where the golf ball is rather than playing t-ball right even though in baseball we still see a heck of a lot of pelvic depth but", "start": 407.12, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "it's a little bit different in the rotational aspect of where the ball is looking baseball's so variable some some baseball swings are golf swings", "start": 416.88, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "you know if i threw you a low inside pitch right here and you have a little short bat it would look like a golf swing yeah you got to go get it yep so you", "start": 425.039, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "baseball swings are very they vary because you know the pitch is in a whole bunch of different places where golf swings are a little closer to the same", "start": 433.68, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "they have 14 different clubs so they are slightly different sure but not nearly as different as baseball yeah so", "start": 442.0, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "that was like a little i'm doing a hybrid drill here with this baseball field okay so i'm getting my set up i'm going up to this plane", "start": 450.479, "duration": 16.082}
{"chunk": "there it is boom and notice guys when he did that how low like do that one more time that was beautiful like you didn't even hear it", "start": 461.28, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "how heavy that strike is it's solid boom good stay right there for me he's how high his hands are now now go ahead and", "start": 467.919, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "show me pelvic depth look how much deeper the hands get they're like knee level that's hogan yeah that's excellent looking now you just turn the chest and", "start": 479.36, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "you're freaking dimed out that's so flush so everyone's trying to get this low left handle too but it's yeah it's not that the left is just this", "start": 487.28, "duration": 18.718}
{"chunk": "like we've got just moving around the circle yeah this is our right side of the circle this is the left side of the circle the reason that it goes low left", "start": 496.879, "duration": 17.520999999999997}
{"chunk": "is because now as henry turns his chest the handle if you do it slowly just starts to turn on that that arc but it's he you didn't have to do anything with", "start": 504.879, "duration": 15.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "your hands and arms there at all it's all done through rotation of your chest the chest the ribs exactly exactly okay", "start": 513.36, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "so give them a couple feels there what would be so i know you guys have done some stuff with like uh maybe a little", "start": 521.919, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "softball sort of thing or uh yep dodgeball sort of thing right you could almost tie it around you right you could do that for sure you can also", "start": 530.64, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "put um a head cover or something yeah you could do a lot of different things if i grab you a chair here go ahead and set", "start": 539.44, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "up yup i'll throw it in there beautiful so i'm just putting this chair just barely off of your right booty", "start": 546.88, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "cheek okay so go ahead and just swing it into the backswing good so that's just kind of sitting on there yep now with your trail hip notice i didn't put it", "start": 556.959, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "behind this left left loop push that back through that squeeze there you go and if that this had wheels then he would just scoot this right back behind", "start": 564.56, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "him boom so now there's that squeeze right in that trail hip excellent good so if i put that right on your on your right booty cheek there now go", "start": 572.32, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "ahead and just push that at me there you go see how that trail hip stays because here's the issue if you go back up there again see if you just focus on the lead hip", "start": 582.72, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "this gets to like wander wherever it wants to go and so now you're what i notice right there too is my pressure yep is out on my toe", "start": 590.88, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "quickly exactly right and when that when that happens i feel like well if i kept going if i stayed down i'm driving this club", "start": 600.32, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "now right into the ground so what do i have to do i have to stand and back out head backs out but what you just showed me there was i", "start": 609.519, "duration": 16.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "almost felt like my pressure in my foot is still almost heel side a little bit if not even more heel side", "start": 617.36, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah especially for irons like if i get up and out so much with irons yeah yeah now you're all whacked out you can get away with it with a driver because", "start": 624.88, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "it's up here some of the best drivers in the world now are like that but with an iron that's kind of hard to control it's hard to do", "start": 634.56, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "it's a low point yeah low point control is really really difficult how about i hit one softly with that chair yeah let's do it set up", "start": 642.88, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "so i'm just barely putting this off of that right right glute okay when you're ready i'm out of the way i'm gonna do just a little bit of a yeah first thing push it", "start": 652.64, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "out of the way and then go ahead and turn good okay good that was really good yeah i'm not gonna make it even better this", "start": 661.92, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "is where we can just kind of get into like the match-ups of this whole code as you're pushing this right butt cheek back let your rib cage this whole structure", "start": 670.0, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "up here just float forward boom a little more so we'd go yeah go back up to the top for me so your job is to squeeze", "start": 678.48, "duration": 15.520999999999999}
{"chunk": "there you go so now you're feeling the you're into the heel still right yeah but you're trading pressure from the trail foot to the lead foot and now you're covered all", "start": 686.64, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "you have to do there is now just turn oh that looks so good there we go and now you control your bottom you can compress it a little bit", "start": 695.279, "duration": 15.520999999999999}
{"chunk": "easier from there we have a video that's not out it will be out soon is milo did this one where we we talked about when you get to the top and this", "start": 702.8, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "is about staying closed a little bit to start your transition is that from here you're landing left and this it appears", "start": 711.44, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "like your upper center surfs just a little bit yep and then from here now you're you're golden just yep you've saved your rotation but if", "start": 719.76, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "i'm back here even if i don't move off the ball much and i just turn yeah that's exactly right hear me yeah yeah", "start": 729.12, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "we're going to drag the handle up and forward yep yep yep exactly and then drag the handle is just because it's a reactive right and now you got to shove", "start": 739.36, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "this up to hopefully control the bottom when you did that with me that little just this a little bit yep that second one was so much more solid i could feel", "start": 746.48, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "the low point the first one was that little chunky hook one yeah second one without even thinking about it was yeah solid and i think in my opinion", "start": 755.6, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "there's kind of like two main ways to control your bottom mount and let me know your thoughts on this too milo i'd be super curious but one i can", "start": 764.8, "duration": 15.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "control my low point through my chest or from like the ribs up and two i could control it with where my pelvis is right so even if i squeeze", "start": 772.639, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "here but i haven't floated forward if i'm hitting like drop kick hooks like you just were you're going to figure out a way to extend to try to control the low", "start": 782.24, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "point by this mask this would i would say it would be the last way that yeah exactly drag yep and", "start": 790.8, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "that kind of matches up and just wrist extension jump yeah yes you know you can you can lose low point with that for sure exactly but this", "start": 798.32, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "is usually a byproduct of this yep exactly and you know yeah i mean and at some point we want this because we want the energy to get out of the system", "start": 807.44, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "we don't want to we don't want to hang on we want we don't want to hang on we want to let it go another misinterpretation another", "start": 816.959, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "misinterpretation we are getting you a place where you can let go more yeah that goes yeah you let go of the energy so once you've squeezed if i'm if", "start": 824.639, "duration": 17.842}
{"chunk": "i'm re-centering at the same time now from here like my heart's up my chest is up here like i have more bring", "start": 833.36, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "that club back around you exactly so now as i turn that golf club all the energy can get out of it here i can let it go", "start": 840.8, "duration": 15.680000000000001}
{"chunk": "compared to just sitting my my mass is still back if i drive the pelvis up to control my bottom out now i'm in a", "start": 849.04, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "difficult situation i can't get rid of it here i'm going to bottom out too much you're actually in a place where you can use your mass as a counterweight to sling the golf", "start": 856.959, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "club that's exactly right because if my math doesn't kind of float forward then i can't push it back to sling the energy out", "start": 865.12, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "yeah that's exactly because we really don't want the mask to keep going forward except maybe with the whip stays on top but with woods and longer clubs it comes forward", "start": 872.8, "duration": 18.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "and then it turns the corner and spits the energy out yeah and that's the whole code right it's like we want there's all that there's just the whole", "start": 882.399, "duration": 16.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "golf swing is always a match-up right we see these differences with all kinds of different players but like you're saying if my mass is up here", "start": 890.399, "duration": 15.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "and i'm turning as the energy shooting out towards the target or on this upward curve here well where do i need to go to counter it yeah i'm going to work back", "start": 897.76, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "so the more energy you put out of the system the more that you have to counter that exactly so we see that in the woods a heck of a lot more than a wedge which obviously there's a lot more", "start": 907.12, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "force exactly exactly and i don't know about you guys but that's how i feel like i control trajectory at a very high level is the more energy that i've hid", "start": 915.68, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "in this the lower that like not necessarily handle dragging but i maintain a little bit more of this structure and now i can flight one now i", "start": 924.16, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "can turn through and fight it as low as i want i want to hit a moon shot and i feel like i get energy out of there you can't hit a moon [Laughter]", "start": 932.72, "duration": 20.256999999999998}
{"chunk": "yep yep exactly so another another one that and milo and other coaches have done this one too you can have the chair in front of you", "start": 948.079, "duration": 18.402}
{"chunk": "too and do this at home it's just harder to hit golf balls with it right well there'll be a little more of an exercise you could do at the house so you get that chair maybe i'm going to", "start": 957.68, "duration": 17.917}
