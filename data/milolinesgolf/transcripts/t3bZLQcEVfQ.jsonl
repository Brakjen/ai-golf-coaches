{"chunk": "Growing up, my main sport was baseball, though I did play five sports in high school. Baseball was my my first love", "start": 115.439, "duration": 15.562000000000001}
{"chunk": "and I really thought I had a future in baseball, but an elbow injury caused me to have to give up the game that I", "start": 123.84, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "loved. Now, my dad loved golf. It was his other sport that he really loved. And from the time I was really little, he wanted me to play golf and I thought", "start": 131.2, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "it was the dumbest game ever and really didn't want to play. He even built me a a small set of clubs out of some of his older clubs and they got used one time", "start": 139.92, "duration": 21.68}
{"chunk": "and never used again. But when I got hurt, I quickly caught the bug. I decided swinging a golf club didn't hurt", "start": 149.84, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "and so I started playing. The first thing I was taught was a golf grip that went along with my baseball swing. So my dad was a baseball player and he had", "start": 159.84, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "learned to play the game at a scratch level and he knew from his experience that a slightly stronger grip made the", "start": 168.8, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "game a lot easier for him. So he went that route with me. He put my hand my left hand on in a slightly stronger fashion like this where I could see some", "start": 176.319, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "knuckles and then he made my right hand more or less match the face. So real quick, let me grab a bat and show you", "start": 184.319, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "what he showed me about the grip. So, we had a bat in my hands and he had me learn to create impact. And then he", "start": 191.599, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "put my thumb in the position like a golf grip and then he matched my right hand so it was straight on the back of the", "start": 202.879, "duration": 15.800999999999998}
{"chunk": "bat like this and then brought it back and that c that began to be my grip. So, if I do the same thing here, I can", "start": 210.92, "duration": 18.918999999999997}

{"chunk": "grip that looks just about like what my current grip looks like. That was kind of the foundation of my golf swing. And", "start": 229.2, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "the next thing he told me was, \"Son, now that you have this good grip that matches up, you can actually use your", "start": 236.959, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "baseball swing to hit shots.\" So that's exactly what I did. I applied the same feels that I used in my baseball swing", "start": 244.959, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "to hit golf balls. There was a slight modification, however. When I hit baseballs, I tend to be a little more back.", "start": 253.36, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "That worked really good with driver, but when you put the ball on the ground, my low point was too far back. So, I had to learn what it felt like to get a little", "start": 261.759, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "more on top of it to move my low point a little more forward so I could make that ball first contact. So, let me show you", "start": 269.28, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "quickly from face on the adjustments I needed to make and the skills I needed to develop. So, as a hitter in baseball,", "start": 276.88, "duration": 19.04}

{"chunk": "if I stay back like this, my tendency is going to be to have the low point happen behind the golf ball. So, an adjustment I had to make is I had to", "start": 295.6, "duration": 20.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "learn to feel like I was on top of that ball. I felt like my chest was right on it, not tilted back behind it. So, let's", "start": 305.479, "duration": 17.64}

{"chunk": "tree in the way, which gave me the opportunity to learn to work the golf ball. So, that was my the beginnings of my golf swing. I learned to make the", "start": 364.24, "duration": 19.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "ball curve both ways around the tree. And I think having a stronger grip that gave me a little bit of face control was", "start": 374.56, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "real key to being able to do that. So, let's have a little bit of fun. We're going to imagine I'm back on the farm where I grew up and there's a tree out", "start": 381.6, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "here about 30 yards in front of me and I've got to curve it around that tree in both directions. So, let's grab a couple golf balls. I'm going to start with a", "start": 391.52, "duration": 18.4}

{"chunk": "this first one. Going under some branches out to that blue flag. Perfect. It didn't quite get back to the target, but it was a nice little", "start": 448.08, "duration": 15.32}
