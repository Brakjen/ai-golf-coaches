{"chunk": "covering a youtube response we had in uh reference to one of our recent videos with arms getting stuck right and how to unpin them", "start": 7.12, "duration": 18.158}
{"chunk": "[Music] so we talked about getting the arms off the chest back out in front of us and how that most of the most dynamic", "start": 18.73, "duration": 15.989}
{"chunk": "players do that yeah and then we had some people comment that said well you've you know they sent us some pictures of jim furyk and some some other people and", "start": 27.119, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "it's definitely true there are players that have won a lot more golf tournaments than either of us are ever going to win yeah who uh played with their arms back behind them", "start": 36.399, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "right i mean it seems like there's always an outlier to everything and there are and they've made it work their whole career which is pretty amazing", "start": 44.32, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "now the players that actually get their arms kind of back behind them do they generally hit it very far not usually not usually pretty hard to hit the ball", "start": 52.16, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "a long ways and make a lot of speed when your arms are back here like this right but jim furyk's a great example of somebody who hits it really consistently straight", "start": 61.28, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "yes yeah he wins us open type golf tournaments and he's trained that pattern his whole career right so um he's gotten really good", "start": 70.4, "duration": 21.52}
{"chunk": "at that sort of up back down around lower body slide rotation with this trail arm behind him he's gotten really", "start": 80.4, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "good at it so yep now just because somebody's good at that does that make it the right way or the most optimal way to do it", "start": 89.759, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "i would say it's not the most optimal doesn't mean it's the wrong way it's not necessarily wrong or right it's just not optimal if we're looking to hit it", "start": 97.52, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "far and you know win some big tournaments out there consistently like you're seeing dustin johnson these guys now ideally that arms get a little more back", "start": 105.84, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "in front of them as they're rotating yeah so definitely there are outliers but", "start": 115.2, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "most of the best players are not going to play from there so why don't we talk just quickly about jim furyk and another guy i think of too", "start": 124.799, "duration": 15.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "who maybe quite wasn't quite as extreme was david duvall yeah david duvall played with his his trail arm kind of got on his hip like this and everything", "start": 132.08, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "rotated together so at impact david looked something like this where his arm was definitely more across his chest and his chest was", "start": 141.04, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "really open yeah that guy rotated like a machine and when you look at like old pictures and videos of these guys too it it kind of looks exaggerated with", "start": 149.44, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "driver because it's teed up and they're coming in a little more underneath it correct yeah because as we all know with driver we have to shift the path a little bit more", "start": 157.44, "duration": 15.839999999999998}
{"chunk": "right so we can keep from fading it too much yeah and so everything gets a little more exaggerated with the driver", "start": 166.0, "duration": 17.519999999999996}
{"chunk": "yeah so when you did that that um that you showed that trail elbow here can you do that one more time down the line for him down the line", "start": 173.36, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "yeah when you had that sort of uh duval jim furyk look this elbow if you just turn back a little bit more", "start": 180.879, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "here was coming in right on this seam line here on your shirt well furix is behind it yeah he's like this he's really the extreme you got to be flexible to", "start": 189.44, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "pull that thing off but duvals i would say was more on that seam line kind of like if i had a resistant band here and i was doing some of these", "start": 198.239, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "uh internal external rotations right here attached and then i just rotate my body yes so he was really functional i mean super", "start": 206.48, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "consistent with that motion he was a great ball striker right but again it's it's it's difficult to get there", "start": 215.44, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "and grip plays a factor too right he had a super strong grip and just played like this his swing was", "start": 223.599, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "very rotary right more than most players are capable of doing yeah so this is why you're starting to see more and more training aids like", "start": 233.2, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "the g box for example that helps us get this arm structure back in front of us as we begin to rotate out of the way rather than getting it stuck behind us", "start": 240.72, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "yeah for optimum dynamics we definitely don't want this arm going the opposite direction of our turn so we want to make sure that at least comes", "start": 249.68, "duration": 15.039000000000001}
{"chunk": "with us or even moves just slightly faster than our pivot or you could be jim fjork i guess i take off i take his career he's pretty", "start": 257.759, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "dang good but i mean that just speaks volumes to his uh his short game as well which is just phenomenal so um but anyways so there's some little uh", "start": 265.759, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "tidbits on the trail arm and how to get it i guess unstuck back in front of you there are some outliers but they're very few and far between so", "start": 274.72, "duration": 19.761}
