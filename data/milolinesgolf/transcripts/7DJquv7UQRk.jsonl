{"chunk": "there's two main reasons that people hit the ball fat number one is poor sequencing so you're changing direction", "start": 118.56, "duration": 19.198}
{"chunk": "and you're unwinding the golf club back here if i do that you can see that the club's going to hit the ground back here unless i do something", "start": 127.759, "duration": 18.801}

{"chunk": "little bit of a early extension goes hand in hand with the throw now if you mistime it you hit it fat", "start": 145.04, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "or you hit it thin now what the best players are doing is they're not really trying to throw the club out of the top", "start": 153.12, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "there's a lot there's not much tension in their hands and arms and they're changing direction correctly okay the second", "start": 162.4, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "reason that people tend to hit the ball fat is that their pivot doesn't go around so they swing the club back and instead of going", "start": 170.879, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "around around around around they go tilt tilt tilt so now nothing's turning the club's having a very difficult time", "start": 179.44, "duration": 18.479}

{"chunk": "some other problems so what's the fix well the fix is first to make some swings taking the hands out so you want to feel", "start": 197.12, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "a motion where you're practicing turning back and through with very little hand action", "start": 206.0, "duration": 17.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "that gets your pivot working correctly kills two birds with one stone the next thing you want to do is you want to add in a little wrist", "start": 214.48, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "hinge so we're going to add in our little wrist hinge and then change direction and get that pivot working correctly if you do those things your sequence is", "start": 224.239, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "going to improve your pivot's going to improve the bottom of your swing arc will start to happen in front of the ball students who come out and see me rarely", "start": 232.799, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "need to be taught how to stop hitting a fat almost always it's cleared up as i clear up their pivoting issues", "start": 241.92, "duration": 15.758000000000001}
{"chunk": "and the tension in their hands and arms and sequencing so if we can get those pieces of the puzzle figured out so you're not applying a lot", "start": 249.519, "duration": 19.521}
