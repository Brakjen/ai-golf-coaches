{"chunk": "milo lines henry fall we're out here at superstition mountain golf and country club we're going to be talking about the plane swing here today", "start": 0.719, "duration": 16.402}
{"chunk": "a few concepts that we can use in our golf swing with the plane swing i mean excellent visual number one for sure i use it a lot for showing", "start": 13.84, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "visuals of how the motion works and i also like to use it a lot for helping people feel what it feels like from basically waist high to waste time on", "start": 23.519, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "the other side of their golf swing so yeah it's a really good training aid yep so we're going to start forward on here but then we're going to move down the line", "start": 31.679, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "we're also going to put the camera on the target side to really see how our body's working and sort of where the club is tracking", "start": 40.48, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "on this plane now this is adjustable it goes up more vertical plane and a more flat horizontal plane so it", "start": 49.039, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "kind of can fit to your body the key here though is that this club or we're using a shaft here does not have", "start": 56.239, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "to always be on this plane for sure so not everybody swings on a perfectly symmetrical back and up up the plane", "start": 64.96, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "down the plane swing right some players have a vertical backswing and then they shallow it onto the plane and other players are more in and up and", "start": 73.52, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "out but what really matters is from about here to here yep pretty much any tour player", "start": 82.08, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "if you put them there if you put them on video from down the line their swing does this right so from delivery position", "start": 90.24, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "to club parallel to ground in the through swing we call it p6 to p8 that's where it's going to be pretty constant you'll have a little end out", "start": 97.84, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "draw you might have a little cross-line fade but it's pretty constant for sure so an end-out draw would be you just tilt this plane swing slightly and you", "start": 105.6, "duration": 18.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "swing it slightly and out and a little fade would be tilted the other way slightly right but good players tend to be rooting you know they make a", "start": 114.72, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "kind of a half circle down there that bottom of the half circle is is pretty symmetrical and what you'll really see in the down the line what i love about this", "start": 122.64, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "this training aid we'll call it plane swing is that you really get the visual of golf being a side on sport it is not straight straight you know", "start": 130.64, "duration": 18.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "you're not bringing a club right out to the the target it's on a plane right swinging on a plane and going kind of around", "start": 140.16, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "you right now you're the center but you're constantly pivoting yep so i see a lot of amateurs when they're", "start": 148.56, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "swinging they are trying to be the center but they're not moving the center the center needs to pivot yeah so if", "start": 157.599, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "there's one thing that you really take away from this video it's the visual component in my mind that's what i really like on this uh this training aid awesome so", "start": 165.36, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "let me step in real quick we just can talk about a couple things from this angle um you know so i stepped in here i take", "start": 174.08, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "my pretty normal setup here and as i go back my club travels more on this plane you for example though for me this felt", "start": 181.68, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "like it was way too deep i swing i swing up off of it right and then i get back down on it about the time i get to there", "start": 191.12, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "right yeah so again called parallel to club parallel this is where it should be tracking the most", "start": 198.48, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "and riding this bar exactly so for me i like to get it right down to this delivery position and then accelerate to the finish and", "start": 205.36, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "use my body to spiral on this plane and finish right i actually have my club then come back off for sure yeah mine", "start": 218.159, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "i pretty sure mine would come back off as well let me see you do a couple in here so if i'm set up here when i swing back", "start": 227.76, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "my normal swing would get you know it's a six inches off that bar yeah so for me to get that on the bar it's", "start": 236.4, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "like oh my goodness that's what i do like how it forces you to get this really big turn oh yeah spiral i'm getting big turn", "start": 244.64, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "yeah i just tend to get my hands up more and now i would get back down on it right yeah i could feel it it hit it pretty hard right there and then we'd go around like that", "start": 252.159, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "and then in my follow through it would come back off right what i also like about this is what it does to your wrists and forces", "start": 260.959, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "you because if you just rotate your arms over you're kind of fighting this well if i rotate my arms over i get off of it", "start": 271.04, "duration": 20.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "so for me to keep my arm the shaft of this on the plane i can't twist", "start": 279.919, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "because i come off so it's pretty good aid to help you understand the motion of what your body needs to do yeah all right well let's take a look at", "start": 288.56, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "the down the line so they can see that visual as well we're down the line now i'm inside the plane swing i feel like i'm in a spaceship or", "start": 297.759, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "something pretty cool so again setting up following this plane on the way back for me like we said it's more on plane yours", "start": 306.08, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "comes off a little more and then shallows yep i have a little loop in my transition where you're more up the plane down the plane and we", "start": 315.44, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "really saw that when we actually put you on gears and we saw your avatar and how you moved the club it was pretty much up and down yeah", "start": 323.52, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "and if you look at my gears it's up and significant shallowing move and down so let's talk about a few players that we've seen throughout history", "start": 330.72, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "and how it relates to this plane here if we have let's say matt wolfe younger guy that you see now on tour matt wolf would be off of it", "start": 340.72, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "almost the entire swing and then he would shallow and he would get on it right there boom yep", "start": 349.12, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "yep same with like a jim furyk now let's say raymond floyd or jb holmes well they would go inside of it the", "start": 356.72, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "back and then they would come out and get on it and come down yep yep and then you have your maybe ben", "start": 366.16, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "hogan's or lee trevinos where it's a little more on this plane be close to on the plane but then shallow out just a little bit more yeah it might even be a flatter plane", "start": 375.44, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "and this would go down we'd have to lower it a little bit because they swing on a fairly shallow plane yeah and so the club works more around", "start": 384.96, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "and then shallows out even a little bit more and comes on a really you know pretty shallow plane into the ball yeah like a sergio and then someone might be a little more", "start": 392.72, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "vertical and it's amazing too because the clubs can dictate some of this too if you have flatter lie angles theoretically it might be a little", "start": 401.199, "duration": 15.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "flatter a little more upright might be more upright so yeah a lot of that is determined by your anatomy right right so", "start": 409.12, "duration": 16.558}
{"chunk": "tall people generally are going to swing more vertical short people generally going to swing more around yeah so that's why it's important that this thing is adjustable", "start": 417.039, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "yeah so for me again it goes back to this delivery position and you were saying the club parallel to club parallel", "start": 425.919, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "p6 to p8 here for me i want to have the the end of this club or shaft just inside my hands if i start getting them", "start": 434.0, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "outside i'm either stuck or it's slice city or a big pool if the face is shut yeah", "start": 443.28, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "so i like to have it right here exactly i like to feel like the hands is just slightly outside of that so that the head would be slightly behind your hands at that point", "start": 451.28, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "yep my body's starting to get in the ground i'm rotating and now i just spiral up to the finish", "start": 459.12, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "on this thing you can see right here i'm my spine is still on in angle here my eyes are still on this", "start": 466.96, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "angle everything is still on this plane yeah perfect so let me jump in there and make a swing real fast", "start": 480.0, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "see what that feels like so it's up the plane now mine would come off get back off and work around", "start": 489.199, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "but from here to here it feels so natural that's just my normal motion once i get yep that's just just what i would do", "start": 496.96, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "it's a great feeling from impact to wherever your finish is or let's say you even stop right here yeah because the club goes back around you to", "start": 507.039, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "the left club comes back around your hands you can see your hands go back around so you're not like this yep and you're on this nice tilt here", "start": 515.599, "duration": 17.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "yep your head's on tilt shoulders everything's angled like like the plane switch yeah so again this goes back to that visual", "start": 523.76, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "component understanding of using this all right so i don't know about you milo but when i'm looking at swings and i get a glance from a", "start": 531.6, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "target side camera angle of any of these tour pros i learn so much it's one of my favorite angles to look at because", "start": 539.76, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "you really start to see how the hips the body the chest starts opening up and the club goes back around you and it's just", "start": 546.64, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "for some people it's really hard to see that they think the club goes down the line at the target but when you see that target side camera", "start": 555.2, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "angle oh there's so much to learn it's so clear that the only time the club is actually kind of traveling up the target line is right here right so when you hit the", "start": 562.959, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "ball that's kind of the only time when the club was going somewhat straight other than that it's going up the plane over here down the plane and then back up and into", "start": 571.76, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "the up and in so it's not really ever going in a straight line yeah so i think it's just a great visual", "start": 580.08, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "and you know seeing the movement from that side how the body's working again staying on that tilt", "start": 587.839, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "and the club working back around you um just it's uh and this is why again i love this plane swing for that reason is you get to", "start": 595.6, "duration": 17.118}
{"chunk": "feel that um and have a sort of guide you know so for a beginner golfer this is a great starting point but they're all our pros that use this as well", "start": 604.079, "duration": 15.762}
{"chunk": "for sure yeah a lot of people like to train what it feels like from as we said p6 to p8 right and for those who don't know what", "start": 612.56, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "that is that's basically from waist high to waist high on the other side and so they're really training this this", "start": 620.959, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "arc it's an arc that's on a slight angle right yep and so if you can get really good from here over to here you're probably pretty good", "start": 628.48, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "yeah one other thing i like to think of when i'm in this is outside of just my my tilt my body how it's spiraling up", "start": 637.36, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "and then spiraling down and then back up is this trail arm in the hand i almost feel like my hand is matching this plane", "start": 645.519, "duration": 21.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "throughout the swing am i wrong to think that no it's a great visual the golf swing really doesn't need to have a lot of", "start": 656.16, "duration": 18.958000000000002}
{"chunk": "twisting in my opinion it would be simpler if we used less so if you can feel that in reality it's probably not going to happen exactly", "start": 665.519, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "like that right but that would be an awesome feel from this point in the swing over to this point in the swing and a lot of people are pretty good at actually getting that to happen from", "start": 675.279, "duration": 16.802000000000003}
{"chunk": "here to here that simplifies what happens down there around the ball now if we're having to do this down around the ball", "start": 683.44, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "you know we're beholding the timing some days we're gonna have it and some days we're gonna not have it well i mean one of the best players in the world now has spent", "start": 692.48, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "hours using something very similar to the plane swing that's bryson dechambeau and he talks about not having forearm rotation so to me", "start": 702.0, "duration": 21.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "again you get in here and i have that feeling like that right hand is just kind of following this this arc here", "start": 712.56, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "something that i i teach everybody yep so this is a plane swing um again great visual and a lot to learn from", "start": 720.48, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "from using this or at least watching a video on it for sure", "start": 728.16, "duration": 10.398}
