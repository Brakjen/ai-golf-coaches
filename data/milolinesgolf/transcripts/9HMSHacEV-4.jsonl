{"chunk": "horse with it okay and we're gonna see what the numbers look like okay i haven't hit a ball yet today and you have so you have the advantage but let's see if i can", "start": 9.28, "duration": 17.931}
{"chunk": "take you out let's do it [Music] all right milo so you challenged me to a game of horse so talk us through so what", "start": 17.6, "duration": 18.208}
{"chunk": "this game a horse is is you have to call the shot it's one of the nine ball flights okay you hit it and then", "start": 28.32, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "your opponent has to make the shot first try if they don't they get a letter just like horse with basketball right okay okay so", "start": 36.16, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "walk us through a little bit if if you're going to hit a low draw what what do you have to do what happens well yeah that was going to add a little wrinkle to this game so how about", "start": 45.2, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "before each shot we talk we talk through how we're going to hit it individually my way might be a little different than yours and see if maybe that's the most optimal", "start": 54.719, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "way and if there's any adjustments we could make sweet let's do that to it yeah i like that all right you want me to go first you call the shot no coin", "start": 64.32, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "flip no nothing no nothing all right so where are we aiming at that so the the center line is the far bunker our bunker out there okay", "start": 72.64, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "all right let's start with the try to do an easy one here a little low draw low draw i got an eight iron so", "start": 81.439, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "what would you say low is at least no more than halfway up that mountain with this club well it's probably gonna get about to the top with nate iron but i'll try to keep one low let's keep keep", "start": 89.68, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "it down are we hitting it full out still yeah full shot okay all right so what i would do for a low draw is i would set up i'm gonna aim this", "start": 98.96, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "face i'm gonna probably aim at about eight ten yards right of that bunker that we were looking at okay i'm gonna actually have my body pretty square", "start": 109.04, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "maybe even slightly open i'm gonna have this ball pretty far back in my stance okay and that slightly open stance is to", "start": 118.0, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "offset a little shorter swing and the ball position let's see if i can hit this little low", "start": 126.719, "duration": 16.239}

{"chunk": "speed 118 ball 166 carry didn't quite catch your path or face for", "start": 149.04, "duration": 15.518}
{"chunk": "some reason but we know they must have been good because the ball started out to the right and drew back toward the line okay", "start": 156.879, "duration": 18.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "i guess i have to hit that same shot now the way i go about hitting that shot is first thing i'll do is i'll aim the face out to the right where i want the ball to start", "start": 164.72, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "so i'm going to aim it kind of the guy in the green shirt out there now i'm going to align my body my hair to the right so for me i'm going", "start": 177.28, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "to use my body lines because i'm and maybe move the ball back in my stance just a hair okay so now that face feels just slightly", "start": 186.8, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "closed relative to my body line then i'll just make my normal golf swing that was pretty yummy that was pretty good it didn't quite draw the way back", "start": 194.4, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "to the target i'll take a tight little draw though but it was pretty darn good i won't give you an h for that one so my club path was seven to the right", "start": 208.4, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "and my face was five to the right which made it draw back but not all the way so not far off from pretty optimal though so what would have been optimal what", "start": 215.92, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "would have made that ball come back to center line right right about three and a half so i was off by like a degree with a degree and a half with the face yeah how do you like that aoa at", "start": 224.64, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "negative eight it's not too bad for a little not too bad for that low of a shot it wasn't like you took a massive divot ring my divot was fairly skinny we didn't get your angle it didn't get", "start": 232.959, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "those numbers for yours but i would guess they're pretty similar and what's interesting is your the way you did it was just a little bit different than mine i wonder", "start": 241.439, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "if anything has to do with me hitting eight and you doing six iron maybe a little bit because i know with your stamps it was a little more closed you didn't move it", "start": 250.48, "duration": 16.399}

{"chunk": "little bit of me feeling like i stay down yeah that's how i create it i don't really like to move the ball far back in my stance too much because it", "start": 267.36, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "causes me to get that angle of attack it's even steeper yeah so that's how i do it that's kind of why i i open my stance just a little bit to", "start": 276.0, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "offset that yeah well that's it's just match-ups yeah you move it back aim a little bit more open and hit the same shot cool all right your", "start": 284.479, "duration": 18.72}

{"chunk": "grab an eight okay so what i'm gonna do here is i'm gonna align the face just a little bit to the left of my target probably like five yards", "start": 311.199, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "ten yards align my body a little bit more to the left [Music] and now i'm going to feel like i'm really swinging the golf club almost", "start": 320.56, "duration": 16.799}

{"chunk": "ball wants to ride up so here we go low in cutting [Music] it's just a hair of a fade on it yeah", "start": 337.039, "duration": 16.729}
{"chunk": "that's the ball that should have faded a lot they were perfect numbers that was pretty optimal so", "start": 350.88, "duration": 16.801}

{"chunk": "are aware at home we are hitting off a tee yes it's just because we don't want to tear up a ton of turf here so but that was a pretty good one", "start": 375.84, "duration": 16.239}

{"chunk": "the left yeah so you hit a low draw man you lose okay now we're going to go for the dreaded", "start": 432.56, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "straight ball we're going to go mid window straight this one's actually not impo not possible really but it happens on", "start": 440.8, "duration": 16.639}

{"chunk": "i think a little lower than that i mean i would think your six time would probably be almost top of mountain well i'm just mid number should be like i think", "start": 468.639, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "probably like 16 or 17. yeah would be like a middle okay here we go mid trajectory straight oh i miss hit it but it's pretty darn", "start": 476.08, "duration": 18.322000000000003}
{"chunk": "straight it was fairly high ah 16.4 launch all right that's a midterm that's right at two or average", "start": 487.68, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "all right all right it was straight 2.6 and 2.7 that's pretty darn straight this is track man", "start": 498.24, "duration": 17.037000000000003}

{"chunk": "still up in my stance and not just i'm just not going to cover it as much i'm going to stay back on it a little bit more", "start": 567.76, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "[Music] pretty nice high draw it's going to slightly over curve the center line but pretty good", "start": 578.12, "duration": 17.161}

{"chunk": "out to the right now i'm just going to feel like i swing along my body line slightly out to the right", "start": 614.399, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "no and i hit it straight oh boy dead straight i think we're tied milo that's an h for me that's my kryptonite i don't i don't", "start": 627.279, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "like that shot so one really important note on this sort of push draw high draw", "start": 635.76, "duration": 15.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "is you notice both of us didn't aim the face at the target we actually aimed it right at the target and then we tried to make our path even a little further", "start": 642.959, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "right yeah a lot of you at home were told when you were younger probably to aim the face at your target and then aim your body right and that", "start": 651.04, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "just makes you end up hooking it more because the club phase is two shut the club face really controls that starting line my path was perfect for that shot i just didn't get the face", "start": 660.079, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "squared up so i hit just like a oh okay where are we now let's go with a stock shot for me", "start": 668.72, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "mid high cut mid high mid high butter mid high cutter", "start": 677.6, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "got to walk through how i do it this one i don't think about i just aim and i hit it so i'm going to aim the face just just", "start": 684.56, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "left your launch was about 18 on that last one so i'm looking at like 15 16 somewhere in there somewhere around 16 probably actually since it's a fade it", "start": 692.8, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "probably won't be that much different but i aim the face just a little left and i aim my body what feels kind of parallel ish and then i just make my normal swing and this", "start": 700.16, "duration": 20.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "should be a little cutter pretty good that was a good one that seemed pretty shallow too even without the tee i don't think you would", "start": 709.36, "duration": 17.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "have taken much turf there nope and the numbers actually shouldn't have been that ball cut more than it should have", "start": 726.72, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "i thought it was pretty good yeah if we're playing golf we'd rather have a little too much curve oh yeah i would end up probably 10 feet to the right of", "start": 734.56, "duration": 15.597999999999999}
{"chunk": "my pen my target i mean granted a lot of people like to hit straight but like if you can rely and count on the ball curving", "start": 742.639, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "to me that's the more desirable way to play the game all right so the mid-high cut so i'm gonna have the ball still up in", "start": 751.04, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "my stance a little bit i'm gonna get my body aligned a little bit what feels left just tears start right but", "start": 761.279, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "you hit the shot but it was too far right you're in the green side bunker but yeah path was three to the left but face was the face was one a half degree", "start": 777.279, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "open isn't that funny though look at the carry on that one so 166 versus the hydra was 180 something right and you know", "start": 789.6, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "with an iron yeah the cut might not go quite as far because you might be generating a little more spin you know that little cuddy spin but you know that's a pretty significant", "start": 798.399, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "change yep and that that stock or not that stock but that high draw was hitting i was going out all out at it pretty much okay so did you get did you", "start": 806.88, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "pass that time i don't know it was pretty far off line so it's hard to hard to give it a pass it started to the right too big of a push fades that start", "start": 814.959, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "to the right don't count all right okay got to get it in that bunker oh it's your pick your pick i picked that one we haven't hit a", "start": 824.24, "duration": 15.758999999999999}
{"chunk": "low straight ball low and straight oh that's impossible can i hit it like 10 feet we haven't hit low and straight or high and straight or", "start": 831.92, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "medium draw low and straight so i'm gonna it's gonna be similar to that cut shot i hit because i wasn't that far off where i tried to hit that low cut", "start": 841.92, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "i'm just gonna try to get it started a little more online not have the face quite as shut down", "start": 851.36, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "see if i can keep this low and straight oh man that was pretty stinking straight on like a one yard fade maybe it's the win a one yard fade is straight", "start": 858.8, "duration": 16.238}
{"chunk": "in my world oh yeah that's pretty close and it launched 13 and a half that's pretty low for an eight iron that's", "start": 873.199, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "pretty good yeah that's good still carry 174 i don't know if that's right maybe yeah it's all normalized right now so that was with a good golf ball i hit it", "start": 880.399, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "pretty good okay low and straight i'm just going to move the ball back in my stance just a tiny bit and then do", "start": 889.279, "duration": 16.239}

{"chunk": "straighter than that that was pretty tasty i think our numbers are going to be like almost identical", "start": 913.04, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "yeah mine was what was my like 0.4 or something like that mine's 0.8 and 0.1 i'll give it to you pretty straight i'll give it to you it didn't curve i think", "start": 922.24, "duration": 18.637999999999998}

{"chunk": "mine launched at 12 degrees this one's at 13 point something what was interesting is you said right before you hit that shot you said i'm going to move the ball back just a", "start": 939.519, "duration": 17.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "little bit but still feel my normal swing normal cut shot so i'm assuming what you're you're doing there is your your start line becomes just slightly", "start": 947.68, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "more right because your path being a little more back in your stance goes a little more right exactly when i moved it back this much it shifted my path from a little to", "start": 956.639, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "the left to dead straight so you're almost hitting that little leech or vino just start it start it straight and hit it straight there you go hard to do but", "start": 964.32, "duration": 15.277999999999999}
{"chunk": "you know you get those numbers within less than one degree apart that ball doesn't curve very far all right give us one we haven't done milo medium high draw i guess that's that's", "start": 972.079, "duration": 19.121}
{"chunk": "it medium high draw oh we haven't done high straight oh we'll go high straight i'll do the medium high draw to wrap it up so high straight", "start": 981.44, "duration": 15.761}

{"chunk": "and i'm just going to feel like i stay back so i'm going to launch this one above 22 degrees we're going to we're going to put some air under this sucker", "start": 997.92, "duration": 20.44}
{"chunk": "and hit it straight that's the hard part oh oh i hit a fade i hit a fade", "start": 1007.04, "duration": 16.038}
