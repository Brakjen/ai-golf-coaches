{"chunk": "what is lead arm adduction well that is the this angle so this would be adduction", "start": 49.6, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "and this would be abduction so the arm coming off of the chest now a lot of players think that the arm stays on the chest the", "start": 57.68, "duration": 17.360000000000003}

{"chunk": "off the chest now how far does it come off the chest well it's not going to get that far off the chest because we got two hands on the golf club now if i was swinging it with one hand it would get away from me but because", "start": 84.32, "duration": 17.441000000000003}

{"chunk": "right i'll let you know but let's see so they start player on the left has 88 degree", "start": 119.68, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "angle lead arm reduction and the player on the right has a 95.5 now there are some really interesting things as these players", "start": 129.2, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "begin their back swings you'll notice some similarities notice that those angles are actually growing", "start": 137.36, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "in the early part of the backswing and that's because the the torso is actually turning away from the lead arm", "start": 148.239, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "before the lead arm begins to move so the torso is moving more in the case of the player on the left his hands actually go out a little bit", "start": 156.879, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "early the player on the right they really don't and you can still see that angle is", "start": 165.519, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "growing and then as the players both move up to the top of their back swings you can see that that angle begins to", "start": 173.12, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "shrink but you can see at the top of this player's backswing he's got a lead arm adduction angle", "start": 185.2, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "56 degrees and at the top of the player on the right swing he's got a lead arm adduction", "start": 195.92, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "angle of 64 degrees now in transition you'll see that angle", "start": 204.4, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "will tighten up even more because the body turns into the arm and then about just a few frames after transition", "start": 213.84, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "you'll start to see that arm bounce off the chest and begin slinging out now in the player on the left you'll be", "start": 225.2, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "able to see that lead arm reduction angle is going to get all the way out to 98.91 and the player on the", "start": 233.68, "duration": 20.68}
{"chunk": "right he's going to go from 64. that angle starts to tighten up so he turns into his lead arm", "start": 246.879, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "and now it starts to bounce off and he's going to run it all the way out to 103 degrees", "start": 256.32, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "so if we go back to address you can see that player on the", "start": 264.72, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "the right was at 95 player on the left was 88 top of the swing", "start": 272.72, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "56 and 64. and then at impact it's grown relative to so the lead arm is more off the chest than where it", "start": 280.88, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "started now let's circle around and look at some of these angles now you can see in both of these players that the lead arm is not touching the", "start": 291.44, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "chest now these are two of the best drivers on the planet and this holds true amongst many top", "start": 300.32, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "players so i'm going to go through and pull up a few others okay so here we've got a couple of different players on the screen on the left we've got a", "start": 309.199, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "fairly famous player and on the right we have another one maybe the setup will give him away that is these players move through their", "start": 317.36, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "swings so let's watch the player on the the left he starts at 84. same pattern holds true he turns", "start": 325.28, "duration": 18.078}
{"chunk": "away from his arms so that actually grows in the back swing then as he reaches the top of the backswing", "start": 335.199, "duration": 18.471999999999998}
{"chunk": "he reaches max [Applause] about 67 at the top and then in transition", "start": 343.68, "duration": 19.049}
{"chunk": "it's compressing now it's beginning to sling off the chest and impact he's going to arrive with 104 degrees", "start": 353.199, "duration": 21.28}
{"chunk": "of lead arm reduction we look at address to impact it's 20 degrees more off his chest", "start": 365.44, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "now let's see what the player on the bottom does so he starts it 82 degrees", "start": 374.88, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "and as he moves through his golf swing so he's 82 same thing's happening here his arms getting more", "start": 384.96, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "away from his body in the backswing now as he reaches the top of his backswing", "start": 393.039, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "you can see in the change of directions there adducts a little bit more now he starts down and the arm is beginning to sling off", "start": 402.88, "duration": 17.143}
{"chunk": "the body [Applause] and at impact he arrived back at 82.", "start": 415.12, "duration": 19.499000000000002}
{"chunk": "so what did he start at so his his lead arm only got back to where it started but you can still see that lead arm", "start": 423.599, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "is not really on the body in either one of these players it's starting to pull off [Applause]", "start": 432.16, "duration": 15.479000000000001}
{"chunk": "let's pull up one more example this is a student of mine he's one of the most dynamic players i know makes mid 120s club head speed without", "start": 441.52, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "trying very hard and this swing was 125 miles per hour you can see at address he's got the lead arm", "start": 451.12, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "adduction angle at 98 degrees see if we see the same pattern so as he starts away same thing his body", "start": 458.96, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "turns first turns off the arm so the arms get a little farther away", "start": 468.72, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "now they begin to adduct across the body and you can see in the change of directions the lead armor ducts a little bit more", "start": 474.479, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "now it's beginning to make its way off the body and down into impact it's now farther away than it started", "start": 487.84, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "and if we pan around you can clearly see that that lead arm is getting quite a", "start": 499.84, "duration": 17.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "bit away from that body and another thing you notice amongst all these great ball strikers their arms kind of look like home plate", "start": 507.44, "duration": 16.720999999999997}
{"chunk": "their elbows are not straight and in this example if we look at his elbow angles let's look up here at", "start": 516.8, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "the body and we'll be able to look at the joint angles and at impact his left elbow is", "start": 524.32, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "22 degrees bent and his right elbow is 18 degrees bent almost the same amount and that's pretty common amongst the best ball strikers now you", "start": 535.2, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "can see clearly in that gears analysis that the best players in the world as they're swinging down their lead arm goes more against them", "start": 545.44, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "but then that lead arm begins to move off of the chest and at impact the lead arm is more off the chest than where it started so if it starts at 90 degrees", "start": 553.519, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "it's going to be more off the chest than where it started so i hope this helps please like and subscribe and check me", "start": 563.12, "duration": 19.601}
