{"chunk": "it gives me a lot of time I've got all day to turn and hit that golf ball let's talk about shallowing the golf club made simple I like it it's not", "start": 7.799, "duration": 19.362000000000002}
{"chunk": "really that simple of a topic but it's not that complicated right Ed depending upon your certain variables yeah certainly yeah so let's just walk", "start": 22.02, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "through what shallowing the shaft out is well most people I mean look on the Spectrum we would love to be relatively", "start": 29.939, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "on plane in the backswing yes we certainly don't like to be under the plane because it's harder than to shallow it so under the plane would would be yes where you're still in a", "start": 38.7, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "right band you're not in left band the club is so far behind you 99 tons out of 100 the person wants to do this whereas and we're not saying that it has to be", "start": 47.16, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "off the chart Spectrum steep to shallow either no you know there's a spectrum within there within reason but definitely the preference would be to", "start": 55.44, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "have it go from more steep a smidge above the plane yes then under it so that in transition when we shift this", "start": 64.199, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "the forks get put on it when we shift the center of mass of this club yeah and the shaft is about a 90 degree to your spine angle will promote you to rotate", "start": 73.14, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "as hard as you want to and kick the energy Out to the Ball with a flatter spot at the bottom so let's just expand on that a little so if I swing this back here and I've got the shaft a little bit", "start": 81.659, "duration": 19.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "more vertical than the swing plane the torques that are applied when I begin to unwind naturally make that Chef want to", "start": 90.96, "duration": 15.238999999999999}
{"chunk": "do that as long as you don't pull the handle down yeah as long as I'm not putting an energy into it this way see that makes the club want to go that way", "start": 99.42, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "right but if if I'm putting a rotational energy into it so when my hands are connected like this and I'm putting this rotational energy into it the club wants to go that way it does and it's funny", "start": 106.86, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "because I find most students when I have them do left hand only because it's their non-dominant hand they have a hard", "start": 116.1, "duration": 15.358}
{"chunk": "time having this thing behind them here because it's heavy and they want to do this yeah but almost every single person that makes it relatively vertical when I", "start": 123.479, "duration": 18.782}
{"chunk": "say turn now the club does this every single time oh yeah and that's when the light bulb starts to come on yes so now we understand that", "start": 133.14, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "the torques that are put into that will make the club shell out as long as the geometry is lined up how we want it in the backswing now why would this make it", "start": 141.36, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "harder so if I've got the club the mass already more behind me what happens well if I took your right hand away exactly in this example That's Heavy and you", "start": 149.459, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "don't like it yeah it's on your shoulder you don't like it well the other thing is the torque that's applied is going kind of toward the golf ball well you can see that the center of mass is more", "start": 158.4, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "laid off than that in it so it wants to make the club kick this way and come exactly exactly and that tumbling Golf Club becomes kind of unstable it recall", "start": 167.16, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "becomes very sharp at the bottom almost like a V instead of a u and two uh you have no facing path to match so your timing jumping trying to square this", "start": 176.04, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "thing as fast as you can in a millisecond it's not going to work that's tough often won't work it's tough the only people I see it work for are players with really short back swings", "start": 185.7, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "yes if you have a short back swing you can probably I get away with having the club a little laid off if you have a really long big turn you could probably get away with it having", "start": 194.64, "duration": 18.901}
{"chunk": "it a little more across the line for most of us let's try to be kind of neutralish so somewhere if I swing to the top and I draw a line out of the", "start": 212.94, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "grip somewhere between my toe line and that ball line perfect would be kind of neutral yeah well Somewhere In a reasonable Spectrum to make it easier", "start": 232.92, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "okay turn so now we understand kind of what is creating the shallowing why is it advantageous to get that shaft kind of perpendicular to my spine here where", "start": 240.72, "duration": 20.399}
{"chunk": "it's 90 degrees well because the fastest way to two points is a straight line and at this point now that this thing is bisecting your spine the center mass is", "start": 251.04, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "behind you promoting you to rotate as as much as you want now the energy is being let out later instead of earlier", "start": 259.799, "duration": 16.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "and two you have a longer flat spot more stability within the face yeah so the farther that this gets away from", "start": 268.199, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "it's not moving out toward the ball if it's moving back this way as I transition now it gives me a lot of time I've got all day to turn and hit that", "start": 276.9, "duration": 20.160000000000004}
{"chunk": "golf ball 100 it also makes it really easy for me to have a reasonable path so now turning doesn't make me wipe", "start": 285.84, "duration": 19.74}
{"chunk": "across the ball where if the mass is going this way and I'm turning I'm going to cut across that golf ball yeah no when you're shallow you're", "start": 296.52, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "definitely have more of an inside path no doubt about that which also it gives you permission to rotate without throwing things out of whack yeah cool", "start": 305.58, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "it's interesting you watch every good baseball player there's a reason that almost all of them start relatively vertical yes so right typical hitter the", "start": 313.56, "duration": 19.381}
{"chunk": "barrel of the bat is you don't see many guys start with the Barrel in the plane that they're going to swing it in like this you see the", "start": 322.86, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "barrel go almost always as they're loading the barrel tips up this way so when they stride and land the barrel can go boom", "start": 330.66, "duration": 17.819}
{"chunk": "and become 90 degrees to your spine exactly then they can be very rotary and sling that thing that's right awesome well let's see if I can do one okay", "start": 339.78, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "let's see uh-oh first swing of the day first thing of the day we're gonna go slow I don't want to go to the hospital pretty good I did okay", "start": 348.0, "duration": 15.418}
{"chunk": "first thing in the morning I'll bet we see a little bit of that shaft I would imagine we do if I know you okay so hope you guys have liked this video please", "start": 371.12, "duration": 18.759999999999998}
