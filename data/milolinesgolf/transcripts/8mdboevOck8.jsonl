{"chunk": "use my turn to create the pullup on the grip to completely different shots a really nice exercise to train this idea is we're going to have the club", "start": 434.319, "duration": 18.598999999999997}
{"chunk": "loaded here and then we're going to use our turn to move the club around the corner", "start": 457.08, "duration": 17.079}

{"chunk": "correct way to train this without a golf ball is first put that club on the ground here and then we can use our turn", "start": 478.08, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "to move through and just really feel how we're creating a nice flat spot down at the bottom that's controlled by this pivoting action so", "start": 486.479, "duration": 19.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "again while many of you feel it's very powerful to really throw or pull with your hands and arms early out of the the top you're really depriving yourself of", "start": 496.879, "duration": 20.081}

{"chunk": "we're going to feel is my hands being towed and then it my body continuing to to pull on that grip up and left and you", "start": 533.519, "duration": 19.162}
{"chunk": "can see the Arc of the hands are going to take and it's all created by how my middle moves hope you like this video if you", "start": 544.64, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
