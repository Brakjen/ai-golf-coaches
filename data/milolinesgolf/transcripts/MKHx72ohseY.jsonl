{"chunk": "swing, it looks like he's got a fairly wide base. Yes, he does. So, he has a fairly wide base and then as he begins to move the", "start": 47.36, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "golf club, how does he move it, Ed? Well, initially what it looks like, he has a a a shift of pressure from his lead side to his trail side.", "start": 55.199, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "Yeah. Then he uses his legs as breaks as a byproduct of the width of stance, and his upper body starts to go first before", "start": 63.52, "duration": 19.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "his lower body starts to almost get pulled along. So, from a face on view like this, you'll actually see Rory has", "start": 72.799, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "a significant shift. He moves significantly to the right early. Yeah. He loads his pressure. Yep. So, he loads pressure. And now from", "start": 80.0, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "here, he goes and he winds his torso against his legs. Okay. Yep. Yep. He also has keeps his arc really wide.", "start": 88.96, "duration": 17.92}

{"chunk": "top of their back swings, I like to look at how much right arm bend they have. Mhm. And of anybody I've ever seen measured, Rory has the least amount of right arm", "start": 124.64, "duration": 15.681000000000001}

{"chunk": "ways cuz you have to be able to wind up a long ways to keep your arms long. Yep. And like we've always talked about that width is the key to rotation and", "start": 140.319, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "being shallow. Yes. And Rory definitely is exudes those things. He's got a very wide arc. the", "start": 148.72, "duration": 15.438999999999998}

{"chunk": "what Rory's doing. He's got that shift. He uses his body to wind up. His his hips don't turn a ton early. No. They get pulled along. His hips don't", "start": 164.64, "duration": 20.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "spin early. What does that help create? Well, it creates that shorten stretch cycle that we talked about or stretch", "start": 174.879, "duration": 15.442}
{"chunk": "shorten cycle as you like to change way of saying it. U because we know speed is created by the stretch you have in transition. The greater the stretch is", "start": 182.48, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "and the more you can push your lead hip away from the target for ro to cause your upper body to rotate. Yes. And so his his stretch cycle is", "start": 192.159, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "humongous. One of the one of the biggest if not the biggest we see out there. Yeah. He's a small guy who hits it about", "start": 201.76, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "as far as anybody on the tour. Yeah. So, and he has to maximize that stretch cycle so that he has that much", "start": 209.76, "duration": 15.519}

{"chunk": "wind winds. I can't even demonstrate it because my hips want to turn. They're too connected to my my my body. So, but", "start": 226.159, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "he winds his body like a massive amount and his hips don't have to turn that far. Yeah. Yeah. He can disassociate his", "start": 234.0, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "upper and lower a significant amount. Now, that does not mean that his hips do not turn. They do. Yes.", "start": 242.64, "duration": 16.078}
{"chunk": "But it's more a byproduct not because he's independently straightening this leg. It's because his upper body is turning, pulling this into a turn. So,", "start": 250.319, "duration": 21.041}
{"chunk": "his chest turning is bringing his hips along. Yes. Good. So, that's that's the key. We we want to make sure that people", "start": 260.4, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "understand you're not trying to rotate your your hips on the back swing. You're winding your body up and your hips come along as a result.", "start": 268.16, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "Yes. Okay. Although it's the reverse on the down swing. On the down swing. Yeah. Well, yeah. The sequence changes.", "start": 277.759, "duration": 17.842000000000002}
{"chunk": "So, we make this big wind up now. We land back left and we start to push this hip around behind us. And that", "start": 285.04, "duration": 16.96}

{"chunk": "Unwind as fast as I can get it to go. As far as you can get it. Yep. So the the sequence reverses itself. Yeah. From back swing to down swing. Mhm.", "start": 302.24, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "Cool. So let's review the keys to Rory's awesome back swing. Number one, it's a pressure shift to the right.", "start": 310.4, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "Now he's created some Now he's got a braking mechanism in his right leg. So he can wind his torso against that which pulls his hips along and then he's able", "start": 319.28, "duration": 18.719}
