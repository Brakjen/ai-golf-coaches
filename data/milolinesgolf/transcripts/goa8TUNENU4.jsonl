{"chunk": "dumping it dumping it back this way like this yeah so adduction so my body starts to unwind", "start": 18.24, "duration": 15.661}
{"chunk": "and this adducts and at the same time it's abducting it's also going to internally rotate", "start": 25.92, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "but you can do this at the house to kind of marry it all together today we're talking about a Hot Topic", "start": 33.8, "duration": 15.319}
{"chunk": "how to shallow that Golf Club we're going to talk about the good ways the right ways in our mind our preferences and the wrong ways to shallow the golf", "start": 46.739, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "club and we have four main ways that we like to see it done and they usually correlate they usually go together yeah it's a systematic so you if you get all", "start": 54.899, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "of them working together then you've got an explosive powerful golf swing let's start with some of the bad ones I think people want to see okay maybe I've been doing it wrong for a while and I I want", "start": 63.3, "duration": 18.779}
{"chunk": "to look at the the wrong ways to do it first so I haven't understand what I don't want to see in my golf swing okay so what not to do the number one way", "start": 72.299, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "that I see people try to shallow the golf club at least amateurs that are the struggle is through tilt tilting", "start": 80.58, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "okay so let's define tilt I think it's important we have videos on bending versus tilting I might tag that here it's important to to look at that", "start": 89.58, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "difference and how we see it because tilt we believe is more from the lumbar spine lumbar spine", "start": 98.46, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "so pelvis sliding forward and the whole upper Center a whole upper body tilting away so more of that old reverse K", "start": 106.799, "duration": 16.861}
{"chunk": "looking style you're going to see the pelvis this way chest back here so when that happens the upper Center ends up", "start": 115.86, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "over the top of the back foot yeah somewhat it does shallow at the golf club so you see that that Center Mass does", "start": 125.28, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "kick back a little to the right but it also does a whole bunch of you're no longer turning so your rotation got turned off when you do that and", "start": 134.459, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "more often than not the face gets pretty wonky here the face can get too open the path can be too far right and your low Point usually gets way behind the ball", "start": 142.68, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "so you're going to hit a lot of fats and fins so there tends to be a little bit more of a throw a Scoopy flippy to get that club to the", "start": 152.16, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "ball yeah so those players who suffer from this struggle with contact issues and then usually big pushes and hooks", "start": 159.48, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "and then usually combined with this tilt we see a slide to get to the ball so it's more of a pushing off the right", "start": 167.099, "duration": 16.980999999999998}
{"chunk": "foot getting to the left side that way to accompany that club getting thrown out a little bit more can it work sure", "start": 175.26, "duration": 15.780000000000001}
{"chunk": "there are players on tour who do it exactly yeah so but not our preference the other one I see is they try to shallow it with", "start": 184.2, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "their arms hands and arms dropping hands and arms dropping drastically so yeah so kind of into their right pocket", "start": 192.54, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "so you see people talk about sort of drop the hands then turn right but for the average golfer I I don't generally", "start": 201.12, "duration": 19.078}
{"chunk": "love to see a ton of arms yeah lowering like that in their swing and it's not always necessarily pulling", "start": 209.459, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "down or getting the hands you know moving them fast pulling down sometimes it's literally just them dropping it oh yeah I see it all that goes with a tilt", "start": 218.159, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "too A lot of times it goes together yep and so then they struggle with their low point at one point yeah so two things you're going to hear a lot face control", "start": 227.459, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "and low Point those are kind of two big factors and I think those two methods of shallowing it not necessarily the best", "start": 237.239, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "in our minds at least and the last one I see would be a lot of driving the trail arm forward yeah too", "start": 244.62, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "much and we have a good video on that that I'll tag as well a little bit of extra rotation I'm I can handle and I like it all right but a drastic that's", "start": 254.64, "duration": 19.62}
{"chunk": "in other sports that's bat drag it actually will cause premature extension so you're going to wind up early extending out of that to flick that club", "start": 264.3, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "squared back on the ball so sort of driving the hands to the ball or driving the elbow out in front", "start": 274.08, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "so then now the club almost gets in my opinion almost too shallow and open and open", "start": 281.58, "duration": 15.540000000000001}
{"chunk": "so now I gotta kind of turn on if I kept turning I'd miss the ball so I kind of have to put on the brakes rise a little bit and and sort of dump it down into the", "start": 290.1, "duration": 18.838}
{"chunk": "ball can it work sure I mean anything can work you can figure out how to time it Okay so we've kind of unraveled I say three there we got the tilt the driving", "start": 299.759, "duration": 18.721999999999998}
{"chunk": "the elbow and the DraStic low ring of the arm and the lowering of the arms okay so those are sort of three ways we see don't want to call them faults", "start": 309.06, "duration": 15.780000000000001}
{"chunk": "because obviously they can't work if matched up right they're just not match-ups the Tilt one generally don't like it all yeah the others you know we", "start": 316.74, "duration": 17.339}
{"chunk": "can figure out how to make those work somewhat yeah okay so let's go into our preferences on how to shallow the golf", "start": 326.1, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "club why don't we start with let's go back to that tilt one so how would we create a proper Bend instead of a tilt so if we've wound up our system", "start": 333.3, "duration": 18.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "correctly we've got some left Bend and now as I land and my pelvis starts to open now I'm into a right Bend so I've", "start": 341.82, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "already created all of the bends I need in my swing right there so now that is a shallowing Mech mechanism so if I do", "start": 351.96, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "that with a golf club in my hand I'm here and now I land I turn and I right Bend", "start": 359.46, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "yep and your chest is pretty much down the ball you got your buttons down at the ball it's pointing at the ball and it's not it hasn't fallen behind my", "start": 374.759, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "pelvis so when I do that pretty stacked up I'm stacked on top of myself when you get in right side Bend wouldn't you know", "start": 382.86, "duration": 19.019}
{"chunk": "the elbow kind of tracks with us in front that seam line anyways yeah versus when we tilt That Elbow is pretty easy for it to drop back behind or get kind", "start": 392.819, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "of lodged into our side tilt versus Bend we want to make sure we're bending properly and we're not sliding our pelvis out from under our", "start": 402.18, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "our chest too much yeah you've probably seen a hug drill very simple drill you can do right but you could almost create a little bit of this stand up and then", "start": 411.24, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "Loop so you go from exaggerating left Bend really feeling sort of steep to then dropping into right Bend and feeling a bit of that shallowing and I", "start": 419.52, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "like to use alignment sticks or a Long Rod and have people actually learn how to make this make a little circle when I do that", "start": 428.699, "duration": 18.221}
{"chunk": "you can see the tip of that's just making a little shallowing circle so that's shallowing it out but I'm not doing", "start": 440.16, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "dumping it dumping it back this way like this yeah Bend instead of tilt okay so now let's", "start": 447.3, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "talk about the arms so we talked about how you can use shoulder extension correct yep but", "start": 455.46, "duration": 15.659}
{"chunk": "now we're gonna instead use adduction and a little internal rotation yes so I'm just we're just speaking of the lead", "start": 462.539, "duration": 17.821}
{"chunk": "arm and shoulder so as I turn back here I could drop my arm like this and that's a shallower but my preference for more", "start": 471.24, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "speed and power would be to create a stretch so adduction so my body starts to unwind and this adducts and at the same time", "start": 480.96, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "it's abducting it's also going to internally rotate yeah so you see this in baseball players", "start": 490.139, "duration": 17.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "you see this in frisbee throwers let me get the distance on this one frisbee thrower wouldn't go down here wouldn't work no no", "start": 504.0, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "and anything where you're trying to create maximum rotational speed you're not going to have as much of a drop like that and this is more what you would", "start": 519.3, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "call your sling yeah right we're seeing with the guys who create the most speed create a nice stretch and internal rotation yep in that lead shoulder so", "start": 528.24, "duration": 18.659}
{"chunk": "the internal rotation so so here's the stretch so that kind of moves the hands may be a little deeper the", "start": 537.899, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "shaft a little deeper the club head a little deeper but then the internal rotation is really what kicks the shaft a little bit more shallow and then what", "start": 545.94, "duration": 17.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "that does to your right arm is your right arm will actually almost counter it a little bit and it might act yeah it'll", "start": 554.88, "duration": 16.618000000000002}
{"chunk": "and it'll actually move a little bit more in front of you that's how you get that right arm and and it also creates some Bend in your your rib so those", "start": 563.459, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "things are kind of all going together it's all big team effort they have to happen together and this I think transitions beautifully into a third", "start": 571.019, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "shallower we like to see and that's the right wrist extension blended with a little bit of that", "start": 580.32, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "forearm supination of the right arm yep right but if I if I do internal on the lead arm that's kind of happening a little bit anyways yeah so like we said", "start": 588.24, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "it's it's a team yeah so if you're doing them correctly when I go from Bend to bend and you can see my shoulder rotating and", "start": 596.519, "duration": 17.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "turning like a hitter yeah I'm getting all of these things for free it's all it's all one big break yeah they all", "start": 605.459, "duration": 15.419}
{"chunk": "happen together so it's not really you do one or the other when you do one you get the other yeah and which one do you need to focus on and that's the", "start": 612.779, "duration": 18.542}
{"chunk": "I don't know necessarily yeah because some people might feel things in their left arm their left wrist I like to feel you like to feel I know is more things", "start": 622.38, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "in your right wrist right hand because that's our dominant hand yeah so some people like to really feel like their left side's clearing out of the way", "start": 631.44, "duration": 16.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "that's more your your side I don't know sometimes I like right side feels that right side Bend kind of got to play it out right you got to figure out what", "start": 639.36, "duration": 17.700000000000003}
{"chunk": "feels produce the right motions for you yeah so Henry you just ran over and grabbed a visual aid so you can show people how these things tie together", "start": 648.06, "duration": 16.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "visual aid or just something on the driving range a bucket an alignment stick something you you had yeah I put an alignment stick through this bucket", "start": 656.7, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "here okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to get my golf posture I'm going to turn it up to the top and", "start": 665.279, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "basically get that shaft more or less pointed at ball line let me get actually on the this other alignment stick so it can see okay you can see that created", "start": 672.54, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "some nice left Bend you got your Trail side stretched up yeah my right arm is still on top of my left here because I haven't really folded my arms I haven't", "start": 681.42, "duration": 16.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "added any wrist conditions yet any elements this is more of just a drill exercise to feel this so I'm going to turn it up", "start": 689.279, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "and then to shower it out okay so I'm gonna get start moving into right side Bend so I'm going to feel a little crunch in my rib cage here yep okay then", "start": 696.959, "duration": 20.161}
{"chunk": "I'm gonna feel I'm gonna feel that left arm working a little bit more towards my pecs here", "start": 707.459, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "plus with a little internal so now I'm starting to marry those together now I'm going to add a little right wrist extension which is a little", "start": 715.56, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "more difficult with this bucket but same idea so now I'm really shallowing you see that that stick I can almost get to about parallel to the ground", "start": 724.62, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "so that would be like an exaggeration but you can do this at the house to kind of marry it all together", "start": 733.92, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "I also I'm kind of flexing into the ground too lowering a little bit natural and that lowering needs to happen to be able because you're creating some new", "start": 744.019, "duration": 15.94}
{"chunk": "angles that's going to help us get down to the ground am I just doing this all by itself or is there sort of a sequence to it that's", "start": 752.399, "duration": 18.779999999999998}
{"chunk": "kind of the last step I think ideally the sequence is the most important piece I want to see the club not start to", "start": 761.579, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "shallow until the transition starts to happen so I want it to stay stand stand pelvis starts to go first flexing into the", "start": 769.74, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "ground and that creates right Bend and it creates lead arm adduction and internal rotation so all those things happen because", "start": 778.019, "duration": 20.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "of the sequence ideally how about really nice and slow one where you kind of demonstrate that sequence with all those shallowers married together okay here we", "start": 787.019, "duration": 18.142}
