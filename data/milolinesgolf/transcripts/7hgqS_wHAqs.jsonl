{"chunk": "hey everybody welcome to my backyard i'm here with henry and we're going to talk about how you can make changes", "start": 0.16, "duration": 18.159000000000002}
{"chunk": "from home stepped away from the golf course today yeah we're no longer on the driving range we're no longer practicing", "start": 9.519, "duration": 15.001000000000001}
{"chunk": "at the golf course we're hitting into a net making changes in our own home environment and oftentimes", "start": 21.359, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "i find that some of the best changes happen here yeah because what happens when we're at the golf course or on the driving range", "start": 30.88, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "is we fall in love with where the ball is going and in this scenario we don't know where the ball is going", "start": 39.36, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "really we can kind of i could tell based on my feels where it's going to go but if i change a motor pattern it probably", "start": 46.559, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "changes where the ball is going to go but in hitting into a net is really desirable because it makes it so we're more interested in our pattern", "start": 54.48, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "than we are in what the ball does right right okay so often i see the best changes happen hitting into a screen or a net", "start": 63.44, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "and not really knowing where the ball is going at first so you're just changing how the thing looks you're making the pattern look more like what you want and then you go", "start": 72.72, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "outside and you hit a ball and you might be like oh baby that didn't go where i aimed it yeah but it looked right and then we've got to figure out how to get the alignment of the face and things", "start": 81.439, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "in in order but motion first is kind of what i'm after here well there's a couple of things we talk about on our", "start": 90.0, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "site our online academy and those two things are exaggeration and the speed of motion yeah two ways to", "start": 98.0, "duration": 16.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "really help you feel and ingrain new movement patterns yeah change is hard and if you swing it at full speed and", "start": 106.799, "duration": 17.442}
{"chunk": "expect it to look different it's probably not going to look different it's going to take some time at a slower rate of speed doing something", "start": 115.04, "duration": 18.959999999999997}
{"chunk": "probably slow and exaggerated at first to make it look different and then gradually adding a little bit of speed to it and still feeling the exaggerations and it'll start to look", "start": 124.0, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "a little better but it won't change that much because when you add speed your brain goes right back to what it's comfortable with", "start": 134.56, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "for sure so for our viewers at home they're looking to bring about a more rotational golf swing", "start": 142.56, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "less dependent on hands and arms right outside of joining our ll academy which we recommend but what's what are some", "start": 151.84, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "things they can sort of do at home to kind of slow things down and loop and learn these um movement patterns", "start": 161.12, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "well first thing i recommend is take your hands and arms completely out of the shop so you're going to learn how to apply the golf club", "start": 169.12, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "without using these guys okay we're taking this away for most of you it's going to be super uncomfortable it's going to feel very", "start": 178.159, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "awkward and difficult but it's necessary so i i take that as sort of like a almost like a limp arm swing where i'm", "start": 186.8, "duration": 19.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "just turning and turning the limp long arm swings you're just turning and turning and feeling your arms just staying away from you and", "start": 196.879, "duration": 16.002}
{"chunk": "okay let me try one here see if you now like that yep that's pretty good so did you apply the club to the ball feeling like it was all body no hands", "start": 203.68, "duration": 16.959999999999997}
{"chunk": "and arms it felt pretty rotary yeah i felt it felt like most of the motion was in my core how was that for like length", "start": 215.04, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "and speed it was pretty good starting off i might even slow it down a little bit okay so so you're gonna just you're gonna make a nice big turn and", "start": 223.76, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "you're gonna go slow enough so that the yeah now that one was money so to me like that that almost felt like the ball just got", "start": 231.68, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "in the way like i was almost just collecting it with my turn that's what we want okay so we're gonna really feel like you're collecting that ball with", "start": 240.239, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "just turn now when i thinned a little bit but should i who cares who cares okay was the pattern good did you feel like you just turned", "start": 248.08, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "just as good as the one before i just didn't hit it you didn't hit it solid yeah but the motion is what we're after motion first you'll make contact well if", "start": 260.479, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "you keep making the motion now it's really tough to hit a ball really solid when there's no levers involved because you're not creating very much downward attack angle so you're you're coming in", "start": 269.199, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "real shallow it's easy to hit thin or fat very yeah very around and level like that when you cut just a fraction", "start": 277.28, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "thick yeah but that's really nice okay so now so let's yeah let's say i'm feeling pretty comfortable about that motion", "start": 284.72, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "i've started to feel like you know my my setup feels pretty good i'm just kind of turning and turning how do i begin to build that up", "start": 294.08, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "well we start to add elements in so now once we've got a nice big turn that's propelling the golf club", "start": 304.08, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "now let's add in a little lever but that's let's not unload the lever so you're going to turn it back let your wrist set a little bit", "start": 312.16, "duration": 19.599}
{"chunk": "and then feel like you unwind your body you have to turn a lot farther than you're used to turning to get the club back to the ball okay if you're not used to rotating when you say", "start": 321.759, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "i'm assuming this this wrist you're talking about kind of setting it into extension yeah we're going to let that trail wrist extend like you're gonna throw a ball", "start": 331.52, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "so it's gonna turn back set and then we're gonna deliver the golf club with that set and you you said you don't really want this club passing", "start": 340.24, "duration": 17.601000000000003}
{"chunk": "my hands and arms i don't want this to unload at all you want this club getting back to the ball with that pivot", "start": 349.36, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "yep only the pivot so and it's going to be slow i want this ball to barely get into the net now what about like sort of tension i", "start": 357.84, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "mean am i still pretty limp or still fairly limp but you're we're we're actually manually holding this angle back for right now so", "start": 365.84, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "one of the big keys is the the velocity is going to be slow yeah i want the ball to go into that net barely really slow so i might just need a little more pressure in my fingers", "start": 375.28, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "okay i think i know what you're saying here okay that was awesome but you hit it into the net a little too fast a little too fast okay so even slower slow it", "start": 385.199, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "down i mean i want that ball to barely get into the net in the air yeah so that one i really i even tried", "start": 397.12, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "to feel a little bit of that like sort of squat and turn that you've talked about too well in order for you to apply the club to the ball if that angle's there", "start": 410.0, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "that's going to start showing up otherwise you're not going to hit it so i i mean i'm assuming if i was on a driving range that would have only gone to like the", "start": 418.96, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "end of the tee box like 20 yards yeah maybe a little more 25 30 yards but that's that's amazing how slow", "start": 426.72, "duration": 17.918}
{"chunk": "beautiful feel but i i do feel that so i'm starting to kind of", "start": 439.84, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "understand that sensation that you're trying to talk to us about on the site right for sure so that's that's that's basically what we're doing", "start": 447.44, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "with everybody is we're walking them through how to build this piece by piece yeah and then once we can do that then we", "start": 456.16, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "gradually start adding a little bit of velocity right so let's say so i have an 8 iron here i hit those 30", "start": 464.56, "duration": 16.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "40 yards so now let's hit it 50 yards same feeling still not unloading any levers pretty darn good", "start": 474.4, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "okay so i could just keep what's the word you use laddering that up yep until and now if i let's say i", "start": 485.759, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "start really miss hitting some which again when you're doing these movements you're going to miss hit some but let's say it gets pretty squirrely", "start": 493.84, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "and i feel like i've lost that feeling the focus of this exercise which is really feeling it right so what what would i do if i get to that", "start": 501.759, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "place where i'm hanging a lot farther and it's just not the same take the speed down so go back go back a couple steps go back two or", "start": 511.919, "duration": 17.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "three rungs on the ladder and see if you can find the feeling again and then start building it back up until it", "start": 520.08, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "breaks down again and then down gradually you'll be able to start going close to full speed so that's kind of like that old adage when you use like a", "start": 527.6, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "a training aid right where you do like 10 reps with it and then like five without it yep and then you kind of eventually start to offset", "start": 536.16, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "those numbers right exactly cool well i think this gives them a you know at least a look into um", "start": 545.04, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "how they can train at home using a net and a mat you know and even if you didn't have a net you can do or hitting balls you can do these exercises yeah", "start": 553.279, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "you can do them i almost always like to be hitting something so they make like birdie balls and foam balls anything that you can", "start": 562.399, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "apply the club to yeah and you want feedback so every so often you want to film yourself and see oh am i doing what i think i'm doing because most of the time when i see people", "start": 569.519, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "when people think they're doing what they're they're trying to do they'll look at it and be like oh wow yeah not even close well that's why we say a lot of people are trying to hit it too hard", "start": 578.08, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "when they're trying to oh yeah build the motion first so yep start slow exaggerate and don't be afraid to work from home you don't have to hit balls on the golf", "start": 585.76, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "course or at the range all the time exactly hey guys so i wanted to give you a sneak peek into milolionsgolf.com", "start": 594.48, "duration": 15.279}
