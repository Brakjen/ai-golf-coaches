{"chunk": "hey everybody milo here welcome back out to superstition mountain today we had a we had a couple really good questions from subscribers to the youtube channel", "start": 5.52, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "on getting that shaft lane that i'm becoming known for now there are some right ways and wrong", "start": 14.719, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "ways to go about that let's walk through the wrong ways what we don't actually want to do so when i'm swinging this golf club", "start": 23.199, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "i don't want to try to hold the angle and push the shaft forward if i do that i'm going to struggle with getting the face square i'm also going", "start": 32.16, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "to struggle with making any speed okay so what that would look like would be i would swing back here and then i would try to push my arms down in front of me", "start": 41.12, "duration": 18.718}
{"chunk": "to get that that shaft leaning forward most likely if you do that you're gonna hit it really low and off to the right the key to getting that", "start": 51.039, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "that awesome looking lean in the shaft is how our body turns so let's talk another game for just a minute", "start": 59.199, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "use my favorite one baseball so when i'm swinging a baseball bat and i arrive at at impact there's an angle between my left arm and", "start": 67.92, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "the shaft the reason that that's there is that i'm not throwing this i'm turning it", "start": 77.28, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "so you turn it to get that angle so our key here with this golf swing", "start": 85.52, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "is if i want to get this club to arrive at my desired impact position the only way i can get up to here like", "start": 93.84, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "this and have that face square and be able to use the levers to unwind with speed is to turn so i've gotta", "start": 102.32, "duration": 19.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "apply a rotational force that's what holds this angle for me i'm not actually physically holding the angle hopefully because if you are", "start": 112.079, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "you're not going to hit it very far so ideally that angle is being held by rotational forces okay", "start": 120.64, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "so it should look something like this that was a pretty good golf shot another thing to remember is", "start": 127.759, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "the thing that makes our pivot dynamic is the flow of our motion so we've got to get pressure flowing in the right order what", "start": 149.12, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "i also see from a lot of you trying to get that lean is your pressure is moving out of order", "start": 159.28, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "so we've we've got to make sure that the pressure in our feet and the way our mass flows is always preceding the motion of the golf club", "start": 166.879, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "so there's a little there's a little force to the left then to the right back to the left always ahead of the golf club and that", "start": 175.76, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "allows us to be able to keep turning and stay ahead of the club into impact so to recap a lot of you at home", "start": 184.4, "duration": 19.76}
{"chunk": "are trying to create this shaft lean with your hands and arms and that's not the optimal way to do it if we want to be as efficient as", "start": 194.08, "duration": 16.959999999999997}
{"chunk": "possible we need to have those dynamics created through physics and through our pivot so", "start": 203.04, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "we're turning the golf club and using angular momentum to sling the golf club we're not holding anything back but if we're doing it correctly", "start": 211.36, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "when we arrive at impact we've got this look we want so i hope that helps you all understand it if you'd like more information come", "start": 219.36, "duration": 18.079}
