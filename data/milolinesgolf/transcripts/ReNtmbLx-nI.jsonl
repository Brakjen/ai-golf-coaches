{"chunk": "so [Music] today i want to talk about a topic that", "start": 42.84, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "keeps coming up and that topic is how do we get into this proper impact position where the the handle is a little bit", "start": 51.039, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "forward we've got a little shaft lean our we don't look like we've slid so we're not we're not making contact off of our right leg like this", "start": 59.039, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "the other question that keeps coming up is what should our arms be doing in the golf swing and these two things go hand in hand", "start": 69.36, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "so today i want to talk a little bit about how our arms work in the golf swing so once we start down", "start": 77.119, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "what needs to happen now one of the biggest pitfalls i see happens right here in transition and", "start": 84.4, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "what this one is is as the player changes directions their body starts to move but their arm their trail arm right arm", "start": 93.52, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "or left arm stays back and when that happens you can see that there's a space right here through my my arm", "start": 102.32, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "if that happens there is no chance i'm going to make a good impact impact is going to look something like this", "start": 112.159, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "so what that player generally does is they have a lot of slide in their lower half because in order to get the the club up to the ball they have to", "start": 119.92, "duration": 19.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "move laterally along ways so how do we fix this problem that's the question you're all asking", "start": 129.52, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "now the the fix is related to the structure of the arms and the pivot of the body they have to work together as a team", "start": 138.08, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "so when i change directions my arms can't fall farther behind me what i want to have happen is i want my my right arm to move", "start": 147.12, "duration": 19.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "with me so this rotation moves my arms which accelerates the club we need them to work as a team so what i brought out here", "start": 156.56, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "i've brought a ball this is just a dodge ball from walmart cheap training it was like two bucks", "start": 165.84, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "if i put this between my arms it's a little restrictive for full swings but for less than full", "start": 175.36, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "swings it will teach you the idea of how you should move so this will teach you how your right", "start": 183.92, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "arm keeps up in transition if my right arm falls behind the ball falls out", "start": 192.4, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "so one of the best things you can do is start off hitting some small shots something like that with the ball", "start": 199.2, "duration": 15.918999999999999}
{"chunk": "between your arms it will teach you how to keep your arm sink to your body the next mistake i see players make when", "start": 208.319, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "it comes to trying to get shaft lean is i see players trying to move their arms up in front of them like this", "start": 217.519, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "if you're one of those players anytime you try to get the shaft to lean you probably shank it that's not much fun so you'll try it two", "start": 229.28, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "or three times and then you'll have a change of heart so if i'm not pulling my arms forward", "start": 239.12, "duration": 18.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "to get the handle forward how do i get it up there then now the answer to this question is we turn our arms up there", "start": 249.2, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "so what's happening is i'm pushing the left side of my pelvis around the corner back behind me like this", "start": 258.479, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "i'm not sliding laterally which is which would require me to throw the club at it to hit it i'm turning my arms if i'm able to do", "start": 267.68, "duration": 20.639}
{"chunk": "that impact will look something like this i'll get the handle up there which is", "start": 278.56, "duration": 15.758}
{"chunk": "what you see from the best players in the world they're not sliding laterally and throwing the head at it in this way", "start": 290.56, "duration": 20.401}
{"chunk": "like most of you are so let's hit one of these and see what it looks like in slow motion", "start": 299.28, "duration": 20.8}
