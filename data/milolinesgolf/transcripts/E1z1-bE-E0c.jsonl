{"chunk": "bombs kind of do that in baseball a little bit right kind of hit some line drives a little short ones work your way up yeah we did so it's a good pattern", "start": 29.4, "duration": 17.1}
{"chunk": "for your golf swing to sort of start slow start with shorter distances right sort of like flighting lead shots", "start": 37.32, "duration": 15.600000000000001}

{"chunk": "your ball in play let's start with this sort of this little I'm going to call it a bunt now obviously we're not hitting", "start": 60.719, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "shots like that that would be considered a bun right where you're kind of like this but we're gonna do sort of a condensed version", "start": 69.72, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "where we're just hitting some chip shots yeah it's just kind of slow motion let's put one on a tee here and I like to imagine my target line", "start": 78.36, "duration": 18.98}

{"chunk": "I see it's pretty wide motion I like with these little bunt drives too is sort of more of a it's coming through pretty level a lot of you guys struggle", "start": 104.939, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "with driver because you're you're hitting the ground you're trying to swing way up or you're swinging way down there's just too much chaos in this", "start": 113.759, "duration": 15.419999999999998}
{"chunk": "hitting area yeah I see people they're trying to hit up so they go this way yeah or I also see you know a lot of oh", "start": 121.079, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "pop fly City pop fly so this will just help you get nice and sort of shallow through the sitting area and the up part can be more created with our ball", "start": 128.039, "duration": 15.780000000000001}
{"chunk": "position and setup yeah and you might even make just a little rehearsal swing straight over the top of the ball yeah just to feel it level and then just", "start": 136.739, "duration": 19.159}
{"chunk": "clip it off the tee just gently I see a pretty wide pretty fluid motion how about we hit one with a little less unload so this site members would know", "start": 145.379, "duration": 16.22}
{"chunk": "this as foundation too this will be like an F2 driver for us we call this Foundation number two yeah so I'm going to load the lever system", "start": 161.4, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "and then just turn through and not unload it foreign so if you want to know more about our", "start": 170.459, "duration": 16.261}
{"chunk": "foundations obviously join our website that's our pitch for that one right yeah or those lower that would be more of I", "start": 178.319, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "would say the bunt one that was a good one no curve so now we're going to ladder it up a little bit more I want to see one you know past the red flag some more of", "start": 194.459, "duration": 17.66}
{"chunk": "that you know 200 range I would say 180 okay there so that'll just be a little bit more velocity do you want me to still", "start": 205.44, "duration": 16.021}

{"chunk": "bit Freer and I imagine I think now I'm going to start to see that ball go a little straighter maybe even cut a hair yep foreign there we go there's that", "start": 235.26, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "straight one straight with my driver at this speed it doesn't get in the air very much yeah but I like too like this", "start": 247.319, "duration": 16.301}
{"chunk": "sort of exercise you could hit the ball solid here you could probably hit it pretty solid here yeah you're not again there's there's little", "start": 256.019, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "to no chaos through the impact area the face is very stable and you're just sort of more or less sweeping it off the top would you say", "start": 263.88, "duration": 18.54}

{"chunk": "winding and unwinding that was a beauty there a one-yard fade that went about landed", "start": 282.18, "duration": 15.32}

{"chunk": "the sequence and the movements you want so I think it's time to probably add a little speed huh yeah we'll start let's let's start", "start": 302.34, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "putting a little bit of velocity into it there's a beauty right there why don't you just play that one all day that's kind of how I play only I hit it about", "start": 309.6, "duration": 17.779}
{"chunk": "40 yards farther 40 yards farther than that still went almost 300 yards now for this range with these new balls we're hitting that's probably all you can do but", "start": 322.44, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "because that was pretty close to the back deck back there yeah that was nice 290 in the air probably another good one", "start": 331.02, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "here we go we'll feed this one there it is that's my shot I'm assuming you got a pretty good awareness from that exercise of sort of", "start": 342.3, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "where the club is the how how the face was nice and square and stable and you were just turning through and sort of sweeping it off the top versus again adding", "start": 360.9, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "another element and some chaos at the bottom I'm trying to feel it as some the motion is simple and as few moving Parts", "start": 369.9, "duration": 15.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "as possible so when I'm moving slow all I'm really feeling is a winding and an unwinding of my body and a loading", "start": 377.46, "duration": 18.96}

{"chunk": "with hitting it high on the top of the face or maybe you're hitting it way on the bottom of the face you know getting this more of a sweeping action", "start": 404.52, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "sort of if I'm bunting these drivers then you can build up to the bombs and when you add speed you'll find more of that sweet spot more often because this", "start": 413.16, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "equates to distance too yeah actually a lot for me speed is Like Glue so if your motion is good speed actually makes the", "start": 421.5, "duration": 17.099}
{"chunk": "face and the head more stable as it swings around you and it's easy to hit the middle of the face when the club's moving slower I have a harder time hitting the center of the face", "start": 430.74, "duration": 18.659999999999997}
