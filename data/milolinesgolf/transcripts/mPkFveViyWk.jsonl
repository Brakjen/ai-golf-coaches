{"chunk": "hey everybody welcome back out to superstition mountain milo here along with henry and today we're going to do a quick lesson on shot shaping", "start": 0.16, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "not something we've talked about a ton on the channel so we figured it'd be something worth doing today and we want to make it really simple as basic as", "start": 8.48, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "possible for all of you [Music] so now henry what are some of the basics that you use", "start": 16.56, "duration": 18.531}
{"chunk": "for shaping shots club face and path those are my two focuses so pretty basic pretty simple yeah and which one dictates which", "start": 28.0, "duration": 17.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "well your face really determines start line mostly yeah something like that and it's more", "start": 37.12, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "on less lofted golf clubs and less on more lofty golf clubs it's kind of the tendency um but yeah so it's the face definitely", "start": 46.719, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "controls the majority of your start line okay now what do you do to make the ball curve well if i want to make it if i want to", "start": 55.12, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "make the ball curve right i'm actually going to make my path left okay i want to make the ball curve left i'm going to make my path out to the right", "start": 63.6, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "and how do you do that i just use body alignment so you do you aim the face and then you set your body and then you just swing where your body points yeah", "start": 71.68, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "now many of us are taught that you can do a lot of this with just your hands and arms which you can but to me it's not as precise and consistent", "start": 79.68, "duration": 19.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "and under pressure i'd rather just use my face and my alignment to uh to hit the shot i want to hit perfect i tend to agree with that that's kind of", "start": 89.759, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "how i hit most of my shots i use my setup to dictate the curve mostly i curve the ball left to right with my longer golf clubs", "start": 99.04, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "and the short ones go pretty straight unless somebody puts a tree in my way and then i will curve it but yeah that", "start": 106.64, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "tends to be the way to do it so let's see a couple here henry so i want to see you hit a couple of short irons and then i'm going to i'm going to work a couple balls with the driver okay so what shot shape do you want so", "start": 115.28, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "let's start i'mma call it i want to see a draw so i want this ball to start off you can see the people out in the", "start": 123.84, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "distance the three people that are close together yep started at them and draw it back over here oh blue flag or something yeah that would be a big draw but yeah that's", "start": 131.44, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "pretty big let's see that ball curve to the left and there we got it really bend and left it's going to land in line with the blue flag", "start": 139.52, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "so all i did there was aim my body right sort of out of those people and then i had the face about between them and the the flat so one thing i do a lot in", "start": 151.2, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "lessons is i'll use alignment sticks and i'll give designate one my face", "start": 161.519, "duration": 15.761000000000001}
{"chunk": "so this is the face alignment stick okay so that we're going to aim the face at our intended start line and then my curve alignment stick is", "start": 168.48, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "this one and i'm going to make it aim out there so now you're trying to get the face on that one and then your body lined up", "start": 179.44, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "kind of to the other one and then you're going to get kind of the equal amount of curve that we have difference in this angle so however", "start": 186.56, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "however much i make that to the right your ball is going to curve that much to the left right so if i made this a tighter dispersion here so that they're not nearly as", "start": 194.72, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "they're not nearly as different the ball is going to curve a lot less right yeah so let's see one curve less this time", "start": 203.84, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "and there we go that one's a nice tight little draw only drew probably five yards yeah and you see i'm not like adding some uh maneuver in here to", "start": 212.239, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "really make it draw or anything it's just i'm setting it up with face in my alignment my path okay now if you wanted to hit a little cutter we could start it on the same line", "start": 221.36, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "now this is our our path and so now you're going to align your your face still on that one but now your path more on the other one", "start": 230.08, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "okay now let's see if we can get that ball to fall right trying to fight the wind a little bit it's trying the right to left winds not helping you but it was definitely", "start": 240.959, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "trying to cut now if that was less loft that ball would have cut but because of how much down you hit on that is that a nine iron yeah all right it's hard to curve it to", "start": 252.159, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "the right yep so let's increase this make that super exaggerated okay so super exaggerated let the ball", "start": 261.12, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "be a little more forward in your stance this time so you don't hit down on it as much now we got a cutter that one's definitely", "start": 269.68, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "trying to go back to the right a bit so good shot yeah i mean there's a little bit you can add obviously you look at like tiger and some of the crazy shots", "start": 279.28, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "he's hit throughout the years now we're talking extremes though yeah falling shots to me you look at the best players in the world when they're keeping it in", "start": 287.84, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "play it's a pretty stock shot there's a little curvature to it and they pretty much have this window", "start": 295.52, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "very tight yeah so generally their path and their face are only a couple degrees difference which produces small curves yep i'll show you a driver oh baby", "start": 303.44, "duration": 20.64}
{"chunk": "okay it's all what you want to see what do we want first oh we don't want to hit it too far here", "start": 313.52, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "well i'll try not to smash it um why don't we start with a little hook a little low hook a little low hook so we're going to make this one bend a bit", "start": 322.32, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "yeah so we're going to have a big differential between those so that one's aimed out to the right my body's going to be lined up more to", "start": 330.8, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "the right now i can swing it along that line and that ball is going to sling that's a nice little draw right there", "start": 338.479, "duration": 15.441}
{"chunk": "you pull that out of the bag once once in a while i like that one no i don't like that shot that's only if the golf if the hole says", "start": 350.32, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "i have to do it pretty nice into a little headwind though yeah it's not bad huh so now we'll go back to stock", "start": 360.8, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "so my stock you'll see probably tighter than that yeah face is going to be this one and the path is going to be really tight", "start": 367.36, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "not much difference and that should make that ball just try to fall a little to the right so you can see my face there my body's", "start": 377.36, "duration": 15.918000000000001}
{"chunk": "lined up a little more to the left we got that ball turning right all right i did it first try that was pretty good yeah so i mean i guess our main message", "start": 384.639, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "here is a lot of you guys at home are trying to shape shots by you know slinging your arms over or trying to hold it off a lot like", "start": 398.08, "duration": 15.918}
{"chunk": "that's more like a specialty shots kind of like if you really need to go crazy but for the most part just stick to face and pass set it up like that", "start": 405.199, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "exactly get a little more structured in your approach but anyways if you guys like this video make sure to check out milolionsgolf.com", "start": 414.479, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "we have that online academy it's going great people love it giving monthly analysis there as well so check that out make sure you subscribe", "start": 423.039, "duration": 16.88}
