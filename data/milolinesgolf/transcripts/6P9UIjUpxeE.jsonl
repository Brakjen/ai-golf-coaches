{"chunk": "um generally at least with a lot of our students what we like to see them do is energize the golf club early in the backswing and what energizes the golf", "start": 136.319, "duration": 19.320999999999998}

{"chunk": "it as a I always talk about a swing you can't jerk a swing set around the swing comes up it's decelerating it's the entire Way to the Top", "start": 276.12, "duration": 17.159}

{"chunk": "and pushing them down and following the kids fly out of the swing set yeah I'm not sure that'll work out very well apply a lot of force from the top um", "start": 300.96, "duration": 17.46}

{"chunk": "think you measured my Tempo it was around like 18. you're 18 six you're fast so we you have the tour Tempo app yes this is a great app by the way you", "start": 318.84, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "guys should definitely download it so we can actually turn that on in a second but have you recorded your Tempo where are you kind of fall yeah I fall more on", "start": 327.479, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "the 21-7 so a slightly slower or longer swing but the ratio is still the same the ratio is the same I think that speaks a little bit to the sequence of", "start": 335.28, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "events is again in the same ballpark are we all exactly the same as they're a little more you know pull down the arms from some than others sure of course but", "start": 345.18, "duration": 18.779}
{"chunk": "like overall I would say the movement is still will would you say middle up generally generally speaking so when we", "start": 354.0, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "talk about Gathering towards the top I think it's important to point out that even though we're kind of chilled out up here kind of collecting ourselves in", "start": 362.52, "duration": 17.1}

{"chunk": "ahead and start changing direction you feel this whole like Spiral load up so all this energy is being like stored up in the system so that you can", "start": 388.56, "duration": 19.62}
{"chunk": "explode through the strike whereas if you've carried that all the way to this point yeah it's it's only going to Jet out early yeah right there's no other", "start": 397.68, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "option really that's a perfect way of putting it storing the energy so you're creating that stretch so then you can sling it later basically yeah I like how", "start": 406.319, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "Riley phrases it he says that you know this is our our wind up or our loading phase and then and that loading phase goes all the way until P5 we're still", "start": 415.02, "duration": 20.04}
{"chunk": "loading our system up I say we're I call it the wind up and the stretch so we wind ourselves up and then we stretch it", "start": 424.8, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "all out here and now we let it all explode out so even in a quicker player or a slower player that same appearance", "start": 433.139, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "I bet you'll if you slow it down you'll see it so all right let's take out the app and see if we can make some some tunes right okay sure we're talking what", "start": 442.319, "duration": 18.681}
{"chunk": "baby all right so now we're going to do a little face on work you're going to introduce me to the tour Tempo app and", "start": 451.58, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "make some are we calling them whoops [Music] yeah woo-woos and again that's a that's a shout out to Luke bracky that's uh one", "start": 459.0, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "of his isms but yeah we're gonna introduce some woo-woo we're gonna make some sound right yeah let's do it talk me through this app so with the sound", "start": 469.08, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "we're trying to make sort of a consistent tempo right yeah um so if you look at this app I think we", "start": 478.199, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "figured out that Henry is about an 18-6 Tempo so the way this app works is it operates on a ratio all the ratios are", "start": 485.759, "duration": 15.301}
{"chunk": "three to one so there's three beats so when I go ahead and start playing this thing I don't know if the mic will pick it up or not but probably will it will so yeah there's three beats the first", "start": 493.68, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "beat being the start of your backswing the second beat being the set of the golf club in the backswing and the third", "start": 503.46, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "beat being impact okay this somewhat translates into woo-woo but woo-woo is kind of a different concept altogether well the woo-woo what", "start": 511.8, "duration": 16.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "you were telling me is about energy inputs right correct so we can kind of describe it as almost the first and the second point in the app right where the", "start": 520.56, "duration": 18.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "first point would be energizing almost gonna be a little different because the set you don't energize the club in the set on the downswing in in between in", "start": 529.62, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "between two and three really so like the the first the first Wu is is all the way from about P1 to about P3 ish okay yep", "start": 538.38, "duration": 19.139000000000003}
{"chunk": "right and then because there's energy in the golf club from that point the club will keep floating up to Coast all the way up to the top yeah and like the", "start": 548.459, "duration": 16.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "swing set that you that you always talk about right cos up to the top and then as we go ahead and add some drop or fall", "start": 556.92, "duration": 15.059}
{"chunk": "re-centering those combination of moves here in transition it's still coasting and then the second woo begins to happen", "start": 564.18, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "after transition and through the strike okay so it's a little bit different than the second one basically carries you almost to impact sure yeah all the way", "start": 572.459, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "past impact you're pouring gas all the way through impact is that yeah kinda yeah all right well let's try this app out", "start": 580.86, "duration": 18.5}
{"chunk": "we're on 18-6 yeah a little bit we'll talk about that first woo then for the most part okay because I want that to carry me", "start": 589.98, "duration": 20.14}
{"chunk": "to the top yeah essentially all the way through the top and into transition so that re-centering that we talked about in you know the rib Sway and the sacrum", "start": 599.88, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "move video okay so in the back this is one of my favorite ones to do I think you do this too you commented on one of my videos with it if we go ahead and visualize this first area as like", "start": 609.839, "duration": 19.321}
{"chunk": "energies in the golf club early so we toss this thing up right well you probably people have watched our Channel have seen that before we've done a lot", "start": 619.32, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "of that absolutely yeah energizing it so if you put your shaft there again so I to do that I'm feeling you push it too but I'm also feeling a little pressure", "start": 628.68, "duration": 19.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "shift a little bit of that rib sway that you guys talk about so that my Center Mass is just moving a little right here right to get that club going up and back", "start": 638.1, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "into my backswing so that's that first that's the first one right and then it's really chilling out all the way from", "start": 647.88, "duration": 15.179}
{"chunk": "that from where the club starts losing energy and and floating to the top it's chilling all the way until about P5 okay", "start": 655.019, "duration": 17.661}
{"chunk": "and that's when you would start re-energizing the golf club and that's where you'd feel the second woo begin and like Milo says the gas is poured all", "start": 664.68, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "the way through the strike at that point if you've ever ridden one of those uh pirate ship things that have the wheel", "start": 672.48, "duration": 16.019000000000002}
{"chunk": "under them so they go and get you going and then you start coming down and oh yes yes yeah yeah that's a good Vision what's that weightless feeling it's just", "start": 680.459, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "like being a roller coaster you kind of get up to the top and it's like oh and then back down yeah that's that's what we're saying right exactly okay so run", "start": 688.8, "duration": 18.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "this app again so I get I'm gonna make some practice okay kind of go with it because I gotta get tuned to this oh okay", "start": 698.04, "duration": 20.561}
{"chunk": "[Music] oh that looks that was close to one time yeah it's pretty close to me yeah okay", "start": 708.74, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "hit one see if that feels like your timing you might even be slightly quicker than this [Music] yeah a little quicker yep", "start": 719.1, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "so I'm quicker than that you might be 15-5 great that's long drive fast", "start": 728.22, "duration": 15.5}
{"chunk": "so I really gotta feel like I'm moving too if I'm gonna time this absolutely you were early", "start": 735.98, "duration": 18.63}
{"chunk": "[Music] that's closer yeah you really might be like a 15-5 huh", "start": 744.41, "duration": 21.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "[Music] thank you how'd that one feel that was pretty good", "start": 754.63, "duration": 15.850999999999999}
{"chunk": "I tried to like that was more synced up to it you gotta take some energy out at first to kind of like time it you know so", "start": 765.839, "duration": 17.578999999999997}
{"chunk": "that's why I'm trying to even if you probably see on camera my movements and my my trigger I'm trying to just slow it down here so I can match it to that I", "start": 774.839, "duration": 18.06}
{"chunk": "think this might actually be really good practice for him to learn how to just take the energy out at the top because he's got so much energy in there", "start": 784.139, "duration": 15.431999999999999}
{"chunk": "[Music] so that's probably that's probably her felt a little smoother from the top would you say yep and", "start": 790.75, "duration": 17.329}
{"chunk": "you've asked why your head backs out because you put energy in too soon oh you're up we're putting you on now okay sounds cool so what are we gonna", "start": 800.459, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "put you at I'm more at like a 21-7 so I'm a little bit slower than yours so yeah so I'm going right in front of this", "start": 809.459, "duration": 18.020999999999997}
{"chunk": "little line again sure [Music]", "start": 817.26, "duration": 21.47}
{"chunk": "now you can see he practices with it because you see how like the rehearsal and the practice swings like matched it like yeah right away", "start": 836.76, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "yeah third click you actually it was pretty close to it right you rehearsed it down to impact with that in your practice Yeah so show that one more time", "start": 845.339, "duration": 16.621}
{"chunk": "yeah so I kind of just split it up into three pieces so the first piece being that initial woo the second piece being", "start": 853.92, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "this set and re-center the third piece being unloading into the strike so one two three", "start": 861.3, "duration": 15.78}

{"chunk": "really snatchy or hitchy or adding a lot of extra unnecessary Force like I do this is a really probably a good", "start": 879.48, "duration": 15.18}

{"chunk": "play too they're never going at anything full gas like you don't see like this rapid change of Direction they just look flowed out for lack of a better way", "start": 896.22, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "right even if they're Swinging with a faster Tempo even so yes it might be more like whoosh whoosh whoosh I mean they're they're just so smooth totally", "start": 904.44, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "at that speed so so I think that's an important one for for anyone I mean you can't overstate the importance of Rhythm and Tempo and that's why you know that's", "start": 913.68, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "why you hear it so often oh you just got quick there right obviously there's other things that go into making a good golf swing but like good Rhythm solves a", "start": 922.8, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "lot of them I think the real Crux of this and the key to it is inputting the power at the proper points in time yes if we're if we continue to input power", "start": 930.72, "duration": 19.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "too long then we have to input power too soon in the transition and things get jerky looking and it's just doesn't look right yeah so that's like probably the", "start": 940.68, "duration": 16.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "most major one that we see in common right is Just Energy too long in the backswing causing a too rapid of a change in Direction any other super", "start": 949.199, "duration": 18.301000000000002}
{"chunk": "common ones that you see in terms of missteps in this area way too slow going away so I see really common no energy", "start": 958.56, "duration": 17.879}
{"chunk": "it's like there's no energy no energy no energy no energy and now they're like oh shoot I got to put some energy into this thing and it all blows up totally", "start": 966.959, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "energize it early that can be a good thing for yeah for people energize it early maybe that's the title of this video energize it early chill it chill", "start": 976.139, "duration": 16.401}
