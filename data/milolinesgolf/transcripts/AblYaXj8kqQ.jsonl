{"chunk": "He she could not stretch it because her shoulder was going up and then she was getting dumpy. And then from here on the normal one, the way we were talking to", "start": 0.16, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "her about it is that she landed left. This created this dynamic stretch to then let that thing sling off you and around the corner. [music]", "start": 7.759, "duration": 16.732000000000003}
{"chunk": "So Ed, what we're talking about here is the way our upper center moves. And the upper center in the golf swing moves", "start": 19.439, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "kind of like a fish hook as we swing. So, I'm just going to walk everybody through what's kind of going on. I'll do", "start": 26.8, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "it from face on. So, as I'm making a back swing, what's happening with my upper center? Well, first off, what is my upper center? Where's that that point", "start": 34.88, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "in space from the waist up? That's kind of the the middle of my my center mass here. And it's actually the center like right where my sternum", "start": 42.399, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "is, but it's in the middle of my center of mass. So, it's someplace in the middle of me. Now, as I'm moving, as I start off the ball, where does this", "start": 51.92, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "center of mass go? Well, initially it starts to go right. Okay, [clears throat] legs create uh create a breaking mechanism which create rotation.", "start": 61.44, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "You land left. It actually goes with you as it counterbalances the weight of the club. And probably right about then you start to push back and that's your fish hook.", "start": 69.439, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "Well, we've just explained it. The video is done. So, what's happening here is as I swing", "start": 78.88, "duration": 15.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "the club back, I move a little to the right. I stabilize with my legs. I start to fall back left. So, I go", "start": 86.64, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "right and then I go back left to get the energy into the golf club. I'm So, I'm start this way. Now, in order to unload", "start": 94.079, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "everything, I've got to push up, back, and away like this. Correct. If I just stayed in this posture like this forever with my my butt behind my", "start": 103.52, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "my chest, would I be able to No, you'd be able to do nothing. I wouldn't be able to get the energy out into the golf club. Right. Correct.", "start": 112.72, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "So, at some point in time, I have to push up back in a way. use my I'm using a lot of different muscles. Using this", "start": 121.439, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "left leg, I'm using the obliques up the left side, the lats most likely", "start": 130.64, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "like this to create a spiral up the front side. Correct. And what's the effect that that has on the golf club? Creates energy. Yes.", "start": 137.68, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "And keeps it on plane. So I I think it it gets rid of the energy. Yeah. So we've created the energy here. We've got all this potential energy. Now I'm", "start": 146.4, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "going to get rid of it. Right. Right. And it keeps the club on plane up the front side. We are going to use this ball to demonstrate or show kind of", "start": 155.04, "duration": 20.48}
{"chunk": "where my middle is going as I swing. So I'm going to go into my little rocking trigger turn. So you can see how this", "start": 165.12, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "spiraled up this way. Now it comes down and now it spirals around behind me. And you can see my my head actually", "start": 173.04, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "wanders a little forward in transition and then pushes up and back through the bottom of the swing. The thing to note", "start": 182.0, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "is that even though your upper center is moving back this way, the upper center is still not getting outside that lead hip. No,", "start": 189.76, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "no, it's actually staying inside that lead hip. So that when you land and now you push away this direction, it starts to fish hook this direction.", "start": 197.84, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "Yes. It's inside of both hips. So on the back swing it doesn't get outside of the right hip and on the down swing it doesn't get outside of the the left hip. Right. Correct.", "start": 205.44, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "But it does one thing. It does get behind the lower center. So the lower center is the center of my pelvis. Correct. So it gets behind the lower center and", "start": 213.76, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "then it gets ahead of the lower center and then it goes back behind the lower center again. Well, that's primarily because your your lower half is only", "start": 223.28, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "turning roughly say 45ish maybe and then this is at 90. Yeah. So there has to be some catch up. Uhhuh. So that only makes sense.", "start": 231.76, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "Yep. And then in transition when my pelvis starts to unwind me, my chest actually stays closed, relatively speaking.", "start": 240.4, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "So let's say I make a 45\u00b0 differential. That stays for a little bit, but then about P5ish, so left arm parallel, now my", "start": 248.08, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "chest starts to go and it it catches up and it actually gets back ahead. And that's part of why we wind up with our upper center behind our lower center", "start": 257.12, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "through the strike. Right? I've got a gears video here just to show you using a couple of major champions how their upper center moves relative to", "start": 267.36, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "their lower center. How they actually get their their chest a little off the ball farther than their pelvis in the back swing as Ed said because it turns", "start": 276.72, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "more and then it gets back slightly in front or right on top of the pelvis in the transition. So when their hips are square, their chest is actually slightly", "start": 284.24, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "forward of their pelvis and then it works backward again. And that's how they get all the energy out into that golf club for maximum speed.", "start": 293.44, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "Woo! [music] [music] Let's walk through a couple of exercises that we can do to gain the feel for how", "start": 329.28, "duration": 15.136999999999999}
{"chunk": "to to move our centers. I would say the first exercise would just be to start to add some flow into your motion and feel how you shift off the ball and how you", "start": 350.72, "duration": 20.161}
{"chunk": "land back to the left with your chest still a little closed but your knees back more or less square with flexing them. If we can do that now, we're", "start": 361.36, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "starting to get ourselves stacked up correctly so we can use the force to fish hook the upper center correctly.", "start": 369.6, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "Correct. Yeah. Exactly. And so I'm a big fan of feeling how to float into transition here and land", "start": 378.08, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "properly because most people are going to have a tendency to go this way right away in the down swing. Yeah. That's funny cuz we just gave a lesson to a student about that exact", "start": 387.039, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "same thing. And one, not just a student, a a tour player student, a tour player student. The other thing is is that because", "start": 396.0, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "as she got the student got to the top, go to the top, please. In transition, he created this stretch as he lands left.", "start": 404.08, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "It creates this stretch. He she could not stretch it because her shoulder was going up and then she was getting dumpy. And then from here on the normal one,", "start": 412.56, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "the way we were talking to her about it is as she landed left, just created this dynamic stretch to then let that thing sling off you and around the corner. So", "start": 420.88, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "for her, it felt like this shoulder had to get closer to this hip in the transition. Exactly. Which gets the chest back on top of the pelvis or even slightly in front of it.", "start": 429.44, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "Right. Then you can get the energy to spit out properly where if you go this way, the energy is spitting out back here, not through the ball.", "start": 438.639, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "Correct. Exactly. And that was the key for her. Even though she felt as if this was getting closer in transition, it really wasn't. It was just staying", "start": 446.56, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "level, offsetting her desire to do this. It was actually staying level and then she could turn it around the corner.", "start": 455.52, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "So, let's show you one example. See if I can make my body move in this way where I land back to the left and then get my", "start": 463.68, "duration": 17.158}
{"chunk": "my upper center to make that fish hook. I think I did. Okay. So, if you like this video, please subscribe to the channel. You can find", "start": 471.039, "duration": 17.921}
