{"chunk": "extension will actually come out generally doesn't necessarily mean it goes to bow but it's going to come out some amount because if they left it like this and", "start": 225.04, "duration": 17.759999999999998}

{"chunk": "okay and coming into impact and like we just said this you're gonna come into a little bit more of this wrist raising up a little bit just a little bit", "start": 415.12, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "more ulna too maybe just slightly yeah it's going to go a little more older it's going to go so it goes radial and ulna versus going", "start": 424.72, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "into so much yeah flex yeah so then it comes in like this and it's almost like a hammering action we talked about right where you release and then it and then", "start": 433.44, "duration": 19.121}
{"chunk": "if anything after impact it starts to recup or re-extend right and that helps stabilize the face as well it helps stabilize it and helps", "start": 444.0, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "keep it from turning down so for you guys at home that have this more neutral strong grip and then you try to bow it down look what that does to my forearm", "start": 452.88, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "right look what that does to the club face and then if you go up you know up and around the corner and you continue to do that", "start": 461.919, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "i mean it's pretty much hook city from there that's a match up and it works with certain grips but not all of them so", "start": 469.68, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "know your grip know your match up and you'll be able to make the right choices in what you're trying to do okay so let's wrap this up by going back to", "start": 476.96, "duration": 18.718}
