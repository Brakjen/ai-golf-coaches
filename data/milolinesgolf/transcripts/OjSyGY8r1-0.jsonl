{"chunk": "the angle that I have from this Trail forearm and the shaft I'm going to maintain that because of a slow rate of", "start": 0.0, "duration": 15.179}
{"chunk": "rotation in the ribs so now when I do that slowly I've got way more lean in the shaft than I would if this is rotating with a heck of a lot more speed", "start": 7.62, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "more energy and it throws all the energy out through the arms through the golf club again Center Mass above so I'm going to move close ball back and smooth", "start": 16.26, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "rate of rotation so you can hold the load and that golf ball came out at like eight degrees hey guys back out here today with Elite", "start": 25.56, "duration": 19.078999999999997}
{"chunk": "and Riley and we are talking about trajectory today traged baby and you mentioned that there's four main ways that you see people control trajectory", "start": 39.48, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "so let's walk through those and demonstrate them absolutely well why don't we start with this why don't you hit some balls here Milo oh you want to", "start": 47.94, "duration": 15.300999999999998}
{"chunk": "see me do it oh yeah so let's just go stock to start okay so let's just go straight stock a straight stock shot", "start": 55.32, "duration": 15.359000000000002}
{"chunk": "just a stock shot like a range swing right here nothing crazy awesome okay now first way let's go ahead and", "start": 63.059, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "set up to it again just like like you normally would for a stalker so the first thing we're going to do is get your belly button or just your General", "start": 72.299, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "Center of mass closer or more up on top of the golf ball good and a lot of players will then have to choke out choke it up to go ahead and create there you go perfect so let's go ahead and hit", "start": 79.32, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "another one from right there so generally speaking if the center of mass in our body gets more over the top of the golf ball it stands the shaft up", "start": 88.38, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "more so now we're on a steeper plane and I use that a lot in chipping if I want to hit more of a low Runner I move really close get the ball close to my feet perfect that's a great way to do it", "start": 97.56, "duration": 16.739}
{"chunk": "exactly okay so as long as we're going on this low type of look and now let's go ahead and put the golf ball just one ball length", "start": 105.299, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "back of your Center there you go perfect a little farther back yep exactly same swing there we go now doing that you were saying before how you don't really", "start": 114.84, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "like to do that and why because it makes the ball hook makes the ball hook why does it make the ball hook because my pass more into out because I'm hitting more down exactly and yeah so it", "start": 123.36, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "steepens up your angle attack as well so just things to be warned about as well okay now the next one just general rate of energy", "start": 131.28, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "yes right there slow things down the ball is going to come out lower that's exactly right so let's see one that just has Tempo down just slightly", "start": 140.22, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "beautiful so the ball came down slightly yeah okay now what club do you have seven iron okay this is a really complex one there's a six iron for you low rate", "start": 151.08, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "of energy as well so now I need to lower the rate of energy to hit it the distance that that one's supposed to there you go exactly yeah that's a way to do it exactly", "start": 159.9, "duration": 17.099}
{"chunk": "thank you now what is like I think that's a really important piece too because when folks are planning wind", "start": 168.239, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "I see it a lot when I'm coaching somebody on the golf course that if it's blowing even you know five miles an hour it's nothing what they're trying to do", "start": 176.76, "duration": 17.18}
{"chunk": "is Juice It Up more to fight the wind and get it through the wind and in reality what that does is it puts more spin on the golf ball makes that wind", "start": 184.22, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "affect that ball more exactly and they just come up either shorter or more sideways 100 right or I'll see this too where somebody is hit it in a position", "start": 192.9, "duration": 17.398}
{"chunk": "where they have to flatten it out like there's a tree limb or a cactus limb here in Arizona and they have to hit it underneath it and all they try to do is", "start": 201.959, "duration": 15.482}
{"chunk": "still take the same club and just shove the handle forward and it's still going to unload because you have so much energy in it so what do they end up doing just throwing it straight into the", "start": 209.28, "duration": 19.019000000000002}
{"chunk": "tree or into the cabinets so it's really important to just understand generally to control your golf ball you need to", "start": 218.4, "duration": 15.661}
{"chunk": "understand how to do it using these different methods right rather than just trying to affect the golf ball with the same golf club that's hugely important", "start": 226.5, "duration": 17.038}
{"chunk": "so which ones have we gone through so far we moved closer to the ball Center Mass closer yep ball position back ball position farther back yep less energy", "start": 235.379, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "less energy now this is really interesting as well we'll stop on that one for just a second because we hear about this with driver a lot we want the", "start": 243.72, "duration": 15.658999999999999}
{"chunk": "ball to launch high and spin low well with wedges we want it to launch low and spin High well if you go at a wedge hard", "start": 251.099, "duration": 15.122}
{"chunk": "that golf ball is going to jump usually jumps high and it Knuckles yep knuckling meaning that it doesn't have it's not as much spin so what's interesting is you", "start": 258.84, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "can actually have especially on wedges lower swing speed and hit the golf ball further than somebody that has higher swings if you", "start": 268.919, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "use flatter trajectory because you used flatter trajectory and still granted that the ball comes out of the middle of the face but in essence we're we're changing the dynamical off to the golf", "start": 277.38, "duration": 18.599000000000004}
{"chunk": "club so somebody that has say a swing speed of 80 miles an hour on a sand wedge and that golf ball goes say", "start": 286.139, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "90 yards and somebody that comes in with a 75 mile an hour golf or swing speed can hit that golf ball even further than that which is really interesting and", "start": 294.78, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "that's kind of a mind trip right but you're changing the dynamic Loft it's all about Dynamic Loft exactly so one thing too on that note is how much", "start": 303.6, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "energy your ribs have meaning the rate of rotation that they have or the energy level that they have is going to transmit that energy into the arms into", "start": 313.74, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "the hands and then obviously into the golf club the more energy the ribs have here the more it's going to shoot the energy out of the golf club and now we have higher", "start": 321.6, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "Loft higher higher trash higher vertical launch right so if we do that again Milo let's just hit two shots here one again", "start": 330.539, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "go ahead and show stock okay so I'm just going to hit a stock so we're going stock again so stock energy in the ribs is what we're focused on here", "start": 338.94, "duration": 18.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "beautiful that was just so Good by the way okay so now let's go with this and this is more or less the picture that once you get into this like fully loaded", "start": 347.419, "duration": 19.001}
{"chunk": "position here the angle that I have from this Trail forearm and the shaft I'm going to maintain that because of a slow", "start": 357.24, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "rate of rotation in the ribs so now when I do that slowly I've got way more lean in the shaft than I would if this is rotating with a heck of a lot more speed", "start": 365.28, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "more energy and it throws all the energy out through the arms through the golf club again okay so that's the picture is the once you go into this loaded phase", "start": 374.88, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "your main that's it so the Raider rotation the ribs is chilled beautiful so now we got the trash down probably what would you say three four", "start": 382.44, "duration": 19.319}
{"chunk": "degrees at least that much at least that much and that translated into like actual height the first one was probably up at like 90 maybe 95 and that one", "start": 392.039, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "looks just eye test like 70. that's substantial it's a lot lower exactly so and I think this is like when we talk about controlling the golf ball it's far", "start": 401.699, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "more important to be able to control your trajectory rather than the curvature that the golf ball has like you don't need to hit a draw and a cut you need to be able to hit these windows", "start": 411.479, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "you need to be able to high low and just hit your stock shot exactly with all those different trajectories sweet trash control baby a lot that goes into it we", "start": 419.46, "duration": 16.381}
{"chunk": "have a few variables we can change ball position both back and away from or closer to ourselves yep and then we can vary how much energy input we put into", "start": 427.68, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "it yep and that can vary the trajectory and the spin exactly exactly what's really nice is you can do a lot of that before you even start swinging so the", "start": 435.96, "duration": 17.218}
{"chunk": "only thing that you're really doing is just managing energy right so if I get like and and what's cool too is if you add all of these different layers on top", "start": 445.139, "duration": 17.101}
{"chunk": "of it so if I go Center a mass above ball position back more golf club now I can really fly let's hit one like that", "start": 453.479, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "this is like Stinger Central now right so Center Mass above so I'm going to move close ball back", "start": 462.18, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "and smooth radio rotation so you can hold the load and that golf ball came out at like eight degrees", "start": 469.139, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "that's so cool but what's also really cool with this is it actually makes your practice time engaging yeah because now you can actually hit different shots and", "start": 478.86, "duration": 16.261}
{"chunk": "you see it all the time every single person that goes to a driving range is just trying to hit this perfect magical perfect shot when there's endless", "start": 487.56, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "amounts of shots to be had right how often do you hit just the magical perfect shot how often do you have the exact Club you're going to hit to a", "start": 495.0, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "given shot I mean if I'm talking about my my own personal game Driver I'm hitting pretty much stock I got like two", "start": 503.819, "duration": 17.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "shots right I have like stock and then some amount of like squeeze cut depending on how nervous I am or how you know it just calls for it sometimes tight Fairway win conditions whatever", "start": 512.7, "duration": 19.58}
{"chunk": "but then you every single time when you go out and play you're always presented with wind into balls below your feet all", "start": 522.08, "duration": 15.277999999999999}
{"chunk": "these different conditions and you better be able to understand how to manage how far you're going to throw that golf ball yeah for sure different pin locations ball pin in the back of", "start": 530.339, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "the green Trouble behind you don't want to fly it all the way back there you want to bounce it in exactly that that's what makes that's what takes somebody from a good player to a great player", "start": 538.08, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "really quick is their ability to control it because now you're controlling your golf ball at a really high level for sure so yeah just talked about trajectory", "start": 546.06, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "control um super important again just to review uh Center of mass closer ball position back these are all like for lower lower", "start": 555.12, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "launching if you want to hit a higher you're just doing the opposite of this but Center Mass closer ball gets back energy level gets lower obviously you", "start": 563.22, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "can you can change your Club just depending on what type of trash or window you want to throw it to or throw it through but that gives you the", "start": 570.899, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "opportunity at least to actually hit quality shots in all conditions and control your golf ball at a really high level awesome Milo again thanks so much", "start": 578.7, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "for everything man that was a blast thanks for talking about we had a good time hopefully you guys like this as well if you did hit the like button subscribe come visit the guys at Elite", "start": 586.44, "duration": 19.079}
