{"chunk": "are yes the hands are to the right of the midline but that club is well to the right of him it's trailing him he's", "start": 9.559, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "circling the corner he's not he's not having that club in his hands cross him so much the first thing we're going to do", "start": 17.16, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "do Milo if you want to pull up your coach now let me share my screen we figured we'd have some fun and take a look at the most recent major Champion", "start": 30.08, "duration": 19.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "swing and some of the changes he's made and that's Xander scha well that's pretty money so this one I believe was at the PGA this was at the PGA that's", "start": 39.64, "duration": 19.997999999999998}
{"chunk": "during the practice round yeah I think I want to say Luke Kuran took that one not the not perfect camera angle but pretty", "start": 49.719, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "close let's watch that one more time at full speed that was just a little Cy hit right there just looking at", "start": 57.879, "duration": 18.841}

{"chunk": "Xander start him at a dress you see that little trigger he had a little little motion first you see his", "start": 74.96, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "knees moving and then he starts winding up Club gets a little inside the hands but", "start": 83.64, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "not much base stays pretty much square to spine angle maybe even slightly more shut than that so I'm going to do my normal lines here we boxed him", "start": 92.0, "duration": 21.039}
{"chunk": "in got a little elbow plane line there you can see it left arm parallel he's pretty much pointed at the ball maybe just outside the ball then he", "start": 101.759, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "turns it up to the top and it's pretty well planed out I know something he's been working on is is getting the club a little less laid off and almost a little", "start": 114.439, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "across the line Y well this is probably what seven six iron maybe yeah and then you can see in transition his hands", "start": 123.399, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "actually work back higher so if you look at left arm parallel he's right there now we look at left arm parallel again he's on the other side of the line so", "start": 133.239, "duration": 17.282}
{"chunk": "his arms didn't fall back they actually went out and he's got he's got a similar pattern to Kea and Hing that sort of", "start": 142.44, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "slight bent left arm there out of transition slight bow yeah that left the whole left arm unit is pretty soft but he's using you can see he's curling", "start": 150.8, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "those Knuckles down in transition in the left hand and adding extension yeah in the trail wrist so I know hearing him", "start": 159.68, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "talk he actually his feel is in the left hand so he feels like he's shutting the face the whole way down with his left wrist and he has more of a what would", "start": 168.68, "duration": 17.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "you say neutral-ish yeah his grip's pretty neutral we'll look at it in a little bit from face on I kind of liked if you go", "start": 177.959, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "back to the start Milo I kind of like looking at these he's got those two desente logos um one of one on his shorts like", "start": 184.92, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "his right glute and then one on his right shoulder there so you can see how that that that one on his shorts as you", "start": 193.72, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "go back if you go to kind of in his back swing it really pushes into that line so like yeah you know I'm guessing that's a yardage book in his back pocket that's", "start": 202.12, "duration": 19.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "pushing back so he's got plenty of space there early in the back swing and he he loses a little bit of", "start": 211.959, "duration": 16.361}
{"chunk": "height early because of that because his pelvis is gaining a little depth and then you'll see here in", "start": 220.36, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "transition he really kind of squeezes down into the ground loses a little more", "start": 228.599, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "height PR money pretty money not a lot of roll in the face pretty darn stable through the strike our camera angles a little behind", "start": 235.879, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "his feet here so we're not quite seeing the plane exactly as it is because I would guess that at shaft parallel it's almost dead in his hands right there", "start": 245.239, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "yeah that makes it again that's why camera angles are so important someone could look at this and be like Oh my club's outside the hands that's pretty", "start": 254.439, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "money I just look for the overall motion he swings it up gets it really pled out it shallows out so it's more shallow now", "start": 261.84, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "than it was and works around the corner beautifully and that's just a little soft cut judging by all the finish and", "start": 270.68, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "everything I'm seeing there any uh thoughts on this angle Ed or Zach yeah I was going to talk about", "start": 279.56, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "his shoulders not being too like retracted so just allows a little bit more freedom through the upper back yeah so I don't know if that's a change that", "start": 287.08, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "he's made but I think over the last like handful of years a lot the the coaches were wanting more retracted stronger shoulder", "start": 295.8, "duration": 16.519}
{"chunk": "blades and I don't know that it's helpful with rotation a lot of times so I like it yeah we see that very rigid", "start": 304.199, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "straight backs chin up you know the brim of the look at the brim of Xander's hat it's down like almost parallel with the", "start": 312.32, "duration": 16.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "shaft it's not out on the horizon so if you draw a line straight through his head it's not quite parallel to a shaft", "start": 320.4, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "but it's not far from it cool look at a different view so he went from being a little more outside of his hands to more", "start": 328.08, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "in line with his hands now some players can turn to the top and make that outside the hands look correct but a lot of times it will get dumped laid off", "start": 337.759, "duration": 18.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah which is what happens with him he dumps it into a laid off he used to dump it into a laid off position now he actually gets it slightly crossed yeah", "start": 346.16, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "which I prefer to be slightly crossed over laid off all day long well a little bit of that too is just how he's winding up it's not just", "start": 355.4, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "how he's pathing the arms or the hands his windup is just a little different too and so now you can see the", "start": 364.44, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "top of the back swing how before the the club was behind his hands and now it's a little across the line so that's a pretty significant change that reminds", "start": 373.0, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "me of some other person we've been working with this is basically the exact same change I've been working with Dana I also notic his pelvis has wound a lot", "start": 382.24, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "more now yeah so if you look at his his hips have turned more than they used to they used to be pretty it was like he was resisting quite a lot overall like", "start": 391.08, "duration": 16.519}
{"chunk": "the bends in his spine aren't really that not that different that different it's really more the the arm structure I would say Wrist", "start": 399.56, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "structure gril arm's less supinated it's a little more pronated in the cross I like it so let's look at his actual swing now from down the line if we have", "start": 407.44, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "one or face face on I should say the thing think about too is like when you have that structure that he had before there's kind of a limit to how far you", "start": 415.919, "duration": 17.282}
{"chunk": "can wind up isn't there don't you feel like it kind of like but if I feel like it's structured and like it is working almost across the line at the very top", "start": 425.24, "duration": 16.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "like I could keep going what feels like forever yeah well this is cool this we didn't catch the beginning of this golf swing um I think if you go farther down", "start": 433.919, "duration": 17.319}
{"chunk": "like halfway down so you can see a little the little trigger you see his arms kind of stiffen his chest rise a", "start": 442.319, "duration": 15.002}
{"chunk": "little a little bit in that early phase before the club moves yeah Jim Thomas just said I noticed his hip hip logo", "start": 449.36, "duration": 15.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "goes back horizontally I'm guessing that maybe that was from down the line hip logo that was probably the desent yeah now it creates a really nice big wind up", "start": 457.199, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "and if you watch the sequence here so you can see how many frames do we", "start": 466.68, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "go with his hand still going up but his pelvis going down you should draw those lines like I did that one time where like have a table", "start": 475.44, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "under his hands and one on his pelvis so you did could even do one on his left knee like a line like this", "start": 485.639, "duration": 16.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "yeah and then one like this could put one on his left knee and left shoulder too I wonder if I've haven't done that one before but it' be interesting to", "start": 493.28, "duration": 19.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "see Elis is going down hands are going up it's like those hands 9 10 11 12 yeah", "start": 502.879, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "cool 13 that's a lot of frames before those hands start to move most people's hands are like in the right pocket already by now that's a he's got a", "start": 513.12, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "beautiful sequence like really nice flow and so he's his left arm is bending during this phase because it's really stretching that whole system out because", "start": 522.159, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "it was that left arm was a lot straighter right here but now as his pelvis starts to go and his ribs start to go the slack in those arms just lets", "start": 531.2, "duration": 19.641}
{"chunk": "them kind of soften a little bit and you can see there is there no pull down in that golf swing that thing is loaded like a slingshot at P5 now it", "start": 540.0, "duration": 18.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "just unwinds and you can see he's still got the his hands to the right of his Center Line his midline yeah and the club still", "start": 552.399, "duration": 19.481}
{"chunk": "to the right at impact that's pretty money and then everything just releases freely through so we were out in San", "start": 561.64, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "Diego little story here we were out in San Diego for golf School uh last fall I believe and Xander", "start": 570.48, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "that's where he kind of was based out of he might have moved now but he was practicing at the Grand and um he was", "start": 578.24, "duration": 15.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "doing some he get some wed shots he was doing split grip like his rehearsals and a lot of like F2 style wed shots I think", "start": 586.2, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "I posted one with a ball recently with a pro Center maybe he still does F2 all the time yeah and his his swing", "start": 594.519, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "is the that transition and that move through impact is very very similar to a lot of the stuff we talk about in the that drill that he", "start": 601.76, "duration": 20.84}
{"chunk": "was working on um Jim asks why does Milo prefer slightly across rather than laid off easier to create good", "start": 612.36, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "path when you're laid off the club wants to Tumble path wants to go left so then you wind up having to tilt away to m mat", "start": 621.079, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "it up we should show we'll show the forces after yeah we can show some some of what happens once we're demonstrating here in a minute hey Milo uh this is", "start": 629.519, "duration": 20.68}
{"chunk": "kind of a cool angle can you talk a little bit about like left shoulder blade Mobility because I'm seeing his shoulder blade really like protract a", "start": 639.6, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "long way and I think a lot of our students probably could use some Mobility stuff for their shoulder blades to achieve this stretch here at the top", "start": 648.639, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "like he's getting yeah right here is he reaching the top you can see that left shoulder has moved a the blade is moved a long ways around his rib", "start": 657.519, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "cage that's a big part of loading that stretch if you don't have enough Mobility there then you're not going to be able to make that kind of turn and", "start": 666.6, "duration": 17.638}
{"chunk": "get that stretch there's one other view I got I think got Trail View we got rear view here so he definitely has the you", "start": 675.959, "duration": 15.720999999999998}
{"chunk": "can really see that trigger right there he's got all the pressure in his left foot his right foot's unweighting right now now he's going into his right foot", "start": 683.8, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "and then the club starts to move big wind if we put a line down his tailbone", "start": 690.959, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "there it moves to the forward side of that line and then he shifts a little bit more but immediately watch as he lands that tailbone starts to Circle", "start": 699.16, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "back to where it started now it's basically back on the original wall Bo and there's that's a good angle to see that", "start": 709.04, "duration": 16.999}
{"chunk": "the hands are staying to the right right of his middle yeah you can really see as he's turning into the ball his hands are to the right to the right to the right", "start": 718.0, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "so we get we get asked a lot what does it mean to the right or what does it mean to have the club trailing or what is it you know hopefully that gives you", "start": 726.44, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "the perspective we're talking about is that the hands are yes the hands are to the right of the midline but that club is well to the right of him it's", "start": 735.44, "duration": 20.52}
{"chunk": "trailing him he's circling the corner he's not he's not having that club and His Hands cross him so much so at this point in time his chest is pointing out", "start": 745.04, "duration": 17.801}
{"chunk": "there in front of that micro see this microphone right here on the ground his chest is pointing out left of that and he still hasn't hit", "start": 754.24, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "the ball yet", "start": 763.56, "duration": 2.719}
