{"chunk": "let's just talk a little about your journey with golf so you kind of became a golf nut yeah for sure yeah and you", "start": 21.92, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "you've taken a golf swing that was let's just say it wasn't that great right right we won't show anybody of the before but now your move's pretty good and you're fast right rock it right", "start": 29.359, "duration": 17.362000000000002}
{"chunk": "right and you've had some wooden influences [Music] right for sure lucas wald yeah me yeah", "start": 38.8, "duration": 18.898}
{"chunk": "um but then you've also learned some other stuff some some movement stuff that i think might be very beneficial for", "start": 50.0, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "my audience right right awesome so years ago i remember i read in tpi that", "start": 57.36, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "the three main causes of back pain were the reverse pivot backswing so leaning too far to the right yep that", "start": 65.36, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "the early extension and the reversi finish and all of those are some form of", "start": 75.2, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "extension extension extension extension this is real hyperlordotic excessive spine extension state where the pelvis is getting thrust", "start": 82.479, "duration": 20.159}
{"chunk": "up underneath the ribcage because in the golf swing we want to be able to keep that pelvis behind the ribs the ribs in", "start": 92.799, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "front for as long as you know as long as we can you know eventually like yes there's some extension things get kicked up but we know", "start": 100.799, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "how many students do you ever say you held flexion too long right it's always too early almost always into", "start": 110.24, "duration": 16.642}
{"chunk": "this way like once we get maybe down here the shaft parallel yes you start seeing a lot more extension but it's it's late it's late yeah we want to stay", "start": 120.24, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "chest down butt back as long as we can it's basically the spiral i promise will kick you up", "start": 129.92, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "if you're sequencing correctly and this club is kind of following you about this time now you're kind of done with down you can start to curve up the up the", "start": 138.16, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "other side curve up the hub up back and away yeah and you have to so you can get the energy out into the club head exactly but for most people they probably need to be thinking more about", "start": 146.4, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "this portion of the swing than they do about yes this portion the extension portion of this thing maybe you might run into some people who need a little of that right", "start": 155.84, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "but it's way more rare it's all the motion is done with the pelvis behind the ribs and so you're learning yes i", "start": 164.48, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "can generate speed that way yes i can because i think a lot of people milo they they just assume this is the only way to create speed like they don't", "start": 171.76, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "realize like there's other ways to create speed yeah it's a chicken and egg thing i a lot of people they're", "start": 180.959, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "they're putting a lot of speed into their arms really early oh for sure the army so then whether they want to or not they have to extend right so it's like are they", "start": 188.879, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "extending because their arms are coming down or are they are their arms coming down because they're extending i don't know who knows one of them one of them but if they", "start": 197.84, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "learn how to get their pelvis deep and keep it back there they better not throw their arms at it because if they do", "start": 205.68, "duration": 15.038}
{"chunk": "the ground is going to get in the way right so right they learn a different pattern they learn a different pattern cool so let's let's review this again so", "start": 213.599, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "that the three main causes for back pain according to tpi according to tpi and i tend to agree yeah i'm sure i did a", "start": 221.519, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "video on how to swing with a rotational swing safely years ago and it basically goes right in line with", "start": 230.64, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "what we're talking about here only thing i added was i'm not a huge fan of restriction because if you restrict you tend to", "start": 238.56, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "fire up and in yes so i like to see a little bit more freedom in the pelvis let it move so", "start": 246.799, "duration": 16.002}
{"chunk": "they are again reverse pivot in the back swing so my pelvis getting getting is getting tucked underneath so all the all the pressure", "start": 254.48, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "now is in your l-spine yep i can feel it just yeah you can just feel it yep and then the second one is early extension pelvis which that's", "start": 266.16, "duration": 19.601000000000003}
{"chunk": "going to cause me to have to tilt and it puts pressure right there again because if i early extend and i don't tilt then i'm going to be super", "start": 276.08, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "duper steep and across right yeah and then the last one was the reverse sea fish which everyone knows is bad but which is the same thing", "start": 284.24, "duration": 18.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "that pelvis moving the pelvis getting too thrust up and dictating yep and you can feel it it just hurts your back just demonstrating stretches even just standing there static it's like no", "start": 294.0, "duration": 20.078}
{"chunk": "thanks yes the spine the spine extending is really of less importance than the pelvis being behind the ribs so my", "start": 303.039, "duration": 18.082}
{"chunk": "pelvis can be behind the ribs and i can be in a flexion state or an extension state if you even if you", "start": 312.88, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "keep this pelvis behind but you're super arched extended then you're going to want to fire it before because it's all connected like 99 of", "start": 320.88, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "the world if they get here they cannot maintain it no not a chance they're going to go and that's because because you go into", "start": 328.72, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "spine extension all the patterns are linked you go into spine extension the next thing that wants to go is hips they're all linked", "start": 337.199, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "but even even in the downswing most guys you're seeing more you're seeing more of this right you don't see this in the impact no no", "start": 345.28, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "you want to have thoracic flexion there's some flexion in the system talk a little bit about that roundedness and that blizzard move a little bit that we", "start": 353.52, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "maybe you could mention that a little bit the bends and let's get into the we can we can get into how the how we should move so now", "start": 361.68, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "that we understand that it's a some of the extension patterns are what's hurting us how should we be moving let's kind of walk through what we should be doing", "start": 370.16, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "in a golf swing i think the main thing i mean what you're teaching milo is like money like it's money it's it's right on", "start": 379.44, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "the it's right on the button i'd say um we want we want a lot of pelvic pelvic depth right that we get that you get", "start": 388.88, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "down here you start arcing it up back and away lots of thoracic rotation lots of thoracic rotation uh", "start": 397.68, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "you need to have a club face right that's in a position that allows all this good anatomical stuff to happen um", "start": 405.6, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "can't the face wide open so you got to have wrist conditions that all make sense um how does the spine bend when what is", "start": 414.08, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "where is safe bend occurring so i think the the the main bends that we see in the in the golf swing is there's there's a left bend in the ribs", "start": 421.44, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "right there's a left bend in the ribs so if we bend in the ribs that also bends in our spine and our thoracic spine right yeah when i say ribs that's just for", "start": 430.96, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "the normal person that can feel ribs no one feels their spine bending but that you feel the ribs kind of crunch but yeah so there's a left bending of the thoracic spine", "start": 439.36, "duration": 17.438}
{"chunk": "i think a lot of people get in trouble when they try to get the side bend they try to get the too much from down here and too much from the lumbar spine so as soon as you", "start": 448.319, "duration": 17.921999999999997}
{"chunk": "start bending from the lumbar spine you can see how my head really gets outside the system gets outside my columns but", "start": 456.8, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "if you're keeping the bends primarily in the thoracic space in the thoracic spine or feel it in the ribs you can keep keep a lot more", "start": 465.44, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "stacked so that's primarily where where the bends are coming from instead of instead of excessive tilting so this sounds", "start": 474.8, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "familiar i've heard that yes exactly on my channel left bends right vents so that's sort of how and it's kind of a little", "start": 482.96, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah it makes some little figure eight kind of makes a little figure eight it makes a little figure eight but but this is where you want most of the bending to come from if it gets too much in the", "start": 491.44, "duration": 18.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "lumbar spine we start tilting when it also when it starts to get into the lumbar spine it's going to cause those extension patterns to show back up that's right so that makes you hurt and", "start": 499.919, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "that's why i wish a lot of a lot of the rotation the pelvis rotation that we see in a golf swing milo i think if people conceptualize", "start": 508.72, "duration": 19.680000000000003}
{"chunk": "that it's actually occurring in the hip complex i think they would be way better off that's the hip joints that rotate not really the you don't want the lumbar", "start": 518.56, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "spine and the pelvis spinning we want the because the hips are like the transmission the hip joints that's how we get forces", "start": 527.2, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "to work in the ground that's right and that's in the so if the pelvic like in a down the line view if you if i have some", "start": 535.2, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "degree of of hip flexion right some degree of this bend right here when i rotate you'll see that that kind of straight and that goes out and then with", "start": 542.72, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "a little thoracic bending of the right i can get into a really pretty cool impact position and you can see down the line you can see", "start": 551.92, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "both butt cheeks but i haven't brought it into the lumbar spine you haven't the bulk of the rotation that's right the bulk of the pelvis rotation", "start": 559.76, "duration": 19.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "that you're seeing is from hip socket hip socket so i think that's huge as opposed to everyone thinks they have to", "start": 569.839, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "take this and get the pelvis that way you see that hip extension they try to get here and now all the pressure is way in the back as opposed to something like", "start": 578.72, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "this with the sacrum the sacral move i talk about all the time yeah um with the sacrum working away as soon as that sacrum pushes up or hips extend", "start": 587.12, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "the sacrum actually goes towards the target so that's some cool stuff so let's wrap this one up put a bow on it", "start": 597.04, "duration": 16.078}
