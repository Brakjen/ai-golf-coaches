{"chunk": "so hey everybody there were some questions that didn't get answered in our webinar from yesterday so henry and i are going to go through and answer as many as we can", "start": 0.24, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "right now there we go all right uh we had a question about feeling the weight of the club throughout the swing", "start": 9.04, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "so you know that's that's definitely a difficult one if especially if we're used to wanting to throw or cast or or", "start": 21.6, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "hit from the top right yeah so you're not going to really feel the weight of the club unless it's at the bottom there's some good ways to kind of trick yourself into", "start": 30.56, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "feeling it make the club really light for a second and just swing a grip so you can feel okay i can start to feel", "start": 39.36, "duration": 16.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "the weight of the grip now when i flip the club over ooh that club head feels nice and heavy i can feel it now but the big key is just tension levels", "start": 47.76, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "if our if our arms are not clinched tight you're probably going to be able to feel the weight of the club the minute i tighten up", "start": 58.16, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "it all feels like one big unit i have no control it just feels like too much all one not enough freedom", "start": 65.92, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "so that's where i would i would have them go back to uh the early foundation pieces where you're talking about your grip and how", "start": 74.24, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "your arms are sort of positioned making sure those are right before you get all boggled down what's going on maybe at the top of your swing and not feeling", "start": 81.36, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "the club sure one thing just real quick i've noticed about the step drill is that i think it can be easy to kind of make it a very", "start": 89.92, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "lateral you know linear motion right yeah i when i do any step drills though i really like to feel i almost feel like", "start": 99.759, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "sometimes i'll start close to the ball have my back foot kind of go back that way i'm creating this turn and then my left foot go back creating this turn", "start": 107.439, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "that's a really i love that kind of a step drill as well it's a good way it's like a good little spin on a step drill how to do it it's awesome", "start": 115.84, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "my thing with anytime you're going to do a step drill you want to move both the upper and this and the lower centers together and then we want to convert it once our foot hits", "start": 124.479, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "the ground we convert it into rotational energy we don't want to just keep right wandering off to the side so", "start": 133.36, "duration": 16.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "perfect okay all right so um now in our questionnaire or in our chat feed on zoom", "start": 140.959, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "uh aaron asked uh do you feel like you hit the ball with your right side so i think this has come up a few times you hit with your left side or", "start": 149.28, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "your right side i don't hit there you go i don't know okay so let's ask let's ask this way then do you feel", "start": 158.879, "duration": 16.760999999999996}
{"chunk": "like you're focus is like okay like i feel my right oblique crunching i got this right side bend and i turn the corner with", "start": 167.92, "duration": 17.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "this wrist extension or do you feel like your left side pulls you out of the way i feel like it's more left sided okay i feel like when my left", "start": 176.239, "duration": 17.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "side goes out of the way it creates all these dynamics in my right side for me so this is the leader this is the driver this is the passenger", "start": 185.12, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "that's kind of the way i feel i feel like if you get right-sided you'll tend to push yourself into your own way", "start": 193.599, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "and it's then you wind up with having to side bend too much and so i'm more of my left leg my left oblique this", "start": 200.879, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "is a puller and it creates this this crunch in my body and it might even start a little sooner and it's basically from at the top you're falling into that", "start": 209.12, "duration": 17.918}
{"chunk": "lead side and that pulls you around the corner right and it's the pressure that hits that one so when i fall and i stop myself from falling that", "start": 218.159, "duration": 16.402}
{"chunk": "pressure that hits it creates a lot of things so all right so eli asked does grip affect", "start": 226.48, "duration": 15.518}
{"chunk": "how shallow you get yes actually if you look at players who have a weaker grip they need more shoulder extension so", "start": 234.159, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "they got to lower their arms down more to square the face up so generally guys with weaker grips have shallower golf swings we could", "start": 243.599, "duration": 17.202}
{"chunk": "i wish we could post mahant's swing yeah oh ben hogan would be a good one to maybe bring to mind weaker more shallow or if you go in and look at like the", "start": 251.68, "duration": 16.638}
{"chunk": "long drive guys who have really strong grips most of their swings don't come down as shallow yeah they swing more right through their shoulder plane up higher", "start": 260.479, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "and it's because they don't need as much shoulder extension to square the face up so cool", "start": 268.72, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "matt asks how do we have more passive arms in transition i always tend to get stuck and stall flip", "start": 277.04, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "or come over the top so i would say i guess number one is where are your arms at the top what's the structure", "start": 285.36, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "look like so in order to be able to have your arms not aren't necessarily passive they're just moving along with your body in the right arc so", "start": 293.36, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "if first thing i look at is your body pivoting well and is your arm structure good if it is you're probably okay if your body is pivoting poorly", "start": 302.56, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "then you're having to make up for a lot of things with your arms right right we see this move a lot so like from here", "start": 311.36, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "basically you know what you have to do something with the hands and arms you can't get the ball right well the other thing i see is a pretty decent turn and then you go", "start": 320.0, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "this way and now i'm never going to hit it right so now i've got to do this to hit it with my hands right and so you you know you you", "start": 329.6, "duration": 19.76}
{"chunk": "see things along those lines so the first thing is let's address the structure issues if the structure issues are good and the pivot's good", "start": 338.8, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "then you should never get stuck i've never seen anybody get stuck whose body was turning correctly usually stuck means that you you're tilting somewhere", "start": 347.36, "duration": 16.959999999999997}
{"chunk": "along the line like that right and there was one more that somebody asked another one yeah somebody asked a question about backswing and how to make how what's our", "start": 355.44, "duration": 19.837999999999997}
{"chunk": "preferred method of taking the club back um well we talked about takeaway though last night because we were talking about", "start": 364.639, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "you know feeling like there's a little push down club gets up in front of you how do we make that dynamic", "start": 373.44, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "with all your time with pressure shifts like this so i like to have the little for me it's the backswing is is not that complicated i feel like i'm", "start": 380.8, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "taking the club and i'm just throwing it up over my shoulder but using my my body to do it yeah", "start": 389.199, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "and so all you feel is you feel like there's a little pressure move to the left and then your your torso starts to wind up and that puts the club into the right", "start": 396.88, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "arc so if you struggle with the club going getting sucked in or doing anything like that it's because you're you're using your hands", "start": 406.56, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "to move the golf club rather than using your your body's energy to move the golf club so", "start": 414.0, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "i hope you enjoyed this video please leave a comment below with any questions thoughts or future video ideas", "start": 421.68, "duration": 15.2}
