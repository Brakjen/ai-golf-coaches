{"chunk": "stuff i would have said and so you know her dad was the same things like yes you just can't get out of that end out path as hard as to try she can not swing left so i grabbed an impact", "start": 421.12, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "bag kind of put the zipper right down the middle and i just said can you take this bag and make a spin like that and hit it so she hit it and did it immediately i did it like two or three", "start": 430.319, "duration": 16.480999999999998}

{"chunk": "like minus four with four open face so her dad looked at me like what what how how is that possible i just well i just gave it to her in a way her", "start": 446.08, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "mind could process that that's all it's the same exact thing everything was right everything she was trying to do was exactly that i just gave it to her", "start": 454.8, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "in a picture that she could actually comprehend you know like throw a ball low you know i move my hand down here you react to that and throw it low", "start": 463.039, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "type thing versus you know the actual steps to get there now if i take like an istj and do that same thing they're going to look at me like i'm crazy they're like well give me", "start": 470.96, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "the directions to do that so you know when i when it's like understanding those things but again like so that particular girl like i", "start": 479.12, "duration": 15.839999999999998}
{"chunk": "could relate to that because that's everything that's the way i'm wired i i mean i played a bunch of different sports when i pitched i threw out three different arm angles like i can make", "start": 487.36, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "balls spin i can do things with ping pong paddles like all that stuff resonated so again even taking like an intj years ago i would have said the same thing and", "start": 495.199, "duration": 16.321}

{"chunk": "know where does the club need to be where does my hands need to be type thing and that's the stuff that always like really frustrated me so i kind of had to relearn to to go like who", "start": 511.28, "duration": 17.6}

{"chunk": "i don't really i'm kind of intuitive as far as how to make the ball curve and so i don't need to see those numbers i just like to make a curve", "start": 555.68, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "yeah i mean that's always how i kind of worked on my swing for the most part if i was you know pushing and hooking it type thing i would just go out try to start it laughing faded i knew my swing was in", "start": 564.88, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "a good spot but again i mean that's essentially how i i was kind of now going down in the beginning stage my coaches coaching is", "start": 574.08, "duration": 15.999}

{"chunk": "think like that they're not wired like that you know they like a little more of the positional stuff p1 the p2", "start": 590.16, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "type type movements yeah and they like to know exactly where the club needs to be at every every interval of the golf swing and so you've got that that's where they yeah", "start": 597.279, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "that's where they get comfort is they know things are in place so i know my positions are right they get a lot of calm for that where i'm like if i you know i just if i know the ball is", "start": 606.0, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "starting left i'm good let's go play so it's just we're all calling by different things we're all stressed by different things yeah cool", "start": 614.56, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "so knowing that how can we go how can we implement these ideas to be better coaches and to be better students yeah so we'll start", "start": 623.279, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "with the student side and um you know like first things first with like an extroverted player i can't stress enough is talk everything out the", "start": 632.399, "duration": 16.321}

{"chunk": "have a busy schedule but i like to get out and help players and caddy with them talk shots out and things like that so i carried for one of my corn fairy guys he was in a", "start": 649.6, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "monday qualifier out here in knoxville and i just told him he's i mean he's the same as me which is interesting i mean he's been with me since he's been in eighth grade", "start": 658.079, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "and i mean you know when we started kind of learning these things from john i took him through some an early assessment i mean he's an enfp which makes total sense that he stood the test", "start": 667.6, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "time kept growing because he just did what i did that worked for me so his he fit my coaching model back then which is you know why we've been", "start": 676.24, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "together so long and have such a good relationship but anyways so i just told him i said look our only goal out there is we're going to talk every single shot at this morning tell me where it's going to", "start": 685.12, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "start where it's going to go and again he i had him on track man the day before and he was hitting it awful he started where's my attack angle was my path need to be and just hitting us", "start": 693.2, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "so bad and i finally just went out just threw a couple balls on the range said just go hit it left and fade it and then he was like back um", "start": 702.0, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "so he's got to be careful because he's got a lot of friends close friends that he's always have a track man behind him so he falls into that trap of wanting to get into that but", "start": 710.639, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "sorry i'm getting off track so anyway so we go out and i'm chatting for him and i just said it's our only goal we're gonna talk every single shot i want you physically tell me where you're gonna start it and where it's gonna go did it", "start": 718.8, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "all day long um he had nine birdies in one boat and the only bogey was i mean he missed a short side of pin like very close got a", "start": 727.76, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "bad hop into a bare bunker and just couldn't get up and down but i mean it was one of the most flawless things ever he just kept telling me i'm gonna start it here it's gonna fade it and it's just", "start": 736.48, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "all day long perfect perfect perfect um similar to actually that same girl i was just alluding to the other day she was 13 she's 13 was 13 years old at the", "start": 744.32, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "time she's 14 out but played in the u.s junior girls qualifier against the same thing enfp um and did the same thing just let's talk", "start": 753.76, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "every single shout out we're just going to talk i'm going to keep you smiling we're not going to be negative about any anything today we're going to find positive every single shot", "start": 763.12, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "um i mean her dad it was was like if she breaks 77 it's a great day and she shot 72 with a triple three birdies and then", "start": 770.839, "duration": 16.922}
{"chunk": "actually qualifying the playoff two under through the last four doing that same thing awesome i mean so it and it's not like a brag or", "start": 780.16, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "anything it's just like that's how powerful even that side of that thing is it's like experts really talking things out i have a story about an introverted player", "start": 789.279, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "that had the exact opposite effect when his coach was trying to make him talk everything out he played terrible so it's like introverts just kind of need to know how they need to formulate the", "start": 797.36, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "things extroverts need to know how they need to do things um intuitive and sensor you know that player side target side is", "start": 806.959, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "really really important to be aware of so like an intuitive player is finding ways to basically i would say the simplest thing", "start": 815.04, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "i could just give as a broad universe for an intuitive is work on your swing by hitting a shot that helps so for example if um you know if you're", "start": 824.0, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "just hitting the ball too high like you're scooping adding loft at the bottom just go work on him punch shots you know learn to keep the ball low like i mean that's it sounds so simple but", "start": 832.8, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "that's essentially how they figured out i mean and if they can't like i'll put something in their way i'll just put like a pool noodle on some sticks or something give them a bar", "start": 841.92, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "figure out how to hit it under that and they kind of pick that up a lot quicker than you know bow the wrist type thing and again all that stuff is actually it's right and it's really", "start": 849.76, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "great information it's just how do they process that information where a sensor is going to need probably a little more of that like here here's how you get that wrist in that position", "start": 858.56, "duration": 17.358999999999998}

{"chunk": "players but so it's just that difference of like how are you working on the swing and then how do you think about it in a way or folks in a way when you play that's very", "start": 875.279, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "simple right so like working on pressure in the ground might be a great thing but that might be a hard thought to produce on the golf course", "start": 883.839, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "yeah versus versus just keep the club face low or breathe out and hit it you know having some sort of focus like that where it's", "start": 892.32, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "like you can you feel really comfortable if i do this this is the result and you know when i've asked players at every single level that question like", "start": 899.76, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "how do you focus over the ball to know what the results could be not many people have that answer and when they do get that answer that's when a lot of the consistency comes", "start": 908.639, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "because now they can they can work at it on the golf on the range they can you know implement it on the course then they can actually measure that like how", "start": 917.36, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "often did i actually stick to my thought over the ball so like an intuitive well like a lot like that jordan that guy was talking about the qualifier we i built", "start": 926.56, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "like a field goal about a pvc and we just hit it through the field goal so when we go out there like his focus is", "start": 934.48, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "just hey can you can you kick the field goal with a little fade or something and he's you know we just we measure that now how often do you stage your field goal or how often did you slip and", "start": 942.8, "duration": 19.358}
{"chunk": "get into like questioning your swing so when we have those things it becomes really really powerful because now we we start to link", "start": 952.079, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "those thoughts are starting to shift that's really interesting because i can see where certain students don't don't like", "start": 959.839, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "the same processes that i use like i don't even really they i've had multiple people ask me what are you looking at when you hit the ball and i don't know i don't even look at the", "start": 968.56, "duration": 18.8}
