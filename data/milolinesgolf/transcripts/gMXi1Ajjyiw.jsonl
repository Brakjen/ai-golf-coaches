{"chunk": "so welcome out to superstition mountain today we're going to talk you through how you can hit your irons like a tour pro using just this one simple drill now", "start": 5.279, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "henry's hung out with me enough to know some of my ideas on on how to swing a golf club and i think we agree on most everything now if you want to be able to strike", "start": 15.2, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "your irons like a tour pro some of the things that you need to have is you need to have the handle ahead of the head at impact right we call that shaft lean", "start": 23.76, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "and we also need our body to be kind of opening up so we're out of our own way right now most of you are going about doing that the wrong way", "start": 32.16, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "so henry let's let's walk everybody through how how we go about creating those dynamics yeah so i mean look we're all trying to get that handle", "start": 40.96, "duration": 18.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "forward we see dustin johnson he's like out here right so oh i should just drive the hands forward right it's not that's that's what everybody", "start": 50.0, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "thinks but um what usually happens when when somebody tries to do that well i mean if you're kind of coming down the line or you're pulling your hands", "start": 58.96, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "forward and coming in really narrow you got to get that club out of the ball somehow right yeah so we stall out throw the club and you get a whole", "start": 67.36, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "slew of funny things happening and if you don't you get shanks and slices and all kinds of issues okay so let's walk through how do", "start": 75.119, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "we actually create that dynamic what are what are two players doing that creates that dynamic right so i mean if you just go to impact right", "start": 83.119, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "as you were showing before the handle's a little forward a lot of them have some that left hip kind of backing out of the way or the lead hip", "start": 91.2, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "backing out of the way right their head's kind of on the ball or just behind it and there you go now how do you get there right", "start": 98.88, "duration": 18.078}
{"chunk": "this right trail wrist plays a pretty important role right right if i throw this trail wrist i'm not going to have any shaft lane", "start": 107.759, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "look the club's already past my hands exactly right so instead i maintain this angle as i begin to rotate out of the", "start": 116.399, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "way perfect now it's key that the angle we're actually trying to maintain is the extension of the trail right most", "start": 125.92, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "of you guys are trying to maintain the hinge up of the wrist which is death right so we want to feel like that wrist", "start": 133.68, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "is is back here like this with weight of the clubs holding it back just like a ball does when we throw it right just like skipping a rock or throwing the ball perfect so let's walk through the drill", "start": 142.319, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "that can help everybody learn how to feel that right and some people have probably seen this drill where you preset impact right so what i would do instead", "start": 152.0, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "of just driving the hands forward for this impact drill i'm going to back my left hip out of the way", "start": 160.56, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "my chest starts to open a little bit now i re-grip and i hit a little chip shot out there perfect now", "start": 168.319, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "the trail wrist as i brought it back extended uh-huh and i maintained it and rotated through", "start": 176.879, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "perfect so that's the key so we we've got to get that trail wrist extended now if the trail wrist is extended is it possible to hit the ball without", "start": 184.72, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "rotating through it's going to be really difficult i don't think you can so i think that's kind of the key if we get that trail", "start": 194.0, "duration": 15.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "wrist extended then we have to start to use our lead side to turn ourselves out of the way and we're going to get the rotation that", "start": 200.8, "duration": 15.117999999999999}
{"chunk": "we want right because everyone's trying to keep this radial this more vertical hinge coming down but look where that puts me you can't", "start": 208.959, "duration": 17.282}
{"chunk": "even hit the ball no you have to dump it definitely not rotating because the club's here so you stall and you throw if you have extension", "start": 217.76, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "clubs more back here and you can rotate and oh you're not going to take a big divot either that can be shallow and hit that nice compressed ball flight", "start": 226.48, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "so let's do that again let's do a nice little small one so we let me just show them one more time on this angle okay so here's my impact again i'm not just pushing the hands", "start": 234.879, "duration": 17.762}
{"chunk": "forward i rotate chest starts to open now i get the handle where we want it okay so do that again", "start": 243.68, "duration": 19.759}
{"chunk": "just a little chippy one perfect so once you can do that what do we do next so from there once", "start": 252.879, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "you feel comfortable with that shorter distance that i'm hitting it you know i have a pitching wedge here i'm only hitting at what 70 80 yards yep so once i get", "start": 262.479, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "comfortable with that now i just take a longer swing i build it up a little bit so now we're going to turn it back a", "start": 272.0, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "little farther and turn it through a little bit more right right but i'm still going to preset here and then go back perfect", "start": 279.36, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "beautiful and that's striking an iron like a tour pro well there you go so build it up you've probably seen some torque players do this drill", "start": 292.08, "duration": 16.078}
{"chunk": "but the key is the extension the right wrist and knowing to rotate once you have that yep", "start": 299.759, "duration": 16.322}
{"chunk": "those are the keys there you go", "start": 306.88, "duration": 4.96}
