{"chunk": "so that's the key the key is the timing of the push so now let's talk about why we we might actually get too slidy and tilty", "start": 105.04, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "what's going to what we're going to see happen is we're not going to see this push happen soon enough so if i turn back here", "start": 113.119, "duration": 16.081000000000003}

{"chunk": "swing the club out in front of you and then while the club is still working up we're going to create a little step to the right", "start": 180.879, "duration": 16.642}
