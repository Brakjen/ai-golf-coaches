{"chunk": "hey guys how to hit those tasty rotational draws without rolling your forearms", "start": 0.08, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "[Music] okay milo i should probably preface this by saying there is some forearm roll in the golf swing we know this right", "start": 10.05, "duration": 16.431}
{"chunk": "it's pretty much impossible to have no forearm roll yeah it's close now for us to hit draws there's a couple match-ups that we need right", "start": 18.64, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "but one of the match-ups you see a lot is that forearm roll uh-huh okay", "start": 28.08, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "but is this the most consistent way to create that hooking ball flight that we are after right the ball that starts a", "start": 34.32, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "little out to the right i like to see a little push draw not a pull draw that's a good way to hit a hook yeah not a very good way to hit a soft draw i", "start": 42.719, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "mean you'll see it like tiger woods is a perfect example he's stuck behind a tree and he's got to hook it out way to the right you're going to see some more", "start": 51.28, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "forearm rolling manipulating situation and then vice versa if you have to cut it around a tree he'll actually hold on and release crazily this way right so", "start": 58.8, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "but that's drastic curves we're not right here we're talking about a gentle little draw we don't one that we can control", "start": 67.68, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "right and hopefully a little push draw that starts right at your target and ends up on the target okay what are a couple things that you might change in order to", "start": 75.28, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "accomplish that little push straw what i do first thing is just change my ball position slightly okay so i'm going to move the ball about half a ball farther toward the", "start": 84.56, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "back of my stance okay so what is moving it back accomplished it helps me hit it a little bit more in the downward part of my arc which also happens to be where", "start": 94.32, "duration": 19.839999999999996}
{"chunk": "my arc is going more from in to out interesting okay so yeah i mean if you have the ball you know a little bit let's say for me i", "start": 104.24, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "i typically have it up sort of near my left ear i actually like to have a little more forward because i tend to play fades if i can when i'm playing well i like to play fade", "start": 112.56, "duration": 16.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "but if i were to move it a little farther back that path now becomes a little more out to the right because it's not it's not going up around me back to the left as", "start": 121.119, "duration": 19.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "soon right so that ball would hopefully start a little more right unless i compensated and added a little bit of that roll that we", "start": 130.56, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "were talking about for sure farther back anything else that you would change my swing i i let be a little different", "start": 139.36, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "so as i'm changing directions i'll do this for the camera i like to feel like i let the club get a little bit farther back", "start": 148.08, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "okay a little bit more behind me than my normal swing which allows the club to come even a little bit more from the inside as well and start that ball farther to the right", "start": 156.72, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "so i would assume based on what you're saying is if you're on the golf course even your rehearsals would be a little bit more of that feeling like the club's a little more to", "start": 165.76, "duration": 15.840000000000002}
{"chunk": "the right of you and you're just a little more into out yep is that what you're saying exactly okay and i would be the same way if i'm if i'm", "start": 174.08, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "on a t and i see this front right pin and i'm trying to fade it in there you're going to see my my rehearsals be a little bit more this way whereas if i have a back", "start": 181.68, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "left pin you know i got the wind going that way or whatever i'm just going to let it go you know i might feel a little bit of this and feeling like i can swing out to", "start": 190.8, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "the right a little bit more yup so but even in those rehearsals you're not going this way with the face you're making sure that face it's coming more from the", "start": 199.76, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "inside but the face is not twisting a lot right so here we got like uh this black flag out here for a push draw like i would i would not", "start": 209.36, "duration": 18.958}
{"chunk": "be aiming the club face at that black flag i would actually be aiming it you know with this wind right now i'd probably be aiming at the middle of that right bunker for sure right and then and", "start": 218.879, "duration": 19.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "then my body probably around there or leaving a little slightly bit right of there depending how much i want to draw it see i when i hit the push draw i", "start": 228.48, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "don't aim my body more right by moving the ball back that creates that more right start start start line for me right and i can still get the ball up", "start": 236.08, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "when i start aiming right then i the ball flight comes down too much for me i think a lot of people at home that would think just to start aiming more and more right to hit their draw", "start": 245.28, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "chances are i bet if you look it up from face on their face starts getting more and more left to compensate but we know that this is the king and", "start": 254.4, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "this decides where that ball is starting for the most part so we want to make sure that if we're hitting a good push draw", "start": 263.52, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "that face is still lined up actually to the right of the target right yep so better be to the right of the ball is going to go to the left yes", "start": 271.199, "duration": 15.441}
{"chunk": "right anything else you can think of that you do you know maybe the one other thing i might change is like depending on the club i might just stand a touch farther", "start": 279.36, "duration": 18.558}
{"chunk": "away from it okay okay and what that does is it helps make the club just slightly more upright right so if you think about being in a", "start": 287.759, "duration": 17.522000000000002}
{"chunk": "bunker yeah you stand wide you get the handle low and that it helps you get the club face even more open but it also helps", "start": 297.04, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "get the the loft pointed more square and less out to the right right so so it can help you draw it by being a little farther away yep so even", "start": 305.759, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "if i like were even with driver i might just stand just a hair farther away from it but it's not much i mean", "start": 315.039, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "um now on the opposite end like when i'm hitting my fade i try to feel a little bit taller right so so but yeah i would say", "start": 322.4, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "ball position you could play with a little bit i wouldn't go crazy i know a lot of viewers at home they try to put it like you know off their right ear from their", "start": 332.4, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "left ear to the right here just a lot especially with wedges and then it's like what happens is when you the further you put that ball back", "start": 341.199, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "more often than not what i see is the more there's a tilt and a throw yeah because their brain says get it in the", "start": 349.6, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "air right i'd rather have it a little up so i can actually go up and get it and stay down yeah that's how i feel about it but but definitely i would say in the most", "start": 357.6, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "part my ball probably does move a hair back for me i keep this hitting draws i keep it really simple i don't draw my driver so that is", "start": 366.24, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "out of the question it's like against the rules but everything else i'll just move the ball back slightly and then i feel my path just a little from the inside that is", "start": 374.96, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "that's all i don't do anything else there you go all right well let's line up for one here so i'm gonna aim that face", "start": 383.919, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "we're gonna be right the middle of that bunker just right of the black flag and we got a perfect push draw", "start": 391.12, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "wind got a little bit i got to be a little more ripe very good though that was a good shot he ended up six feet left at target let me do those rehearsals this time so you", "start": 404.8, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "can see what we're talking about so i i'd probably be back in here and make a few of these rehearsals like this feeling that club", "start": 413.36, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "to the right of me to the right to the right to the right to the right to the right and right arm sort of under left still yeah versus covering it this way", "start": 422.72, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "because i don't need to snap this ball into my target it's not like i'm hitting a hook around a tree you know you're just you're letting your path", "start": 431.039, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "make the ball curve gently still you see i'm still creating this body rotation to do it yep i'm not stalling", "start": 438.72, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "and throwing it like that help create that drop look pretty good a little release but yeah that went over curved", "start": 447.12, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "yeah just started a little more left because i added just a little loft at the bottom how about a little lower one huh that's the other thing i see with people", "start": 467.52, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "trying to draw is they they add a little bit of this early so they might not be rolling it but they", "start": 476.319, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "because they add loft when you add loft too it points the loft left that can make you go less especially with wedges so so i'm going to feel a little bit of", "start": 484.16, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "that right wrist angle here get that ball started a little lower and that will help it start a little more out to the right as well sure", "start": 492.08, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "got tweed up pretty good too this one i don't want to end up left left of that black flag ooh that was a good one there", "start": 500.639, "duration": 15.923}
{"chunk": "that was like a one-yard draw that was basically straight but that was beautiful okay sweet let's wrap this up henry so", "start": 510.319, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "the keys to hitting that little soft draw without adding in too much roll it's number one ball position let's make sure we're catching it a little bit more on the", "start": 519.36, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "and out part of our arc by moving it back just a fraction i like your rehearsal right here as you're doing it too because you're actually a little bit open to the camera yeah and you're still", "start": 528.0, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "swinging a little and out you're not this way to the camera or with your your stance you know what i'm saying right so you're not pulling", "start": 536.72, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "it over the top so everything you can you're just feeling the rehearsal and that club's coming from the inside to hit that little drop so", "start": 544.24, "duration": 15.52}
