{"chunk": "hey everybody welcome back out to superstition mountain milo here as well as henry fall and today we have a really good lesson for you", "start": 1.199, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "about which direction does the back of our left hand face at impact", "start": 8.72, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "now i've heard many times in my life that we want to make sure the back of our left hand faces the targeted impact have you heard that as well i i've heard a lot", "start": 18.32, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "we've got you off the club right coming with that leading hand and get that shaft lean so oh you've got to have the back of the left hand facing", "start": 26.4, "duration": 15.119000000000002}
{"chunk": "your target and that may or not may or may not be true right well i mean you look at a lot of players today and", "start": 34.399, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "their glove logo the back of their left hand is actually facing the camera where it is now okay forward on yet those players still probably have", "start": 42.719, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "the shaft lean that they need to be able to produce the ball flight that they want right yeah so how are they able to do that well i think part of it's grip", "start": 51.28, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "right you're starting to see more and more stronger or at least neutral grips on tor number one for sure so the grip definitely plays a role", "start": 58.559, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "in where we want the back of our left hand to face at impact correct yeah okay awesome", "start": 67.439, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "what other things might dictate that well i think what we talked about for off camera was getting your left hand back to where it began right", "start": 74.56, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "or obviously it's going to move a little bit forward if we have good impact conditions so the handle is going to be more forward but the direction that this hand faces", "start": 84.32, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "needs to stay the same because we want the face to more or less be the same right right so if my left hand starts strong like this and i wind up with the back of my left", "start": 93.119, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "hand pointing at the target you can see that club face is nowhere near pointed where i want it that's no bueno right in there i wouldn't be able to get it to point", "start": 101.2, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "there would be no loft on the golf club right so if that's my grip i better not get the back of my left hand to point at the target right and i think you and i are kind of in the same boat we both have", "start": 109.28, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "fairly strong left hand grips but when our arms hang where is that glove logo pointing this point back to the camera so when i", "start": 117.92, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "grip it it's pretty much right there yeah so again if i were to return it here ping logo being back down at the target", "start": 126.24, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "that face is dead left so you're seeing more and more guys like tommy fleetwood's a great one to look at where he has a strong left hand", "start": 134.239, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "and when he returns to impact yes the handle is forward but that logo is basically in the same angle so if you have a strong grip at a dress", "start": 142.08, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "you probably have a little cup in your in your wrist right yep and at impact that that will be aiming the same direction but that cup's probably gone", "start": 152.16, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "right so you're not going to have that bowed wrist look it'll just be more flattened out but still pointed the same direction so i brought a really long golf tee here so i can show", "start": 161.28, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "this so as henry sets up here we can see the direction of that logo at address it's pointing kind of out that way now", "start": 169.599, "duration": 21.202}
{"chunk": "where would impact be for you whoops so you can see that's still pointing the same way it didn't change it just moved forward", "start": 180.08, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "and maybe the handle came up just a little bit but it's the same now let's say you were a really weak grip player which i teach a few really weak grip players", "start": 189.04, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "and their impact position is definitely different right so here you are set up that logo is now pointed more that way and what is that", "start": 197.599, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "going to look like at impact yeah so it's still pointed the same direction but now that wrist is more flattened out yeah now i've even got a couple who have a", "start": 206.64, "duration": 15.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "lot weaker grip than that so i've got a couple students whose grip looks like this i just don't want to grip it that way yeah for me it's very awkward and", "start": 214.0, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "uncomfortable but a couple of these kids are you know they're about as good as i am already yeah well you look at a guy like jordan", "start": 222.879, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "spieth who has a weaker left hand right and when he's hitting great wedge shots that left hand is pointing more or the", "start": 230.48, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "back of the left hand is pointing more towards the target yeah and he has that shaft lean and that's i mean that's part of the reason he's such a great wedge player and", "start": 238.64, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "you've seen that um in other players throughout history but you're also seeing guys that have the stronger grips that are returning it to where it was", "start": 246.959, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "so it's not necessarily a fundamental for us to get the back of our left hand pointing at the target you know anything that where i'm having to like consciously", "start": 255.28, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "rotate or um i don't know flick or adjust my hand coming into the ball to make that logo match up to what has been told to me in", "start": 263.199, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "the past it's just i feel like that's an unnecessary movement why not just return to where it was and make sure our face angle which is", "start": 273.04, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "probably the most important thing is right awesome so well hopefully you all liked this lesson and if you did subscribe to this channel", "start": 281.28, "duration": 19.36}
