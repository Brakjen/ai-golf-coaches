{"chunk": "so we're gonna call this the zombie walk zombie walk so what the zombie walk looks like is we're gonna make our arms go completely limp", "start": 0.0, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "and we're gonna figure out how to make our arms move hey guys welcome rocket nation this is", "start": 8.559, "duration": 17.922}
{"chunk": "our ig live we're doing so we're going to cover sort of one topic really for the first sort of 10 minutes of this ig live and it's really going to be talking", "start": 22.08, "duration": 19.279}
{"chunk": "about flow milo okay something you're sort of famous for at this point no i'm not i'm not famous for anything so in that sort of that tour like flow", "start": 31.119, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "you see probably at those guys at bay hill this week right but we're going to show you how to build it up at home so you can take it", "start": 41.36, "duration": 15.438}
{"chunk": "to the golf course milo take us away so in order to build flow first thing we have to do is understand what it even is", "start": 48.559, "duration": 18.642}
{"chunk": "so what flow is it's getting the pressure to move from foot to foot", "start": 57.6, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "leading the motion of our body and our arms and the golf club okay so the first little drill we wanted to do", "start": 65.76, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "we just we just came up with a nickname on the fly on the fly and what was the nickname there henry okay so we're gonna call this the zombie", "start": 74.72, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "walk zombie walk so what the zombie walk looks like is we're going to make our arms go completely limp and we're going to figure out", "start": 82.88, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "how to make our arms move by making our body move okay", "start": 91.759, "duration": 16.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "so you've got to figure out how to do that if you can do that without using the muscles in your arms so you're just your arms are completely", "start": 100.72, "duration": 15.838}
{"chunk": "limp and your body is creating the motion then you're on your way so your arms are kind of like noodles and they're just along for the ride", "start": 108.399, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "right yeah at this point they're just noodles they're ropes along for the ride okay so why are we stepping why what's what's going on here talk us through", "start": 116.0, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "that so the the stepping is moving pressure from side to side so we're actually shifting our mass just a little bit and then we're going to", "start": 123.6, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "convert that into a little rotary force naturally like this so you're not and when you do those steps you're not", "start": 132.48, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "infinitely going this way or that way you see there's no like lunge to it i'm still staying pretty centered and the reason being for that is as you", "start": 140.8, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "step it's actually pushing you back the other way it's a you're putting pressure in the ground and that force is pushing your", "start": 150.56, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "upper body back the other way so naturally when i go to step this way the pressure's in this foot but i begin to fall back the other way", "start": 158.48, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "and then the pressure hits this foot and i begin to fall back the other way so the pressure is creating a little fall from side to side and for you guys at home if you go to", "start": 167.28, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "the driving range you could actually do some little warm-ups like this the golf club and see how wide my arms stay", "start": 175.44, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "and just doing a little pressure shift so we're calling that a zombie walk that's the zombie walk yeah okay once we can do the zombie walk then", "start": 184.0, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "let's introduce a golf club so now we're doing the same zombie walk but we're doing it with the club in our", "start": 192.48, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "hand so as his club is going up here he sees stepping so he's he's counteracting", "start": 201.92, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "that club he's going the opposite direction of that club right constantly constantly going the opposite of the golf club that's what puts energy back into the golf club to", "start": 209.92, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "make it change direction so in my backswing just like in a real golf swing when i start to get this club you know somewhere up in here i'm actually", "start": 218.72, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "beginning to go back the other way yes i don't keep going off to the right just like in the downswing and the through swing i don't", "start": 226.319, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "keep going to the left i actually get pushed back that's why you see that sort of tour like finish right yeah so you're constantly pushing", "start": 234.799, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "opposite of where you want the golf club to go and once you understand kind of how to get the", "start": 243.92, "duration": 15.760999999999997}
{"chunk": "the zombie walk going or that dance step going it becomes fairly easy to start growing it into more yeah so once we can do it with the club", "start": 251.36, "duration": 18.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "without any hinges then we can start adding in an element of of hinge so now the club's going to", "start": 260.4, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "start to have some flow to it as well okay well let's take a step back let's do some little ones some little zombie walks where i'm not hinging so my arms", "start": 268.08, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "are still you know relatively straight but there's not a lot of tension here i'm not holding this club like really firmly we want your arms to be very relaxed and", "start": 276.479, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "the shoulders loose and i'm actually sorry i heard something and i'm actually going to start this club out at the net here and then do a little step step", "start": 284.72, "duration": 20.879}
{"chunk": "step step and just chip one so you see how wide that arc is too as i did that perfect", "start": 294.0, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "so i'll do it one more time show us that once again and again these are just little little half swings it's a good way to kind of", "start": 302.72, "duration": 17.922}
{"chunk": "build some awareness from hip high to hip high without you know adding any hit adding any force taking some of the tension out and that's the key when", "start": 312.639, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "you're doing this you're not adding a late hit with your hands and arms yeah you're just relaxed and allowing the momentum to", "start": 320.4, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "work for you okay milo now we're gonna start to add a hinge another lever basically to the golf swing so talk us through the hinge and how that gets", "start": 328.08, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "added into this so this is where we begin to put speed into the system without really adding muscle so what's happening is", "start": 338.08, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "as i toss this club with more energy i begin to allow it to set my wrists in this manner and so you can start off with little", "start": 346.32, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "ones i don't want to kill you there henry but you can see how the changing of direction is beginning to set my wrists", "start": 354.72, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "on both sides so momentum sets your wrist for you you don't set your wrists you let the momentum do", "start": 361.68, "duration": 16.400999999999996}
{"chunk": "it yeah and when it happens in that way you don't have to really worry about where the golf club goes because it goes where momentum takes it", "start": 371.44, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "now wait a minute you're telling me that the club is going to get in certain positions just based on our sort of flow and sequence that's", "start": 379.039, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "what you're telling me that's what i'm telling you and that's what the best players in the world are doing they're understanding", "start": 387.68, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "how to athletically get the club to move where they want it to versus forcing it into positions right yes okay", "start": 394.96, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "so and that's what i like about this little this little drill you know it looks funny if you guys did this on the driving range you'd probably get some looks", "start": 404.96, "duration": 16.398}
{"chunk": "but you'd have an awareness and understanding that this move right here drives that club up for you just like if i was going to throw this club into our", "start": 413.039, "duration": 18.082}
{"chunk": "neighbor's yard here that little press and turn that that set it up yep and just like the fall back would bring the club back", "start": 422.16, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "down for me so then the club's going to find its plane on the way down because of what's happening with the fall and how pressure moves you don't", "start": 431.12, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "have to manually move it anywhere okay so let's do let's try one with a little hinge now so it's probably going to be what would you say two-thirds", "start": 439.599, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "three-quarter swing now it looks like three-quarter you see i'm adding a little hinge now a little looser in those ribs", "start": 448.0, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "good okay i'm not so worried about the contact here you know hey you might shank one here you might thin one top it right into the net", "start": 456.319, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "or on the driving range but the point is i'm getting awareness of using my core my lower body the stuff that really", "start": 465.68, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "should be driving our golf swing versus hands and arms so much right we'll do it again that's starting to look like a golf", "start": 473.759, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "swing now right that's a golf swing yep now the next piece of the puzzle is how do we begin to turn it into a swing where", "start": 486.96, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "we're not walking from three feet back to the ball exactly although i might hit it better that way maybe i should just stick with that", "start": 495.84, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "right might be it might be your thing all right so so you're saying how do we make it more stationary right yeah but", "start": 502.879, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "still keep the flow still keep the pressure shifts and some of that footwork too because that's another thing that was going on here i was gaining an awareness", "start": 511.199, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "of where my pressure is kind of going in my feet for sure right and the timing of it right so you're starting to feel how to time it yeah and i can tell you i've", "start": 520.8, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "spent whole hours with people trying to just figure out this because for many people this is it's complicated this is like learning a", "start": 529.839, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "new dance and they can't it's tough yeah but if you look at any sport you know just like throwing a football football is going back my lead legs", "start": 537.68, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "going down yeah it's natural so there's a counteracting and it's just the sequence we're just that's what we're trying to get through to you guys here", "start": 545.44, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "so okay why don't i do one i'm gonna still keep stepping but just sort of stepping right here so swinging the club towards the net", "start": 552.88, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "step so i can just do some of these little you know if this was so this is a pitching wedge we're talking this ball is going 50 60", "start": 560.72, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "yards probably right now i could just build this up yep so now i'm not even really moving my feet", "start": 570.56, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "that much and i could even whittle this down to just some little heel raises right and that's the next step i take people into", "start": 578.08, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "is i do some little heel taps all right it's like that okay good now i'm going to add one little element", "start": 588.08, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "to this that i know you like and that is a trigger okay well this is the trigger it's just", "start": 600.399, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "once we set up the club behind the ball you can't move the club forward or you'll move the ball forward so you've got to do something with your body to", "start": 608.16, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "get the system moving so you're going to start with a little it's almost like you're going forward but you're going to do it without the", "start": 616.56, "duration": 16.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "golf club you're going to let the club stay there and let your body go forward whether it be a little counter rotation or what i do is more of a little", "start": 625.68, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "pressure shift so i bump myself to the left and then i go to the right so you have actually your mass moves just a little bit i let me let my mass move to my left foot a little bit and then i", "start": 633.68, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "kick it back and you rotate it right so you could think of this for you guys that work out in the gym and you do the some type of cable pull", "start": 642.56, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "you don't just merely pull it like that you actually move into it first to pull that cable back it makes it a lot easier right", "start": 651.36, "duration": 16.238}
{"chunk": "exactly so okay so basically what i was doing before was starting it out here so you're just saying without actually putting the club", "start": 659.519, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "out that way feel like i do that with my body right and that's my trigger so i'm going to kind of do these little heel taps again", "start": 668.079, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "trigger go so now i'm starting to feel that flow i can feel it in my feet and i have an awareness of what's going on down here versus so much my hands and", "start": 675.279, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "arms that's pretty good right and i bet if i slow that video down and watched it i bet i would see a", "start": 685.68, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "little action in my feet too you know even maybe a little heel raise my left foot i'm gonna do it again", "start": 693.92, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "you should use that trigger that's my trick you like that yeah i like it i kind of went my head kind of probably went a little more i liked it it's good", "start": 705.36, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "um so milo we also have a kettlebell out here so maybe there's something we could do at home to kind of rehearse this as well", "start": 711.76, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "well this kettlebell's dual function it's keeping this mat from flying away when you smack the ground but this one's super heavy", "start": 721.12, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "i don't know if i would recommend using something this heavy this thing's like 25 pounds or something i just wanted to test you but you can start to feel", "start": 729.68, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "how your body counters the weight of this kettlebell and again i want to point out to you guys how centered he's staying", "start": 738.0, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "you see that kettlebell is moving down now the other way he's not because that kettlebell is heavy he's really having to work hard for it right but he's pressure shifting", "start": 746.88, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "it's keeping him fairly centered he's not wandering off into our pool over here or there's a wall behind me i can't let my mass continue to go because i need enough", "start": 756.16, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "mass to offset this weight yeah this thing's heavy so i've got to start moving my mass back the other way as this", "start": 764.32, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "kettlebell gets to about here my mass has to start going the other way otherwise i'm going that way yeah so that's a great exercise you guys can", "start": 771.68, "duration": 17.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "do maybe use a little less weight but great exercise you can do to sort of build up that that flow the pressure shifts and", "start": 780.88, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "you know you're also turning as you're doing it i think that's one thing we we haven't really mentioned yet um you know i did say he's not moving", "start": 789.12, "duration": 16.238}
{"chunk": "you know laterally or linear linear uh for a long period of time he's he's centering up well the key to that is", "start": 796.399, "duration": 15.442}
{"chunk": "i turn that linear motion into a rotation that's what keeps me from wandering that way", "start": 804.32, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "so i can convert it into rotation okay so milo i'm going to do one more just to show them and i want you to talk them through the", "start": 812.959, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "swing set key that you gave in a lesson the other day which i really like and you can mention that so here i go", "start": 821.76, "duration": 15.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "okay so what i talked about in this lesson was how the transition is very much like", "start": 830.16, "duration": 19.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "swinging on a swing as a kid and there's a feeling of weightlessness so when you get to here for just a split second that", "start": 839.12, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "that kettlebell is just kind of floating there right yep and you don't pull it down so you don't get to hear that makes it impossible it's heavy", "start": 847.44, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "but you don't get to hear and change directions abruptly the change of direction is it's", "start": 856.959, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "smooth well how many times have you heard people say when they were playing well they could feel the club face they could feel the weight of the club head", "start": 865.839, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "right because they're i mean if i was just doing some little short shots if i started to pull and do anything any manipulation", "start": 874.399, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "you know that's when yips would come in right so just like in the full swing if there's that momentary pause where i'm", "start": 883.68, "duration": 15.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "transitioning or the club just sort of stays up there then some great things start to happen that's key the club comes up and it", "start": 891.199, "duration": 15.042}
{"chunk": "naturally runs out of steam and then changes directions you don't grab it because if you do", "start": 899.12, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "then your transition is really quick snatchy the club breaks down it makes your wrist break down a lot of things get out of whack cool", "start": 907.76, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "all right milo is there anything else you want to mention about i guess flow and sequence and pressure shifts no i think we covered some good little drills", "start": 916.0, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "you guys can do exercises um you know try out a kettlebell and when you're in the gym too if you guys are working out that's a great time to", "start": 925.199, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "understand you know what muscles should be sort of activating these movements for sure yeah a lot of the tour pros are doing that when you do it under weight you can feel", "start": 934.32, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "it a little better i like to do it in other sports too go grab a bat grab a ball and go throw it yeah just see how", "start": 943.279, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "you move and then try to apply those same principles to your golf swing and thanks for joining us have a good night", "start": 951.199, "duration": 16.559}
