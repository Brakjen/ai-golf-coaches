{"chunk": "and so now as you start to swing back if I push that cap down did you feel how that yeah kind of levers that club up for you", "start": 0.199, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "and I'm kind of sequence as you did that I was kind of sequencing it with a little pressure shift and my wind up so it's like whoosh that club head is", "start": 8.679, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "becoming very light early yeah now be real smooth so I can get out of the way ready go that was so stinking pure", "start": 16.68, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "hey everyone so today we're going to be sharing with you this dive move this simple wrist action that you guys should add in your takeaway and the top players in the world are doing this move Milo", "start": 30.84, "duration": 18.199}
{"chunk": "for sure so welcome back out to Superstition Mountain Henry let's talk a little bit about what this move is yeah so you see it with some of the best players in the world they're they're", "start": 39.84, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "even doing this little drill where they sort of establish the structure they want and then from there it's almost just wind up and unwind so what we see", "start": 47.719, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "is a lot of great players actually you know do this drill an exercise where they have it established and they they basically talk about the golf swing", "start": 56.8, "duration": 16.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "being done which is kind of crazy to think about but once they have that structure again it just becomes as simple as you know wind it up and unwind", "start": 64.799, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "and this is a drill we do a lot with students just to get the structure built right and then", "start": 74.759, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "go so kind of makes the golf swing pretty simple in that understanding we get our wrist conditions the arm structure established right and then we can just sort of wind", "start": 82.24, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "up and unwind let things happen so Milo there's obviously numerous amounts of matchups we've seen across uh the golfing landscape so to speak what about", "start": 92.04, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "this first phase so I've seen players who almost let their hands go up and forward first yeah I've seen players", "start": 101.84, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "almost drag the handle first and then everything in the middle so kind of loading it early and like Dustin Johnson's hands kind of do", "start": 110.04, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "this and like DJ it's almost like the club Works a little out off that Target line so if this is your ball line or Target line it's like that club is", "start": 131.959, "duration": 19.721}
{"chunk": "moving actually out in front of it uhhuh and then conversely you said some guys where the hands might go out a little bit the club rolls a little bit under", "start": 141.44, "duration": 18.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah and then there's the the guys who don't hinge it early and almost drag it back inside more yeah like some of the old timer is like so much more much more", "start": 151.28, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "with the wind up yep the whole Spectrum but some at some stage we're still establishing those risk conditions right for sure everybody you got to get your", "start": 160.319, "duration": 18.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "risk loaded at some point my preference is to get them loaded a little sooner get it taken care of while things are moving slower rather than waiting", "start": 169.56, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "waiting waiting and then having it load late hard I'd prefer to see it kind of just be a smooth loading off the ball mhm not that that's the one way to do it", "start": 177.68, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "cuz I've seen others who don't so more or less seeing a like a 90 with the left arm shafts or left arm parallel left arm", "start": 186.48, "duration": 16.76}
{"chunk": "parallel basically 90 but we're sort of building that structure as we're going back yeah like smoothly loading to that point Y", "start": 195.04, "duration": 17.959999999999997}
{"chunk": "so what we talk about a little bit what I've I've often said is that it feels like what I call a dive move so if you think of Michael Phelps or a swimmer", "start": 212.28, "duration": 20.44}
{"chunk": "diving off those blocks into the pool Michael tries to enter the water at the lowest angle possible the goal is to have the entire body they're kind of", "start": 222.239, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "going into that water smoothly so they can keep that up that acceleration that speed they need off the blocks it's just smooth right right and they're kind of", "start": 232.12, "duration": 18.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "gliding in there and I I kind of compare that to how the right wrist works I kind of want to build that structure smoothly", "start": 241.079, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "and sequence it so that club is then set the angles are set and the club's sort of in front of me so if you're looking for more of just a simple way of doing", "start": 248.64, "duration": 17.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "it this can really establish that for you if you find that you know maybe moving a little too out or to in is complicating things for you just a", "start": 257.919, "duration": 19.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "little bit of this feeling can sort of simplify that Focus yeah I really like that feeling one way that I've done this with players is I'll have them set up", "start": 267.96, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "and I'll grab onto the cap of the golf club and as they get started I'll take the cap and and feel like I almost push the cap down okay and you can see how", "start": 276.08, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "that naturally loads that right hand just like that why don't you do that to me so I'm going to have both hands on you can have both hands on or just the right one it doesn't matter okay go with", "start": 285.56, "duration": 18.199}
{"chunk": "both and so now as you start to swing back if I push that cap down did you feel how that kind of levers that club up for you and", "start": 294.56, "duration": 15.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "I'm kind of sequence as you did that I was kind of sequencing it with a little pressure shift and my wind up so it's like whoosh that club's that club is", "start": 303.84, "duration": 18.519}
{"chunk": "becoming or Club head is becoming very light early yes right so often we see the club get heavy early whether it's in", "start": 312.88, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "or sometimes even out it's like either direction if the club gets misaligned from your hands so this club's heavy this club's heavy and they both are heavy to get to the top yeah where if", "start": 321.039, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "you get it moving more into this Arc that club feels like it's taking you to the top it's it's moving you versus you having to move it yeah so let's mil", "start": 330.639, "duration": 19.962}
{"chunk": "let's show them this from face on again so I'm going to grip down a little bit just so you the viewer can see where he's going to be sort of touching the B", "start": 340.84, "duration": 16.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "of that club so you're going to I'm going to do a little of that that really stood it up so feel that you want to hit one I could", "start": 348.4, "duration": 18.278}
{"chunk": "yeah let me uh let me get the feeling a couple more times cuz it's it's sending it almost more up than I'm used to uhhuh but again", "start": 363.56, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "for somebody that might be in under it's an exaggeration but it gets the club really stood up so it's very light right so you think of like a baseball player", "start": 372.24, "duration": 15.399999999999999}
{"chunk": "like tipping the bat that would be kind of the feel right so we're making that that mass much lighter earlier so then when in transition we can shallow it and", "start": 380.319, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "it can almost become a little heavier you a lot of great players have talked about feeling the club head yeah in transition versus so many of you guys get in here and whoosh right out of the", "start": 389.72, "duration": 19.438000000000002}
{"chunk": "top you got yeah yeah so these can go together again why the takeaway and the back swing and our in our opinion can", "start": 398.639, "duration": 15.842000000000002}
{"chunk": "still be important you know I I think it's I like to call it setting The Dominoes up yeah if you get them out of order it's very hard to knock them all down but if we get things into the right", "start": 406.84, "duration": 18.678}
{"chunk": "order you know it kind of becomes almost autopilot so it it becomes more challenging it's not impossible no there's guys who do everything and do it successfully okay let's do this a couple", "start": 416.319, "duration": 19.121}
{"chunk": "more times so grip down okay one more okay this going to be able to move out of the way fast enough we're going", "start": 425.759, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "to see if I got wheels maybe start on this side of the rod trip you're good ready okay I'm going to see if I can even hit this just go smooth so I can be quick", "start": 434.56, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "enough oh that really stood it up wow that felt Goofy that was my golf swing that's what I do", "start": 443.4, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "yeah let's film that from down the line so I can see that all right here we go give me two two more practice two rehearsals get", "start": 458.36, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "ready okay I think I got a little more sequence now I almost got to lay off the grip pressure now be real smooth so I", "start": 465.84, "duration": 15.639}
{"chunk": "can get out of the way ready go that was so stinking pure I mean could you hit it better see if anything", "start": 473.319, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "it's more out than my normal takeaway more stood up now the out the club in front let me put a line down for them so", "start": 481.68, "duration": 19.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "here's our here's our ball line Target Line This is just parallel you know we're building our railroad when I take this club back with this feel the club", "start": 491.44, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "is staying a little in front of my hands when we say in front it's on this side of my hand so you see that the club is you know more or less on the ball line", "start": 500.72, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "for the first few feet and then working up the arc and that's because it's breaking up a little bit more than normal for you it's yeah so it keeps it on the front side of your hands until", "start": 510.52, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "the club becomes above your the club head becomes above your hands then it finally gets behind your hands right so as that's happening I'm not pushing my", "start": 519.719, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "hands out to that line and that's one of the killers we see so often is we see students who try to get this club in", "start": 528.2, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "front of them but push their hands and arm sort of out away from them so then if you look at that you can see how much separation you're creating here so you", "start": 536.24, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "know we're not ones to always talk about connection but you better believe you're super disconnected now so Henry we're really not fans of keeping the arms", "start": 545.8, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "really tied to us but we're also not fans of having the arms getting away from our body too much and having to", "start": 554.72, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "create big Loops that's what we see so often it's like especially firsttime students of ours that maybe have seen our content online they they see the the", "start": 562.839, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "loop the circle right and they think they start doing this at the house at the at home right then they come see us", "start": 572.0, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "in person and they actually are looping the arms they're not looping the mass of the club yeah so that's a a really a key distinguishment here we're not", "start": 579.959, "duration": 17.321}
{"chunk": "encouraging you guys to push those hands and arms out get it stood up and then shallow it with the hands and arms now you're just making a big old Circle for", "start": 589.0, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "yourself with your hands and that's super Troublesome so we'd rather the hands actually stay in a little bit Club", "start": 597.399, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "stands up now you're getting that little that little loop we're talking about and then if anything the hands for the best players in the world are tending to move", "start": 605.079, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "actually out yeah on that plane we don't really like them to move back and down no no no no so this dive move we're establishing", "start": 612.64, "duration": 19.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "that structure so now we get it built we can just wind up to the top we have the angles we want at the top so here you go", "start": 630.2, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "dive top and then we can just simply go down around and unwind out of the way I just want to hit a couple where we we", "start": 639.92, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "set that so similar to when you did it for me mhm I'm going to set it kind of this is what we we call sort of the Nick Faldo drill and Nick Faldo was kind of", "start": 649.36, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "famous for this exercise now what I'm going to do is set my hands here without moving them backwards right the way to the full set position set the wrist", "start": 658.48, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "there and all we have to do now is just continue turning just turn those shoulders so we wind it up left shoulder under and look at that that's the best", "start": 668.0, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "top of the back swing position you're ever going to be in your life absolutely spot on now what we will do is hit it from that position we will set it to", "start": 676.32, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "there check everything for a split second turn and release we might do it a little differently with the wrist angles and you know partly because of the way", "start": 684.72, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "we grip the club but establishing that sort of parallel with the ground early so a lot of students we see don't really", "start": 693.76, "duration": 17.961}
{"chunk": "get their wrists involved correctly till really late and then they're throwing it out early out the top yeah when they when they don't get their wrists involved they get their elbows involved", "start": 702.8, "duration": 16.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "yeah and they start pulling the golf club back across themselves so I'd much rather see those wrists loading yeah so", "start": 711.959, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "we're establishing that early and again that's that that dive when we think about a swimmer going off the blocks into the water and that's that right", "start": 719.92, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "wrist extending the other benefit I've noticed with this is it kind of keeps the right arm a little long early mhm if we establish this structure keeps the", "start": 727.8, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "right arm a little wider when you don't set the angles with your wrists we often see the fold yep I think a lot of times people think of width as just keeping", "start": 736.72, "duration": 20.401}
{"chunk": "the club head away from themselves where for me what width really is is how far away that blue cap is from me so if I", "start": 746.6, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "can keep that that's actually farther away than that right so that this is actually more width and more power well and you you can still have width with", "start": 756.68, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "angles and structure when width breaks down it's more the arms folding yeah so if I did this that feels like it's", "start": 765.6, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "really far away from me but that's not width yeah what I'm going to do here is sort of preset this hinge so I'm going to feel that little dive move you notice", "start": 774.519, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "my hands aren't really moving much positionally no I'm pretty much setting the hinge right in front of me basically the grip of this club isn't moving you", "start": 783.639, "duration": 20.601}
{"chunk": "know one way or the other it's just it's kind of here now I'm just going to feel wind up unwind and go okay let's see", "start": 793.72, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "that let's see if I can do it let's just start slow with one so a little D move", "start": 801.72, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "all right pretty good so you could just start with some slow ones like that another feel I like to do is get alignment stick up the shaft feels a", "start": 809.92, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "little goofy at first to grip it but I'll have them kind of ride this shaft down their left thigh to get it set up", "start": 818.24, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "yep okay so ride this shaft down the left thigh you notice again hands stay a little in club a little out if it comes off either", "start": 826.519, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "direction I'm starting to get that sort of Disconnect starting to get out of my Bend yeah so I've lost that structure you're adding complexity right so let's do", "start": 834.92, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "another little one like this so I'm going to go dive move to there it's riding down my thigh and then up to the", "start": 844.36, "duration": 15.799000000000001}
{"chunk": "top and Chip one okay good I wouldn't hit these very hard but that's another good exercise to get your takeway established for sure and we also", "start": 851.36, "duration": 19.277}
{"chunk": "have the the T rotation stick can do the same thing it's just a little nicer that you can kind of connect it to the end of the club right yeah a little less", "start": 871.279, "duration": 18.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "difficult to grip with that cuz it's not running through your fingers you do have to grip down just a little cuz it goes on the butt but same idea and you can", "start": 880.6, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "hit balls a little further with this I found but we can get that structure up to the top and Chip one so even a little thin like that I'm", "start": 888.639, "duration": 20.281}
{"chunk": "okay with let me hit one more good you just make little Swings with these drills and you start to establish", "start": 900.32, "duration": 15.918000000000001}
{"chunk": "that structure you're looking for so then you can hit more of a fuller one like we see from a guy like Rory or Justin Thomas or Nick FDO again these", "start": 910.839, "duration": 19.401}
{"chunk": "are some great players who have used a similar exercise where they sort of set it and forget it right y set it", "start": 920.199, "duration": 18.919}
{"chunk": "and go not bad a little left but pretty good okay so if you're a player who struggles with arms getting", "start": 932.0, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "disconnected arms moving in the wrong way club club getting way out of whack this dive move feel the feeling of the", "start": 940.88, "duration": 16.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "handle kind of loading down as the wrists kind of stand the club up can be a very good feeling to just get things", "start": 949.44, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "lined up and simplify the ACT for you mhm you can start with the F drill where you're pre-loading it and then you can", "start": 957.079, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "learn I actually like to to grab it with just my right hand and put my fingers on the grip of the club and I feel like as I start the club away I", "start": 965.92, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "push that down and then that gives me the feeling of the nice little dive move that you've described to everybody so", "start": 975.72, "duration": 15.117999999999999}
{"chunk": "this move can be very good for simplifying wrist action arm action and just getting things tied together a little bit better hey guys thanks for watching really appreciate it make sure", "start": 983.639, "duration": 17.242}
