{"chunk": "were trying to get you to be a little later my MAX Pressure right was right here the club hadn't even moved yet so you went and you got fairly good amount", "start": 180.78, "duration": 17.698999999999998}
{"chunk": "of pressure you were up in the 80s the thing they got to realize as they watch this is the difference between weight", "start": 189.599, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "and prep mass and pressure okay maybe too many times the the words weight transfer or weight shift have been thrown out there yeah it's really let's", "start": 196.08, "duration": 18.06}
{"chunk": "look at the pressure that we're moving exactly and and my pressure reaches Max to the trail side", "start": 206.4, "duration": 17.219}

{"chunk": "only is the pressure getting right early but the pressure because we're applying that pressure on the diagonal Direction", "start": 230.519, "duration": 16.502000000000002}
{"chunk": "it's pushing us back sending you back to the middle so I like to think that I told you off camera I", "start": 238.76, "duration": 15.099}
{"chunk": "kind of think of it like a speed skater so when I do speed skaters in the gym when I land", "start": 246.9, "duration": 15.299999999999999}

{"chunk": "land the pressure I'm applying is on a diagonal so if I'm doing it quickly it's going to push me back so it's almost like I'm hitting I'm landing on a wall", "start": 262.38, "duration": 19.26}
{"chunk": "this way for a diagonal and then it's boom boom boom boom boom and you can go fast and keeps me rather centered if you", "start": 272.4, "duration": 16.859}
{"chunk": "notice your upper body doesn't move around all that much it's a good analogy towards yeah how we use our our legs in that golf swing so this is what you see", "start": 281.34, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "in the top players is that their pressure is moving into their right foot or Trail foot fairly early on in the", "start": 290.82, "duration": 15.419999999999998}
{"chunk": "golf swing and they're using it to push themselves back to their middle and left side earlier for sure way earlier than the average", "start": 298.44, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "amateur now there's different pressure traces for different players some players get more pressure into their Trail side and the ones that get more", "start": 307.44, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "pressure usually get get it there later but even still by the time they've arrived at the change of direction of", "start": 316.5, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "the golf club the top of the backswing they are back around 50 50 generally so they they started back forward and", "start": 325.02, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "they're back 50 50 under their feet and then where do we tend to see the max lead side pressure would you say for longer hitters earlier so you're going", "start": 333.419, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "to see lead side pressure max out somewhere just above arm parallel for the longest in the", "start": 342.66, "duration": 16.46}
{"chunk": "downswing and for the more normal professionals somewhere right around left arm parallel so usually you know right around left arm parallel", "start": 350.28, "duration": 17.258}
{"chunk": "that's where you're really the pressure max out when you stop yourself from falling because the transition is not", "start": 359.699, "duration": 15.062}
{"chunk": "necessarily level it's actually we're falling down ah downshift yeah there you go and that's a good title for it", "start": 366.06, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "because again I think there's a misconception out there that they're trying to get their weight Mass left", "start": 374.759, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "and I think they think that they should be doing it at impact I should get all my pressure and weight on my left side at impact when in reality when you look", "start": 383.94, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "at the tour Pros their pressure is actually starting to go back the other way at impact by impact they're already in the direction they're going back yeah", "start": 393.3, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "so you got to get left sooner and you got to push off your right side sooner pushing off your right side late to get", "start": 400.68, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "to your left at impact that's the look we see the other biggest problem I saw with our 10 students was very little", "start": 408.84, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "vertical pressure change and what that tells you is that there's no change in in their their height or their Center of mass never Falls yeah because when you", "start": 417.18, "duration": 16.739}
{"chunk": "if you want to have big verticals you have to have a fall so you can stop it just like if you want to have pressure on your right foot you've got to stop it because there's a lot of power in that", "start": 426.24, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "that's a huge speed producer and it's also helpful for being able to rotate so if you're if you're not falling you're probably going to have a hard time", "start": 434.22, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "rotating it's just like you talk about like a a figure skater or if I told you to to jump and twirl as much as you can", "start": 442.68, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "in one jump well I can't do much from just standing here I have to lower first yeah and then I can really crank myself around for", "start": 451.38, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "sure so the lowering is a big part of it again downshift so let's do a few practice Swings with it just so they can", "start": 460.199, "duration": 15.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "see how it works I like to kind of get rocking first before I even start swinging so you can see my feet", "start": 467.4, "duration": 15.901}
{"chunk": "are countering the motion in the club right my left foot you can see the board is down on my lead side now that's going to", "start": 475.56, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "swing the club back around now as the club is approaching the peak point on this side I'm going to start going the other way yeah you call", "start": 487.02, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "it a swing set a little bit of a swing set kind of motion there's a lot of flow in this too now", "start": 495.419, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "look at my chest and head Milo am I moving a lot side to side not a ton so I'm fairly centered and stacked up through the middle of my", "start": 503.4, "duration": 19.019}
{"chunk": "body but you can see I'm moving pressure if I was really moving my math I would have a hard time to get back there it's probably going to happen a lot later", "start": 512.339, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "because I almost got to collect myself you better have a very slow transition", "start": 521.599, "duration": 15.362}
{"chunk": "so you give yourself time to recover that's hard for me to do yeah especially for me because my max pressure is like", "start": 528.42, "duration": 18.038}
{"chunk": "to the right right there yeah and then I'm back okay you're going back left by the time the club is moved you're going back left I think that's part of the", "start": 538.019, "duration": 16.682}
{"chunk": "reason my backswing I energize it so quickly yeah you know I have a lot of velocity off the ball your backswing has", "start": 546.54, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "more swing speed than most people's swings okay Milo so I showed a little bit show me the down part though that's what we", "start": 554.82, "duration": 17.1}
{"chunk": "want to see and why and why it's so important okay so let me get this thing moving that's the down right there so as I go", "start": 562.92, "duration": 15.5}
{"chunk": "to push that down while the club in my arms are still working up I'm falling down while the club and the arms are still", "start": 574.68, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "working up I'm falling down so you're opposing basically you're creating that stretch that's yeah it's helping me", "start": 583.56, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "create a stretch in my arms so then I can sling them so as I'm winding up I'm stretching I'm creating a big stretch", "start": 592.019, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "now I'm changing directions and then I can unload what I just stretched out just like any athletic movement if I'm going to jump", "start": 600.54, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "you know stretching and then Contracting and jumping up it's the same thing so when you made that down not only is your foot", "start": 609.899, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "moving more into that board pressuring but to me I also saw some knee Flex I saw some hip hinge your chest kind of", "start": 618.54, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "lowered your head lowered my Mass hopefully is reaching its highest point sometime just before I change directions", "start": 626.399, "duration": 16.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "yeah so I'm going up now my entire Mass is dropping yeah and so it's there's added Flex in the knees added Hip Flex", "start": 633.36, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "in the hips and my spine is going from extended to flexed all that's happening it's creating a lot of downforce that I can catch myself", "start": 642.24, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "with convert it into shoot it back up and around shoot it back out so for some of you maybe you shouldn't get as right", "start": 652.14, "duration": 15.781}
{"chunk": "as you do but I think if you guys think about getting left maybe sooner that can help at least set things up a", "start": 659.64, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "little bit better yes I really am not a huge fan of the idea of film like I'm staying to the left", "start": 668.76, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "but if I can feel like I really fast right left yeah that's pretty good idea for a lot of", "start": 675.6, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "people most of us that are not quick enough to even make that happen so it's going to time a more like what we want it to be so I guess we", "start": 684.66, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "got to hit some of this thing huh okay let's try it just wanted to say thank you to swing away golf studio for this awesome setup for", "start": 693.6, "duration": 19.579}
{"chunk": "today's videos in my personal experience Milo I've found that hitting full shots is tough it gets a little", "start": 702.959, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "tricky and maybe you shouldn't do that at first because of the board and then we're going to try to spin out from under you and the reason is is because", "start": 714.48, "duration": 19.738}
{"chunk": "pressure again it's not just moving up and down and on a line to and from the target it's also moving", "start": 723.959, "duration": 16.742}
{"chunk": "all over the place it's it's yeah it's kind of messy looking when you actually look at this dresses but left foot's pushing", "start": 732.54, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "this way and this way right foot's pushing this way and spinning that way yeah so this board wants to do that and you're also changing your weight so the", "start": 740.94, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "board if you're really powerful the board will spin yes and I have I'll add a video of me doing this at the driving range so you guys can see with a full", "start": 749.279, "duration": 18.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "eight iron pretty much going all out the board's spun you'll see a face line down the line but I went to", "start": 758.519, "duration": 17.061}
{"chunk": "work but why don't we do some where we maybe take a little speed off so they can see the I'll just do a little flowy one", "start": 766.98, "duration": 16.137999999999998}
{"chunk": "so even there it's spun just a little bit foreign [Music]", "start": 787.019, "duration": 17.481}
{"chunk": "can you do one where you uh you do a little more of a trigger or toss the club out to the Target a little bit so you can see it moving a little bit more", "start": 803.899, "duration": 15.640999999999998}
{"chunk": "so like boom boom so that would be a nice little exercise they can do yeah and even if they didn't", "start": 812.399, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "have the board they could just do it with some heel taps or yeah I have people do it all the time with just heel tap just to get the feel of how to", "start": 821.579, "duration": 16.382}
{"chunk": "yeah get this this heel planted back down while the club is still ascending but the nice thing with this is it kind of forces you to sequence it right or", "start": 829.32, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "else you're going to be hung back and if I do it wrong I want to feel what that would feel like I didn't start down how do people do that you just toss the club at it come", "start": 838.079, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "on [Laughter] you can't do it that was pure all right let me try one give it a whirl I'll be", "start": 847.56, "duration": 16.618000000000002}
{"chunk": "gone push that was a softy down the line", "start": 857.579, "duration": 15.86}
{"chunk": "whoosh whoosh you see that board spin out yeah put too much energy into it carpet's a little slicker than grass my", "start": 877.44, "duration": 16.08}

{"chunk": "board is maybe don't hit balls for like a little bit just do it as an exercise really good for just producing the", "start": 907.139, "duration": 17.762}
{"chunk": "proper flow of pressure from foot to foot so do it at the house and then take it to the range you can maybe hit some little", "start": 916.86, "duration": 16.779}

{"chunk": "just start with some shorter clubs and hit some little low shots and and get the sequence right and then take it out of play", "start": 935.88, "duration": 17.1}
