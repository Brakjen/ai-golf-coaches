{"chunk": "well I see most people are very static at a dress okay so there is no shifting of pressure there is no momentum in the", "start": 40.98, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "golf swing to create some effortless movement yeah so what is that flowing motion from foot to foot what does that have to do with being able to turn well", "start": 49.02, "duration": 19.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "we we kind of teach that there you have to there has to be some pressure shift to create motion you cannot it you you", "start": 58.86, "duration": 15.6}

{"chunk": "creating a little pressure shift so you can resist that momentum and wind or are you just", "start": 110.34, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "kind of lifting the club up and placing it in place yeah exactly because if that's what you're doing most likely what's going to be the next issue we see", "start": 118.38, "duration": 15.3}

{"chunk": "world generally hit it solid well not just solid but they also use some level of pressure shift to start the swing yes", "start": 167.099, "duration": 17.041}

{"chunk": "that you're sliding the pelvis what we're suggesting is is that you have a stance wide enough where your ankles are outside your hips to support a little", "start": 201.18, "duration": 19.62}
{"chunk": "bit of a shift just enough to get the club started to swing I don't want the lifting motion and I don't want this motion and we don't want", "start": 210.48, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "exactly that's a slide so you're really if if your stance is of a width enough where you're trying to be dynamic and you shift your right leg actually", "start": 220.68, "duration": 18.598}
{"chunk": "becomes a break so it starts to send you back to the left and then your left leg is a break and sends you back to the center again", "start": 230.519, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "yes so what we're talking about is a dynamic motion not a static one we're not just sitting in the middle and spinning but we're also not", "start": 238.319, "duration": 18.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "moving swaying in the wind like this we're using a little momentum to create rotation land rotation exactly", "start": 247.64, "duration": 15.878}
{"chunk": "that's how the guys who go fast do it yep and people on my team often hear me say land and turn land and turn yeah", "start": 256.019, "duration": 15.362000000000002}
{"chunk": "both ways exactly it doesn't just happen one way so it goes even from the start it's land and turn land and turn now for", "start": 263.22, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "those who are struggling with this how do we do it in a at a speed in a manner where they can actually begin to learn and feel it and I'm going to let you be", "start": 272.88, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "the example here because they've all watched me hit them and they know I can I can do it okay so we're going to prove that Ed can do it and how how you learn", "start": 282.18, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "well I'm a big advocate of the step drill okay and I think a lot of people have to understand that pressure creates motion first and if we can do this at", "start": 290.12, "duration": 20.559}

{"chunk": "to tell people put the club up forward they shift pressure and as the club is passing them they start pressuring to the other side and then finish over here", "start": 308.759, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "about waist high and I really don't want them to hit it more than 50 50 yards max and so in this situation they're really not using their hands and arms in this", "start": 317.94, "duration": 19.141}
{"chunk": "lever system to generate Force they're just feeling how to pressure pressure and how that gets their body unwinding and winding and unwinding and then also", "start": 327.6, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "the people often take the steps too far so when you're doing the step drill and you're doing it that step is only I", "start": 335.759, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "don't know maybe a foot wide and then the other one's going to be even smaller yeah even smaller so maybe just a couple inches as you're going this way", "start": 344.88, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "because your desire here is to use your pressure shift to create the motion not your hands and arms to hit it this way so now you've explained it let's see you", "start": 353.94, "duration": 16.139}
{"chunk": "do it nice and gentle just like you just like you would teach them to do it okay that was quite nice so there you'll", "start": 362.34, "duration": 18.941}
{"chunk": "see that he landed and his body is going to unwind the system exactly okay perfect anything else we want to add to this no", "start": 372.84, "duration": 18.18}
