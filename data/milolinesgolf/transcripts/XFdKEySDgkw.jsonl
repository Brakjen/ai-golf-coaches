{"chunk": "throw that orange thing under your left the ball of your left foot so I want to try to crush that thing there you go crush it all the way like", "start": 0.0, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "even in the backswing crush it oh I like it the heel came up to it nice all right so we got a great centered pressure shift here uh 77 into", "start": 8.519, "duration": 20.998}
{"chunk": "the trail side there you go you pushed back yeah and I want to see that left leg post up a little easier okay there you go see how much easier it is", "start": 19.92, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "to resist them and pull it twice as hard now and you're not flying yeah good there you go you need time to build", "start": 30.84, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "speed that was good 103. there you go there you go [Music] I never seen you hit one that squarely", "start": 39.239, "duration": 17.733}
{"chunk": "that's three in a row [Laughter] there we go all right", "start": 59.82, "duration": 16.71}
{"chunk": "I'll have a look at that one a little speed on that we're gonna take a look at that one carry 162 what club was that", "start": 67.86, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah getting it down you got it down earlier when we had you on track man you were launching it well into the 20s that's better oh we got a lot of shift not a lot of horizontal Force", "start": 77.1, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "is he getting 93 pressure into your Trailside yeah you do yeah you do you get 93 Trailside um I mean you get back over there fine", "start": 86.4, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "yeah got decent verticals decent torque but no horizontal so that's kind of a mismatch oh I see having no horizontal actually the brakes are pretty good", "start": 95.579, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "brakes are pretty good but the push off yeah let's see where we can get some I mean if you are right side dominant I'm Gonna Leave This pressure shift alone", "start": 103.799, "duration": 16.061000000000003}
{"chunk": "and teach you how to push off that right foot if not we might need to Center up your pressure shift a bit so just leave your Club here hop up on the plate", "start": 112.14, "duration": 18.418}
{"chunk": "all right so look straight ahead put your arms out to the side you're going to close your eyes and turn your arms to the right", "start": 121.079, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "okay good it's pretty centered looks like it well I'm just watching his turn earlier you we're not looking at the captures", "start": 128.819, "duration": 17.021}
{"chunk": "right now actually it goes the hair into his left he almost gets 60 he does get 60 percent so he goes left but he's shifting to the right too far", "start": 144.84, "duration": 16.139}
{"chunk": "yeah so he's shifting to the right too far in his golf swing for sure so we're gonna keep him a little more centered centered or even left he's got a significant mass shift off the ball see", "start": 153.42, "duration": 19.88}
{"chunk": "that throw that uh orange thing under your left the ball of your left foot okay", "start": 163.08, "duration": 15.062000000000001}
{"chunk": "so I want to try to crush that thing there you go crush it all the way like even in the back so I can crush it oh I like it the heel came up to it", "start": 172.26, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "there you go okay good hit hit a couple like that I want to see what happens all right foreign but it was hit", "start": 181.86, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "nice all right let's see what that one did that carried 168 118 ball speed that's good yeah I like that that was up a", "start": 195.78, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "little bit that's definitely up that was good that's perfect so that changed your pressure shift to 76 and on the right where it was 93. that's good everything", "start": 204.239, "duration": 15.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "else looks good look at that vertical is up 95 vertical 195 vertical yeah 195 that's like almost what I get", "start": 212.22, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "that's good timings are good I like it hit a couple more so I still want you to get a big turn behind it but still try", "start": 220.62, "duration": 17.181}
{"chunk": "to keep pressure on that orange thing there you go that looked better that yeah that one didn't look like it was floating forward as he's winding up", "start": 228.78, "duration": 20.601000000000003}
{"chunk": "yeah 83.6 so we're gaining some gas okay that's nice so I'm definitely confident that your", "start": 239.4, "duration": 15.741}
{"chunk": "centered pressure shift is better um but I think there's a lot more gas in there all right missed that one what was the speed on", "start": 251.519, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "that one 84 okay that's good we're up a little bit but we start at 81 80 182 yeah you're gonna move it back a little bit so you're not standing with your", "start": 261.18, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "toes hanging off the edge there you go that's good nice solid okay let's have a look I think vertical is good I think if we just had", "start": 270.0, "duration": 18.738}
{"chunk": "a little more torque that could torque in the hips give us a little more gas we'll show you how to get a little more torque whoa 88 miles per hour", "start": 279.78, "duration": 16.34}
{"chunk": "that's faster that's way faster we're picking up the pace I think if we get some torque and getting posting up through that lead light so let's give", "start": 287.36, "duration": 16.06}
{"chunk": "them that where'd it go the band there you go you're gonna put your Club behind your backside flip it around the other way so I can attach this to the club", "start": 295.68, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "head there you go okay now you're going to wind up like you're making a backswing getting posture like getting golf posture ready", "start": 303.84, "duration": 20.939}
{"chunk": "okay yeah so you got to push so hard you're gonna feel like you're gonna take this foot and push it that direction so that it", "start": 324.539, "duration": 17.082}
{"chunk": "pushes you back there and then see this right here let's look at the let's hold this in here see this number seven right here you gotta turn so hard through it", "start": 340.8, "duration": 15.659}
{"chunk": "that it points back there so you gotta finish there yeah exactly not band wraps around don't let them pull you over", "start": 348.84, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "better still almost but I want you to get right up through it like normal there you go you push back yeah", "start": 357.3, "duration": 16.061}
{"chunk": "you actually made the band stretch well I don't want to see that left leg close up a little easier okay we'll try to get the bend out of that looks like", "start": 369.36, "duration": 18.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "there you go see how much easier it is to resist them I'm pulling twice as hard now and you're not flying yeah", "start": 380.82, "duration": 15.338000000000001}
{"chunk": "good all right now let's see what happens maybe six and a half really that's good when you use your lower body properly", "start": 392.039, "duration": 17.939}
{"chunk": "the speed will come where you don't feel like you're swinging hard oh solid that one looks a little faster yeah the", "start": 409.02, "duration": 15.061}
{"chunk": "ball came off faster yeah nice I like it I mean you know you know what I'm seeing now is as you turn back your left heels coming off the ground a little bit yeah I'm trying to do that and that gives you", "start": 420.12, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "a little more time yeah that's a great speed he can turn back keep his left get his left heel to get off the ground but still feel like he's here pushing through that left toe so you're not", "start": 429.72, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "getting off the ground by just wandering over here dead lift the heel as much as you possibly can while still jamming your left ball your foot into the ground", "start": 437.4, "duration": 16.339}
{"chunk": "on this one small advice yeah my name is faster on that one that's 86 that's that's one of your", "start": 445.139, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "fastest ball speeds yeah 115. I think this is going to be good for driver you might not do it for iron as much but for driver we're going to", "start": 456.539, "duration": 16.262}
{"chunk": "really release that heal nice 86. gotta be that was smart huh I knew", "start": 464.16, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "it 117 ball so that was the fastest 166 carry that's your magic right there yeah wind as big as you can but and let", "start": 473.039, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "the left heel Break Free but still keep pressure under that God it's pretend you're squashing that yellow thing under the ball of your left foot nice", "start": 485.88, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "all right so we got a great centered pressure shift here uh 77 into the trail side awesome verticals not much", "start": 496.88, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "horizontal um I think we're really based on this pressure ship need to work on this torque value getting this up will really help you control the path switch to", "start": 505.44, "duration": 19.739}
{"chunk": "driver switch to driver let's get some gas here all right all the same things foreign", "start": 514.979, "duration": 16.182}
{"chunk": "that one was okay I kind of like it one or two again 250 carry 249 carry yeah see I know the", "start": 528.6, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "numbers there you go tell me a little quick too he's consistent he's hit 102 every swing every time yeah", "start": 537.72, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "let's go 105. sure foreign [Music] how long you wound up that time I think you need more time to create that speed", "start": 550.32, "duration": 18.871}
{"chunk": "so that's what the heel lift is for you need to be like Phil Mickelson and Sam Sneed some of the old-timers who wound up really big", "start": 565.14, "duration": 19.659}
{"chunk": "because you need you don't have enough Mass to create a lot of quick speed yeah yes that was that's the longest one you hit", "start": 579.839, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "two five seven carry yeah I told you it was the longest one my ovals were good well you're getting off the plate I'll move the yeah", "start": 588.98, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "you want to have one foot on each of them not both of them on the left one oh bombs", "start": 597.44, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "High knuckleball okay that's good 80 into the right side I like that pressure shift for you left it's actually really good looking good enough it is what's that", "start": 606.959, "duration": 17.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah yeah well you're getting way to the left yeah I wouldn't worry about that yeah you're good that's nice if there's any little leak of energy it's still that left leg just", "start": 615.86, "duration": 19.58}
{"chunk": "not getting stiff enough straight enough so you can try this one I'll let you be the yeah yeah the band man", "start": 629.04, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "under your foot oh like right under your foot all right so just take a backswing okay and now down swing yeah don't let", "start": 637.32, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "me play there you gotta pull back okay there you go that's what you want to see good so get the heel off the ground", "start": 652.92, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "no snap it back there you go just drop the club maybe just do the arm motion put the club on the ground there you go", "start": 660.6, "duration": 17.137999999999998}
{"chunk": "you're almost feeling like when that toe comes up in the air okay you're trying to rip this carpet off watch out perfect like this toad comes up in the air and", "start": 671.76, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "then you're trying to rip that carpet up that way and they're trying to push it this way oh make that cap go backwards that makes sense shove this carpet that", "start": 679.56, "duration": 16.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "way towards the wall that would make you jump like this yeah so you're pushing you're pushing that way but then push hard enough that", "start": 687.54, "duration": 19.621}
{"chunk": "way that'll shut that hit back here you feel like you're pushing like you're gonna try to jump back into the wall back there look at this like so load like this", "start": 697.2, "duration": 17.021}
{"chunk": "I feel like it yeah there you go you hit 104 we got to get 105 out of it get get that heel off the ground I want you to get a big like reach your hands", "start": 707.76, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "as far as you can back there not up so much but back yeah there you go yeah foreign also you'll see here with your driver", "start": 716.04, "duration": 17.901}
{"chunk": "you do a lot better with the torque there was a little mystery here there's a bump in there but you can see it got to the top of the tour average there so", "start": 726.66, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "um and also a really good um centered pressure shift there so I love the pressure shift um I think if we could just work on that band torque drill or any way to get more", "start": 734.82, "duration": 18.661}
{"chunk": "rotational Force into the ground it would really help you I think we added a few miles an hour but I think more work on that could help get you a little more", "start": 744.3, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "gas in your swing we know what you need you need time to build speed that was good 103. there you go", "start": 753.6, "duration": 15.82}
{"chunk": "that's a good one to walk off on you don't need to keep smashing balls I like it", "start": 766.26, "duration": 9.46}
