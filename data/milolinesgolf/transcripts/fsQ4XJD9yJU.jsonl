{"chunk": "are so basically since then I had a I had an old back injury a disc keration um and as I've gotten into golf and I've started Pro uh playing more practicing", "start": 74.36, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "more I've had a lot of issues with my low back and causing kind of symptoms down the leg so okay I'm hoping to figure out how to swing a golf club without jacking up my back okay so first", "start": 83.68, "duration": 19.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "thing I want to do then is just kind of have you loosen up I'm going to watch for a minute and just see if I can see any movement issues that could be", "start": 93.32, "duration": 15.4}
{"chunk": "aggravating things cool there's some issues there grab me something with a little less Loft okay", "start": 100.32, "duration": 18.562}

{"chunk": "minute let's take a look let's just start with some setup stuff okay as I look at your setup here some of it I", "start": 138.76, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "like okay some of it I don't love a lot it's like your handle's almost a little too low okay your feet are ducked out too much so your left foot is really", "start": 147.2, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "like open on a 45 almost and your grip is on the weakish side when we look at left hand grip maybe just slightly weak", "start": 156.08, "duration": 15.319}
{"chunk": "the right hand's good now we're going to get into the movement pattern side of thing so how do you wind up what's", "start": 164.48, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "creating the swing for you and what I see is a ton of early arm action so", "start": 171.28, "duration": 15.718}
{"chunk": "you're loading your arms very early in the back swing okay okay you're not using momentum in the big muscles to", "start": 179.159, "duration": 15.802}
{"chunk": "wind you're creating the wind early in the arms so if you use your arms really early in the back swing you're going to use them really early and hard in the", "start": 187.56, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "downswing now that's why you look all bunched up right here y okay the other thing we wind up with is your lower half", "start": 196.64, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "winds up way out from where it starts so if I put your rear end on a wall here and we wind you up you can see you really don't turn very much in the back", "start": 204.72, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "swing now see how far everything is shooting out into the golf ball yeah that's pain Central there when you start seeing the pelvis doing that your belt", "start": 214.36, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "line is all the way level there's something's got to bend down there yeah so you're you're bending more than you ought to from the back not enough from the pelvis does that make sense", "start": 222.76, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "absolutely okay then we look at over here from the face on Viewpoint and we see how as you're loading your pelvis is", "start": 232.0, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "not winding around behind you it's like this kind of a action so if I'm if I wind like this what have I already", "start": 239.959, "duration": 17.801}
{"chunk": "done I've already kind of loaded up this glute this hamstring I'm I'm kind of I'm ready to go right yep what's going to", "start": 249.879, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "happen next this way yeah there's no room to continue the loading yeah we don't really want to be Max loaded at", "start": 256.88, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "the top of the back swing necessarily we want to be Max loaded right here at the end of the transition does that make sense yeah I'm like squatted and loaded", "start": 265.44, "duration": 18.76}
{"chunk": "here so I'm GNA go I'm not I'm not going to go more back if I'm already back yeah the odds are slim yeah okay no that makes sense so you're not going to do it", "start": 274.8, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "so you don't and you actually deliver the golf club really good for what you do normally when I see his pattern that wouldn't look like that at", "start": 283.6, "duration": 16.999}
{"chunk": "impact it's pretty decent so there's a lot of good I want to work on how you're winding up I want to see you feel like there's some movement so now I can go", "start": 291.919, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "trigger a little left right my center of masses are going to both feel like they're going up so I'm going to feel like I'm rising and winding and as I do", "start": 300.639, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "that see how my pelvis kind of turns around behind me yep and then the last thing that gets loaded is my arms and", "start": 309.0, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "that happens as my body starts to fall does that make sense so yeah the arms your arms are loaded by here yeah", "start": 316.32, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "boom going to hit I want you to feel a little trigger one see how my arms really haven't moved relative to my Center wind wind wind", "start": 325.4, "duration": 16.599}
{"chunk": "wind wind now they're loaded in that transition phase okay that's what we're going to figure out how to do for you like I feel like when I started learning", "start": 334.199, "duration": 17.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "golf it my feel was like I just like lock all this stuff so I can feel that I'm like creating that tension and then uh and then I'm just like turning from", "start": 342.52, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "there so I'm like taking the fluidity out of the movement and maybe like At first that helped me like start to hit the you know hit the actual Ball but I had tendency to do that even when I like", "start": 351.919, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "throw is I just muscle everything and I lock it down and just try to like force it through which way is the hand going as the body is going it's going back so", "start": 360.759, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "they're they're going away from each other but that's what I mean is I like if you looked at even though I could throw well I got away with it CU I was", "start": 369.199, "duration": 16.482}
{"chunk": "strong but it wasn't efficient and I had issues because I wasn't separating I would just like my throat not to take us down that path but my throwing motion", "start": 377.36, "duration": 15.559000000000001}
{"chunk": "was like I just get cocked and then I just take my lat and I just go and I just rip it forward like that so it could come out but it was like it's not", "start": 385.199, "duration": 16.76}
{"chunk": "it's not good there's there's a reason I'm not playing baseball okay so so I think for me feeling the fluidity and not like moving without tension is going", "start": 393.72, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "to be hard but I can see like for sure how and why that's what's going to save your body though yeah what about your pelvis I mean just watching did you see", "start": 402.12, "duration": 16.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "some things that could be causing oh 100% yeah I mean I'm doing a a quadrant test for low back pain and I can feel it especially like as I get more more", "start": 411.08, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "warmed up and I try to swing harder and harder what I feel is like I go I get like really tight and then I have a tendency to go boom and I just like", "start": 419.759, "duration": 19.001}
{"chunk": "swing across to the left and then I think because I kind of feel that I'm doing that I'm like oh shoot I better do this together yeah and then I can feel", "start": 429.28, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "that like if I do that that's not a comfortable thing for my back for sure definitely not a good thing for and I'm doing it over and over and over so since my surgery I've been able to start to", "start": 437.479, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "feel when I take a swing cuz the the part of the issue is like my back doesn't really hurt when I I play it'll be a couple days later or like I said I don't get too much back pain I'll get", "start": 445.44, "duration": 15.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "the nerve pain and that's what I'm like oh man I I screwed up yeah so no that makes sense of what you're saying and for sure with the pelvis like it's not I", "start": 453.56, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "mean it's not doing anything other than just I'm I'm squatting so I'm going to go from here yeah so that's where I want", "start": 461.199, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "to attack this so now it's how do we develop those patterns so we can change them okay and so let's let's start with some some little drills okay I'm going", "start": 468.72, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "to have you put on a tea okay we're going to start with just some without the ball probably for the first little bit here and I just want you to kind of", "start": 477.8, "duration": 16.921000000000003}
