{"chunk": "and I did on converting your baseball swing to a golf swing the two segments you'll see here will focus on the hands and wrists which I believe are the", "start": 65.88, "duration": 18.36}

{"chunk": "Golf just like I did there are some some big differences we see right but for the most part A lot of the body movement", "start": 84.479, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "very similar yeah I would say there's more similarities in what our body does but the mechanics of how the hands work is where we're really going to find yes", "start": 92.96, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "differences in the two swings okay so let's get into it our first key our first essential to making this transition is the grip okay so our only", "start": 101.52, "duration": 21.0}
{"chunk": "connection between our hands and the bat or the golf club yes okay so talk us through I you're the Batman today I'm", "start": 111.2, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "the Batman since I actually once played this fairly well you were a good baseball player so talk us through the grip so when a a baseball player holds a", "start": 120.0, "duration": 17.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "bat they hold it not quite as much in the fingers as a golfer does a baseball player holds it a little bit more through this part of their hand", "start": 128.319, "duration": 17.958999999999996}
{"chunk": "very similar the grip's tapered here at the bottom MH one thing that's different is when you hold a baseball bat you hold it pretty much straight through your", "start": 137.959, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "hand this way there's no angle it's just straight through and then the other hand goes on where it's kind of in the right at the the base of your fingers and it", "start": 145.599, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "wraps around and if you look at my Knuckles they're somewhat lined up so you've got these Knuckles here and then the knuckles on my right hand split the", "start": 155.599, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "middle of those Knuckles when I hit a baseball I hit it with left palm down right palm up okay", "start": 163.36, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "so they're kind of they're matching they're more or less matching but do we always see that in golf not really well there's a reason that they don't match", "start": 173.08, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "in golf and we'll get into that in just a minute but so the baseball swing we're we're trying to hit it with our wrists in their most stable position so it's", "start": 181.4, "duration": 17.24}
{"chunk": "basically like that where yeah flat wrist more or less maybe slightly extended flat wrist maybe slightly extended but that is very stable there's", "start": 189.2, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "a reason the balls coming fairly fast yeah it puts pretty good wall up on that bat especially when you m hit it hit it in the end of the batter or in the handle and it it rings pretty good", "start": 199.599, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "tingle yes so let let me turn this to the camera real quick so you can see too that I think my hands take up a", "start": 209.439, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "little more distance on this golf club than you do on the bat my thumbs are around the bat yeah I don't have my thumbs this way and I don't have it see if I diagonal my hand where the bat ran", "start": 217.56, "duration": 19.639}
{"chunk": "through my fingers like a golf club mhm I would take up that entire grip pretty much with my hand this way I don't baseball players going to know they're", "start": 226.959, "duration": 18.441}
{"chunk": "going to understand those alignments but how are they going to trans I it to golf right so the one thing you mentioned already was sort of the diagonal yeah", "start": 236.2, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "the club runs slightly diagonally through your fingers and it's more toward your fingers than the Palm where in baseball little more like that if I", "start": 245.4, "duration": 16.64}

{"chunk": "just go to address how strong is your grip like way strong upside down right yeah that's how baseball players are supposed to grip it", "start": 305.84, "duration": 18.521}
{"chunk": "so the conditions though of the wrist are fair Fairly similar on the left yep we're going to get into the the right wrist but but I mean the left hand grip", "start": 315.12, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "for you baseball players at home it's not a huge change it's just a little bit more in the fingers and then the thumb we like to see a little bit more", "start": 324.52, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "extended obviously it's not going to be wrapped around we see that sometimes we do yes so the thumb's going to be just resting kind of diagonally on the club", "start": 332.199, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "the pad of the thumb sits on the the side of the golf club slightly yep yep something like that let's talk about the right hand now so right hand similarly", "start": 341.28, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "to the the left hand where you have the the the grip of the baseball bat more in the Palm sort of you kind of have that with the right hand too right more in", "start": 350.68, "duration": 17.76}

{"chunk": "contact with my right hand under I need my right hand to this is where they really differentiate yes round bat not a round bat over there it's got a face on", "start": 369.319, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "it yes in order for me to be able to manage that face thing my right hand's going to go on a little different with a", "start": 378.52, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "golf club mhm so more in the fingers again right it's going to be more in the fingers sort of on a diagonal slightly diagonal through the hand more in the", "start": 386.56, "duration": 17.239000000000004}
{"chunk": "fingers and the palm of the hand more less matching this face yes and you got to cover that thumb whereas before the thumb and baseballs under your right", "start": 395.44, "duration": 19.561}
{"chunk": "hand the the biggest difference it's really in the right hand right in the fingers and how it's in the fingers and the thumbs the thumbs aren't wrapped", "start": 405.28, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "around yes the thumbs are supporting in golf they're a little different okay so Trail wrist mechanic a baseball player Trail wrists works completely radial", "start": 413.599, "duration": 23.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "Ander they don't have extension mhm so radial which can't really do a ton of yeah very little and thenner yes", "start": 424.039, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "extension being this way so there's not as much of this in baseball very little of this in baseball and very little of", "start": 434.12, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "this in the trail wrist in baseball right it's working like a hammer so when you swing a hammer boom yep boom so at", "start": 442.68, "duration": 18.039}

{"chunk": "when it releases the energy will release the energy this way going toward an ner", "start": 460.28, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "deviation so it's like that into impact where a golf swing is going to be slightly different than that because we've got to get that face Square so", "start": 467.36, "duration": 18.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "where golfers or baseball players go wrong when they're playing golf is that they try to hit that ball with that same wrist condition where if I have a face", "start": 477.36, "duration": 18.441}
{"chunk": "and I swing this down and I go this way with my wrist you can see that face is fairly open it's like hitting flu shots yeah and so they slice slice slice the", "start": 486.96, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "mistake they generally make is once they start slicing then they start trying to square the face a whole new way so they start throwing the club head out or they", "start": 495.199, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "turn it at setup or they turn it at setup and cheat and it's all because their wrist mechanics are bad so it's not under and then radial owner we have", "start": 504.08, "duration": 17.559}
{"chunk": "to get that right hand on the side so it matches the face and it's mostly extension flexion this way yeah like throwing so it's like a blend of hitting", "start": 512.599, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "and throwing probably why pitchers are pretty good golfers a lot of pitch yeah what a pitcher does in baseball is spin a ball right so they can create", "start": 521.919, "duration": 16.321}
