{"chunk": "worry about that right now the thing that I'm I will say is that my arms are swinging because my chest is turning so", "start": 55.519, "duration": 16.291}
{"chunk": "my chest actually drives my left arm forward okay now there's a lot of power in that my chest will drive my left arm", "start": 62.96, "duration": 18.15}

{"chunk": "hitting a baseball now my right arm it positions itself on the back of the bat so as my chest turns my left arm my right arm gets on the back of the bat", "start": 80.03, "duration": 18.019}
