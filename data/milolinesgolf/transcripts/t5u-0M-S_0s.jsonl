{"chunk": "all right back out here at superstition mountain milo lines henry fall and today we're going to talk about a few different takeaways we've seen", "start": 0.16, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "throughout the history of golf the handle drag the early hinge and then the one piece takeaway many of you have probably heard", "start": 7.759, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "of these takeaways before sure so henry let's let's get into what each of these are and who we've just some famous players", "start": 15.12, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "that demonstrate each of the the varieties so your first one you mentioned was the handle drag so when you say handle drag what do you mean by", "start": 29.439, "duration": 16.241999999999997}
{"chunk": "the handy handle drag takeaway you mean the handle is moving a little bit ahead of the head yeah okay so who would who would be some people", "start": 37.68, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "who show that well to me i would say ben hogan or jason dufner for sure yeah um and it's funny because it can't handle", "start": 44.8, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "drag but in a way it's almost a handle push because that's that's the first thing moving what's actually creating that is it a push or is it a pivot of the body that's", "start": 53.6, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "dragging right that's the question so when you look at hogan especially the first thing that's really going isn't necessarily his hands and arms is", "start": 62.879, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "actually his body's starting to pivot first and in almost everybody i've i saw you know we've got gears nowadays you can measure this", "start": 71.84, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "every single tour player who's really good that i've looked at as they move the club off the ball whether they be the handle drag type or", "start": 80.4, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "the one piece or the hands their chest is moving faster than their left arm is so they're not moving this across their chest early so it's starting in here first for all of them", "start": 88.32, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "doesn't matter which one of these methods they're using for all of them it's starting from in here okay okay so who comes to mind for a one-piece takeaway well the old-school jack", "start": 97.92, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "nicholas that would be kind of you know he seemed like kept it in one piece and just moved it away and when we say one piece it's kind of like if i have this y right here the", "start": 106.24, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "y is kind of moving together the whole y moves as one big unit he doesn't really get any hinge in his wrists early you know his wrist really didn't start setting until", "start": 115.36, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "the club was above shaft parallel yeah i also think of like a young tiger he was very i would say wide and young tiger was definitely that that", "start": 123.6, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "model yeah and the last one would be sort of a early set or an early hinge putting that trail wrist that we talked about so often into extension so who are", "start": 133.2, "duration": 18.877999999999997}
{"chunk": "some guys that maybe come to mind in today's game i'd say dustin johnson you know his first move is the handle actually goes kind of up and forward and he hinges his wrist yeah", "start": 142.879, "duration": 18.720999999999997}
{"chunk": "so he starts setting this angle but then if you actually look at it see his arm goes away from his body and then his body turns so", "start": 151.68, "duration": 15.041000000000002}
{"chunk": "that's kind of yeah no matter which one it is the body's turning so that the power the the energy is coming from here", "start": 159.76, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "not from the hands so i don't no matter which one of these it is i would say another one maybe mac o'grady for your mac oh grady enthusiasts out there but", "start": 167.519, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "oh yeah max mac was an earlier hinger i'm a little earlier hinger so i'm just naturally i'm kind of handsy so", "start": 175.84, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "for me it feels good but again i go back and i look at the movement patterns and it still starts from here even though my hands are starting to hinge pretty fast okay so if", "start": 184.159, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "you're telling us that there's that that pivot that sort of everything's starting from the core even in take away where it may look like or appear like it's more hands and arm", "start": 192.48, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah so there's for almost everybody if we put some force plates under their feet you'd see a little spike under the front foot and then a wind up of the body whether the", "start": 201.04, "duration": 16.558}
{"chunk": "player is what we would we coined the dragger they started like this or a one-piece takeaway guy", "start": 209.519, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "or a little bit of a hands early take away none of them throw it out of the top the energy does not go into the golf club", "start": 217.599, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "from the hands first and we don't get the center mass of that golf club tumbling out over the top of our hands i don't care who they are or what they", "start": 226.56, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "said they felt they did they didn't do that just because hogan and dufner start like this doesn't mean they're going to return like that well they better not if they did they", "start": 234.959, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "wouldn't be hogan or duffner yeah the energy came from their middle and moved out into the golf club that's how they were able to be dynamic because", "start": 244.319, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "otherwise it wouldn't have been dynamic right so i guess the key we're trying to communicate here too is that whether you take away", "start": 253.519, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "whatever way you take it away it doesn't necessarily matter it's really in transition you're seeing the similar movements from these top players and the", "start": 261.519, "duration": 15.362}
{"chunk": "best players they have great flow in their sequence yeah and everything moves from inside out so if at home you're feeling like man i", "start": 269.12, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "like this feel of kind of getting the club moving off the ball first the the grip end because that kind of creates that flow that you so often speak of and", "start": 278.56, "duration": 20.519}
{"chunk": "i'm really driving this takeaway with my pivot that can maybe be a good feeling for you and maybe lines up with what your swing ought to be and for players who", "start": 288.639, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "tend to be casters i i sometimes i'll have them do that just to get the feeling of having some softness and not throwing that out of the top so it's kind of like that yeah like", "start": 298.16, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "for sure now whereas you and i are a little bit more setting it a little bit earlier and once it's set or we're actually increasing that set", "start": 306.16, "duration": 18.319999999999997}
{"chunk": "yeah then we still pivot the same way but um it's not maybe set as late as that other maybe not as later as deep so the guys", "start": 315.36, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "who are wider and set it like that can sometimes they can even get a deeper set you know long drivers tend to be on that end of", "start": 323.919, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "things i tend to be more of a golfer than a long driver so my goal is to hit it straight yep so you know", "start": 332.4, "duration": 16.64}
