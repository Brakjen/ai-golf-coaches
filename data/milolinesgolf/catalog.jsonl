Basically, it just doesn't stick, and those all-out air swings could only be making your swing and ball striking worse.

You would always open your chest when throwing a ball, swinging a bat, or delivering a forehand in tennis – so why not in the golf swing?\n\nThe best in the world are getting their chest open at impact, turning freely in their bends, so now let's show you how you can too...

Many believe it will cause you to only get steep and come over-the-top. But I'm here to tell you that doesn't have to be the case! In fact, rotation done correctly can lead to more speed and power, better contact, more compression, and (perhaps best of all) freedom in your golf swing. Wouldn't you prefer own a more effortless golf swing! Legends like Ben Hogan, Lee Trevino, and Sam Snead didn't hold back and resist rotation, so why should you?\n\nYou'll also see in this 1st KEY that rotation doesn't start where you think. It seems everyone talks about hip rotation, but as you'll find out I believe the focus should be somewhere else...\n\nDon't forget to watch the complete 5 KEYS to Rotation, as it's critical you understand the matchups you need to get more open at impact, and turn the right way! I call these my \"non-negotiables\". Henry and I will also share a few simple rotation drills you can put into practice right away. And in this video series you'll learn how a rotational golf swing could be the answer you've been looking for, to finally improve your ball striking and find more consistency in your game.

That's the question I'll look to answer in this test...\n***Learn The Athlete's Swing™ HERE*** http://swinglikeanathlete.com\n\nIt's been often said that upwards of 80% or 90% of our clubhead speed comes from the hands and arms in the golf swing, but I've often seen it differently. That's not to say everyone is exactly the same. The argument has also long been to look at a golfer swinging from their knees as proof (a la Tiger Woods who I showcase in this video) because upwards of 80% clubhead speed can still be created this way. However, are the hands and arms truly exclusive in this exercise? Perhaps a higher % should be accounted for from other areas, such as the chest, ribcage, torso, and even a % from the pelvis, feet, and legs? Especially when standing...\n\nLastly, maybe the golf swing shouldn't always be boiled down into singular parts, but rather looked at, and thought of more systematically. I believe in creating a more athletic, global movement pattern for this reason, learning to wind up the system and unwind for best performance...

For a more natural, athletic, and effortless move, here's my 2 cents... *Get swing analysis every 2 weeks + Milo’s full swing playbook HERE 👉 https://swinglikeanathlete.com*\n\n...in my opinion the arms should not be thought of as the power producer. To me it is a passive powering of the arms by the whole system (or body) that creates a true organic, athletic swing. Like we see in other sports, the hands and arms are not the sole producers of speed. They are more loose and springy, being stretched out for maximal speed. They are as I like to say, energized.\n\nIn this video I'll walk you through how I like to see the arms managed (especially in transition) and how I teach my students. For many I work with, tension in the arms, and over-activation of the arms robs them of so much speed and power. Flow also goes out the window. The swing becomes completely unnatural, stiff, and jerky. But with the right roadmap and understanding of athletic movement and sequence in general, I truly believe anyone can find a more natural move. And finally Swing Like an Athlete!

As you'll see here with Casey, who mind you is still very new to golf, he was able to make quick improvements.

He liked to talk about his swing as feeling \"oily\" and it shows. Can you think of a smoother looking action? And when we look at his swing and listen to his feels, it becomes clear how important footwork was for him...even going as far to actually play golf barefoot or in his socks.\n\nIn this video you'll see the lower body feel and drill Sam Snead used for his elite ball striking. This gave him great balance, weight shift, sequence, and all but eliminated any move towards early extension. Thank you for watching and I hope you enjoy this look back at a legend and the key feel he used in his swing...one I feel as well! Don't tell your local pro it was me who told you to practice barefoot.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\nhttps://youtube.com/@MiloLinesGolf\n\nONLINE ACADEMY\nhttps://milolinesgolf.com/online-academy/\n\nBOOK A LESSON\nhttps://milolinesgolf.com/schedule-lesson/\n\nGOLF SCHOOLS\nhttps://milolinesgolf.com/golf-schools/\n\nMILO APPROVED TRAINING GEAR + DISCOUNTS\nhttps://milolinesgolf.com/training-gear/\n\nWATCH THESE NEXT\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjV_r3ZQM48\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0t3kQ24Ci4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvLiJI1Ep38\n\nFOLLOW MILO\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/milolines_golf/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/milolinesgolf\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MiloLinesGolf\n\nDon’t forget to LEAVE A COMMENT with any and all questions, video tip requests, and thoughts.

Casting in the downswing is no good, plain and simple. Those who command good ball striking (like Sam Snead and Patrick Cantlay as you'll see) are not throwing angles from the top, but rather conserving them (more or less) into the ball. This produces the compressed impact we all seek after, with some amount of shaft lean.\n\nThe same could be said for hitters in baseball or if you were to chop a tree. Angles are not thrown out with an early release but rather preserved, then let out more naturally later in the motion. And as you'll see in this episode, you'll learn to quit the cast and pass, and begin to load and tow!

Aligning and moving the left elbow like this was a game-changer.\n\n*Get swing analysis every 2 weeks + Milo's full swing playbook HERE 👉 https://swinglikeanathlete.com*\n\nI was very fortunate starting out in this game to have such a strong, impactful voice in my Dad. He gave me great fundamentals for my golf swing that correlated with my baseball roots. One of those key, I would consider, \"magic\" matchups was the left arm (or lead arm) and how the left hand grip, left elbow, arms and shoulder all aligned. I believe this created a sort of power line.\n\nThis position at the onset allowed me to swing just like I would in baseball, or when throwing a frisbee, or making similar athletic movements. While many instructions in the past (including Ben Hogan and his 5 lessons book) may have eluded to a more externally rotated lead arm at setup, video and photos of Mr. Hogan, and many other greats tend to show a more internally rotated lead arm as I point out in this video. To me this is a much more powerful structure and alignment, aligning with other sports, and allows you to truly swing and spring the lead arm versus forcing it. This also aligns with my general opposition of lowering and pulling down the arms to start the downswing, a move I generally see ruin a natural swing and arc.\n\nI hope you enjoy this episode!

Here's what I learned.\n\n*Get swing analysis every 2 weeks + Milo’s full swing playbook HERE 👉 https://swinglikeanathlete.com*\n\nHow we release the golf club is a hot topic, but not only that, it's important to discuss when we release. I've long been of the belief that the release in general should feel rather passive and that it should happen as more of a byproduct, with physics ultimately taking command. It is after all nearly impossible to truly hold wrist angles forever, especially at maximum speed.\n\nIn this episode I share with you my experiment using Trackman to determine which \"release\" style is most effective in producing the maximum speed for me. How you interpret my findings are ultimately up to you, but for me there was one apparent winner.

As part of this switch, I found myself fascinated by the great ball strikers of the past and present, and what they did so well. One person stood out to me and that was David Duval. I had the chance to watch him in person when he came to Phoenix that year and I was mesmerized by his game.\n\nIt was then I decided to further analyze David's golf swing and started to notice aspects of his action that paralleled my baseball swing. I picked up on his strong left land grip, his rotational move, the stable club face, and how his eyes and head followed the ball. These patterns were familiar to me, and for that reason I began using David as my sort of model.

She left hitting higher, straighter irons!\n***Access My FREE 5 Keys to Rotation*** https://milolinesgolf.com/5-keys-to-unlocking-a-rotational-golf-swing/*\n\nIn this lesson, it was quickly evident that Becca's bowed left wrist was causing her face to get overly closed and de-lofted, leading to a low left miss with her irons. By neutralizing her wrist hinge and stabilizing the club face, she quickly was able to start hitting her irons higher again, with more spin, and with far less shots pulling to the left. \n\nWhile some players like a Collin Morikawa or Dustin Johnson may be able to make that pattern work, it's important to consider the student and ball flight characteristics, such as: height, spin, launch angle, land angle, start line, and curve. How they manage the club face and release is crucial in being able to match up their bow in the lead wrist.

The strike is most often not compressed and the swing lacks the movements required to produce consistent ball striking, especially when hitting irons.

And we label this iron shot as essential as we see the best players throughout history demonstrating this shot on a regular basis. Look no further than Jordan Spieth, Tommy Fleetwood, Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, or Wyndham Clark for evidence of this crucial shot. And once mastered, you'll stop flipping at impact for sure!\n\nWe hope you enjoy this video and do encourage you to add this simple shot to your next practice session to springboard your ball striking.

While Remec already had a very nice action, he was a little hindered in how much he could increase swing speed, take the governor off, and freely turn without losing control (especially with a driver). This forced him to slow down to keep the ball in play so he could still shoot a score.

  {"video_id": "mkuvnoPqmeY", "title": "DON'T Keep Your Back To The Target In The Downswing!", "description": "Many golfers have been told to \"keep your back to the target in the downswing\", but is that the most optimal matchup? The feeling has certainly worked for many high level players, as demonstrated in this video by Justin Rose. That said, in my experience, professionals have a far superior pivot to begin with and what they \"feel\" isn't necessarily \"real\" in their swing. Depending on where they are in their golf swing journey, that feel could match up well for them. After all, elite golfers are typically just looking to find neutral to some extent. It's not my preference to see them keep their back to the target longer, but that matchup can and has worked for some. However, in my experience I don't believe it's the feel the majority of the golfing population should strive for, as there are numerous other factors that play into creating the over the top golf swing often associated with this potential solution. The question I pose to you in this video is, is there another way, and perhaps could another way be more functional and dynamic?

In this video, Giulia and Milo will share insights on her LPGA golf swing and what adjustments may need to be made for women and girls looking to improve their actions, and wondering how to increase club head speed. If you regularly watch our content, you'll note that many of the golf lessons provided here will in fact sound familiar (such as the lesson on the left arm in golf swing) with a few subtle modifications. Interestingly as well, women tend to produce higher degrees of hip rotation in the golf swing. The women's golf swing laid out here can in fact also help most male golfers, and seems to especially align with traits we see in the senior golf swing with a bit more of a golf release at impact.

This gets the hands really deep and typically correlates with a lack of wind-up and body turn in the backswing. From here, we often see the hand path shoot out to start the downswing and create an over-the-top pattern. \n\nWe'll show you a better way to takeaway the golf club, wide and with a \"straight\" left arm. However, straight is another word we need be careful with. A straight left arm can cause people to get too tense and rigid, depriving them of potential swing speed and the dynamic sling you often hear us discuss on this channel. \n\nWe'll show you the proper way to propel the arms in the golf swing without getting locked up.

(Part 2 LIVE)", "description": "To conclude our two part lesson with Spencer, Henry and I further build on our first day's lesson by continuing to encourage a more dynamic athletic move. In this golf lesson, we focus more on the golf wrist hinge and how creating right wrist extension (to be released into wrist flexion) can be utilized for more power and a more stable club face angle throughout. For Spencer, the tendency was to get his right hand grip on the club too strong, causing him to tilt more coming into impact and resulting in low point control issues with his irons and wedges. Correcting his right hand grip, as was also seen in the first golf lesson was a key part in helping Spencer improve his ball striking. With this method, you will see far less roll of the club face, therefore producing a much more square golf swing release. With this wrist action established, Spencer could then turn on the jets and begin letting his more athletic swing loose!

This move which happens along with the pressure shift back to the lead side helps us stack up our centers (upper and lower), the torso and pelvis, so we can then turn into the ball with proper low point control, angle of attack, and path. Without this landing phase, turning or rotating only spins us out and can create a steep downswing. In addition to the rib sway early in the downswing, we'll also look at the rib sway early in the backswing and takeaway which helps create a proper wind up off the ball.

Let's fix that!\n\nShift like a pro! *Get your DownShift Board for 10% OFF: https://milolinesgolf.com/training-gear/*\n\nIn this video, Henry and I whip out the Downshift pressure board to demonstrate this important move to change directions athletically from your backswing to downswing. One of the main issues we find is that amateur golfers tend to move too far right in their backswing and struggle to get back to their lead side, as seen in our recent golf school with Dr. Scott Lynn and Swing Catalyst. \n\nThis often results in a steep downswing, tilting, sliding, chunks, thins, etc. There also seems to be a misunderstanding between mass, weight and pressure. We will clear up the confusion between weight shift or weight transfer, and our preferred pressure shift move. And rather than just keeping weight on left side in golf swing, with help from the Downshift board, you will learn the key transition moves needed to sequence and transfer energy more efficiently in your golf swing!

This resulted in a more optimal push draw shape and far more distance! In just 30 minutes with the help of this right hand back to compress feel, he increased carry with his 7 iron from 154 yards to 175 yards...a 21 yard increase!\n\nIf you have long been following the Milo Lines Golf channel, you'll know one of the staples of my preferred rotational golf swing method is the trail or right hand and wrist position, and how right wrist hinge (wrist extension) can create a more powerful, stable motion. In this lesson you will see how that movement brought about a more dynamic pattern for Jeremy. He went from swipey weak push fades and pulls to strong push draws.

By standing the club up in the backswing with good wrist conditions and working into lead side bend, we can then bounce into the downswing with less effort with the club staying up and back for a more in to out club path.

In this video, I'd like to share my understanding of this movement and why I have the preferences I do. There are undoubtedly endless ways to move, match up, and swing the golf club, but if you have followed my channel you will know I like to move in a baseball hitting-like pattern, with rotation and flexion, a pattern I tend to see in the most powerful players. In this video I also incorporate some findings of Dr. Mark Bull @bull3dgolfacademy56 which I believe further demonstrate my preference that the arms do not fire down (and lower independently) from the top, but rather work slightly into us as we begin to unwind and flex leaving the club up and back. This produces a later firing of the arms and the club into the ball. As in most anything in life, there are various beliefs, interpretations of data, and how people convey their findings. I will continue to share my preferences with you here, preferences that I believe the most dynamic ball strikers embody in their golf swings.

(Shaft 90 Degrees To Your Spine)", "description": "Let's look at a matchup I see amongst many of the great ball strikers throughout history, the shaft 90 degrees to the spine in the downswing. Fellow Milo Lines Golf coach, Ed Lasater joins me to show you this awesome matchup! This simple concept can help us in shallowing the golf club and in turn delivering the club through more of a rotational golf swing. This move can be natural if you allow the center of mass to kick back in transition. For many this never happens because they pull down, throw, and drop their arms from the top. We also look at the swings of Jon Rahm and Matthew Wolff to show how different backswing patterns can still produce a similar look in the downswing. Stop adding the energy early and learn to land and turn as shown in the video to get the club following you from behind into the ball.

Henry and I will walk you through this simple concept to help you naturally slot the club. For many of you, the club gets behind early because of poor wrist conditions and little to no left side bend. This makes the club heavy early and often results in an over the top downswing. Conversely, we'll show you the opposite pattern, one where we make the shaft more vertical in the golf swing takeaway and backswing and make the golf club light. From there, much like tipping a baseball bat and the barrel falling back (shallowing), the club can fall into the slot with much less effort in transition coupled with your unwind.

Have you been told that early rotation will only make you steep? There are undoubtedly numerous ways and methods on how to shallow the club in transition, but I've lately seen many fellow coaches say that rotation is strictly producing a steep golf swing and causing golfers to spin over the top. They say the answer is to keep your back turned to the target and lower the arms to start the downswing. While I agree a certain type of rotation can create havoc and act as a swing steepener, this is not how I turn! And my preferences on shallowing the golf club in fact include rotation. I'll break down these different opinions and matchups, then with the help of Gears Sports 3D data, offer video breakdown of the transition movements captured from the swings of Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia, and myself. And wouldn't you guess, we all do a same key move in transition that allows us to turn and unwind freely in our downswings, uninhibited, and with no over the top pattern.

For those of you that hit it too high and lose distance because of too much loft and low clubhead speed at impact, you'll learn how to deloft irons, reduce your dynamic loft, and have the golf ball exit out instead of up. Not only will your launch angle, contact, and dispersion improve, but you will hit it farther as well. Maybe you have long wondered how the pros make it look so effortless, yet hit it so far?

We focused firstly on adjusting his grip from a very weak grip to a more neutral grip, even strong golf grip. From there we worked hard on getting him to stand the club up towards the top of the backswing with a much bigger turn so he could have it shallow versus the club getting laid off and him using a tumble move to start the downswing. We also made use of The Hanger golf aid, a golf training aid I like to utilize from time-to-time to help with wrist conditions and club face alignment.

We kick off 2023 by returning to my roots, baseball! In this video, Henry and I uncover how you can better master the hitting zone, by looking at how elite hitters (both in golf and baseball) energize the delivery, and get the golf club or barrel to shallow as they turn through for a more dynamic impact position and swing path. As in golf, there are different philosophies on the baseball swing. From afar, there appears to be two primary approaches, one with a more straight line approach, and two where the bat lays down first behind the hitter. In this video, like always, I'll uncover my preferences and we'll look at legendary hitters like Aaron Judge, Ted Williams, Alex Rodriguez, and Albert Pujols for inspiration. Please note that I don't pretend or claim to be a baseball hitting coach, but I see similar athletic movements in both sports and believe the swings are more alike than not.

In the golf swing transition, I like to see the lead arm move in towards the chest slightly more. This change in direction causes the center of mass or club head to then stay back. From here we can rotate back into the ball without coming over the top. Most great players, for example in the Dustin Johnson golf swing have this subtle move in their swing, and I even look at one of the competitors in the recent USGA Adaptive Open as he was an inspiration for this video.

Some take it inside and get it back on plane, some swing more up and down a single plane, and others take it outside and shallow it out more in the downswing. All have worked for the greats throughout history and we reference the swings of Sam Snead, Sergio Garcia and Bubba Watson to compare and contrast. We also take a look at our swings side-by-side, even hitting side-by-side to take a look at our different unique matchups where Henry has more of a single plane golf swing, where mine tracks more as a two plane.

In his case, creating a stable impact with a weak grip was challenging with the amount of bow in left wrist he was needing to produce shaft lean. This led to heel strikes, a few shanks, and high pulls with his wedges. After some coaxing, Henry and I were able to have Cortland experiment with a strong golf grip, specifically in the left hand. This immediately brought about a more stable, square club face and allowed us to then focus on better movement and creating more optimal dynamics for his swing.

Too much weight transfer in the golf swing can cause low point control issues and leads to excessive sliding and tilting. With proper stance and pressure shifts one can make best use of ground force reaction. It's important to also understand the difference between weight and pressure shifts and in this video, Henry and I will do just that.

In this case, we incorporate a classic golf exercise known as the lawnmower drill with a little twist. This movement can help you feel how to pressure the ground not just in a linear fashion, but also down, towards, and away from the golf ball to help set up that rotational spiral action!

It provides wonderful (immediate) feedback, most notably through the hitting area and impact when we are looking to have some shaft lean and learn how to rotate better. There are several other awesome golf swing drills you can do with the TRS, including: club in front of the hands in takeaway, trace the line, and stand the club up to shallow it out in transition. \n\nIt's an awesome multipurpose tool and training aid you can practice with on the driving range or away from the golf course in your own home, perfect for developing a more pivot driven golf swing. Henry was first introduced to the TRS several years ago through the founder, Liam Bond, an excellent European Tour golf coach and former professional golfer himself. Since partnering, the TRS has been seen in the hands of Tommy Fleetwood, Robert Rock, and numerous other well-known players from across the pond. When Henry is out on the road caddying for his girlfriend, Dana Finkelstein, on the LPGA Tour, he always has a TRS on hand, and it's a tool we have used with Dana before to practice the exact exercises seen in this video.

One key aspect of learning and training new movements is how we feel changes. In this video, Henry and I look at whether it's better for you to resist or assist a desired golf swing change. You'll see us use various resistance band workouts in this video to demonstrate. When we workout at the gym, we are typically training our muscles to work through a resisted movement to gain strength, speed, and perhaps range of motion. However, when first mastering a new movement, it can be invaluable to use a lighter weight or be assisted by a coach or machine to establish good form. So as you will see in this video, both of these methods have a place.

As a coach, I have my preferences for the golf swing and the way someone ought to move (as laid out in most of the videos on this channel), however at the end of the day I coach the individual, not the method. With John G here, it was quickly evident that his back was not allowing him to perform certain movements the day of our lesson together. In our past lessons, the more rotational driven swing had worked well for him, but as you will see in this video, he was just not able to make that happen on this day with how badly his back was bothering him. I've also made a few videos in the past on the various ways to swing a golf club, and for John we went with one of these alternative approaches, one of freely elevating the club and letting gravity bring it back down. It seems simple, but it can really work if your body just isn't allowing other movements.
