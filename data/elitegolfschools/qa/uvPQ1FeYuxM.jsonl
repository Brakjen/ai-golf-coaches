It’s created by the drop and pelvic swivel, not one side more than the other. From there the hips move into extension as the upper body pulls you to the finish. A good feel is to drop and swivel while lighting up the posterior chain, let the club float as you drop, then spiral out to the finish.", "question_start": 130.96, "question_end": 142.96, "answer_start": 152.16, "answer_end": 256.56, "window_start": 5.44, "window_end": 3747.04, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:58:14.674111"}

Any mental tips or a focus that helps?", "answer": "Think like a throw: elongate tissue in transition instead of rushing. From about P3, let the handle work away as you drop, then swivel the pelvis before you fire. A simple drill: go to P3, gently pressure the handle toward the target/camera while you drop, then swivel, then go. The goal is drop–swivel–go so you load tissue (arms and body) and keep transition long and organized.", "question_start": 264.88, "question_end": 273.52, "answer_start": 281.76, "answer_end": 489.52, "window_start": 5.44, "window_end": 3747.04, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:58:14.674205"}

Where should you look at the ball at address?", "answer": "Most good players aren’t locked on a specific dimple; they often visualize their motion in third person. That said, experimenting can help: looking at the front of the ball can improve low point and strike for some players. You can also bias your gaze—outer half for a cut, inner half for a draw—so long as you don’t force it with poor body moves.

What should I feel for pressure in the left and right legs? I’ve been driving my right knee at the ball and it’s not working.", "answer": "The legs don’t drive the swing or create speed; they support it. Let pressure shift be driven by the rib cage, not by shoving the pelvis. Favor internal rotation of the femurs; avoid banking onto the insteps (eversion). Keep pressure more on the outer edges via inversion so the pelvis stays under you. Feel: turn the rib cage, drop the pelvis, then swivel—your knees and feet will respond. Don’t drive the right knee at the ball. Good references: Rory’s lead heel lands closer to target after the drop; Hovland’s trail heel gets thrown away as he turns.", "question_start": 719.68, "question_end": 737.36, "answer_start": 747.2, "answer_end": 1084.32, "window_start": 5.44, "window_end": 3747.04, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:58:14.674386"}

Fitting matters more as your technique stabilizes, primarily for proper gapping, launch/spin windows, and consistent shaft loading/feel through the set. Fit to where your swing is trending, not just today. Lie and loft (and how the sole interacts with turf) are most important; many players benefit from flatter lie angles, especially in irons and wedges. Aim for a set that feels consistent across the bag rather than obsessing over shaft labels.", "question_start": 1440.72, "question_end": 1450.16, "answer_start": 1450.16, "answer_end": 1999.76, "window_start": 5.44, "window_end": 3747.04, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:58:14.674464"}

If you bias the arms more across the chest (abduction), you’ll need more drop to reach the ball. If you lower the arms a lot, you’ll need less drop. Test extremes on video (too much vs. none) to find where you maintain speed, precision, and a consistent strike.

I see fades but with good distance. What would you suspect?", "answer": "If you’re striking it well, keep it. Divots should tend to point left post‑impact because the arc is moving left as the club exits. Don’t chase zeros or force divot direction; lies, grain, and roots can distort divot look. Focus on a qualitative map and ball control.

Typical metrics show about a 2:1 back‑to‑impact or roughly 1:1 back‑to‑finish cadence, and elite putters slightly decelerate into impact because the low point is under the sternum and the ball is forward. Change only the pressure you apply: more on slow/uphill, less on fast/downhill.

Prioritize rhythm first, then where the club moves in space and how your body supports that. Write your personal commandments (the few concepts that make you hit it best) and stick to them. It’s fine to have multiple thoughts if they fit your rhythm.
