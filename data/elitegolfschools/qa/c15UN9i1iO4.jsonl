If it's retracted in the backswing, does it protract in the downswing? Please explain how and when.", "answer": "At address both scaps are protracted. In the takeaway/backswing, protract the trail scap even more as the rib cage turns, keeping the arms in front. At the top, as you transition, drop and turn the chest away from the trail arm; that passively retracts the trail scap (do not try to actively yank it back). This passive retraction loads the posterior trail arm, then it bounces into anterior trail-arm load so you can release and hit.

With a tumble/pronation release, a late release holds the face open then flips shut—big hooks or blocks. We prefer an extension-to-flexion style release (stable, lower rate of rotation). Where you unload changes path: unloading earlier moves the path left sooner (for a right-hander), which makes controlling a cut easier; unloading very late keeps the path right longer, producing blocks or heavy draws/hooks. To tame hooks, unload earlier with an ext→flex pattern and avoid heavy forearm pronation that tumbles the face.", "question_start": 330.96, "question_end": 340.4, "answer_start": 340.4, "answer_end": 611.28, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3478.4809999999998, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:01:18.915773"}

Is it about dropping the club under the plane?", "answer": "Relative to the chest, the club’s COM should go up the sagittal plane and down the coronal plane. If you rotate the chest without getting the club deep enough in transition, the path goes left (pull-cut). Sequence it so the club gets deeper (behind you) first, then rotate—path stays from the inside without yanking left. You can nudge path by changing the order: get it deeper earlier for a block-draw bias; keep it more on top to bias a pull-cut.

Use a Think Box/Play Box routine: decide the shot behind the ball, then once you cross a decision line into the Play Box, pull the trigger within about 3 seconds.

To fix it I rotate my ribs so the trail shoulder goes under, which makes the left shoulder feel sky-high. You seem to release across your chest without that extreme left-shoulder-high—how?", "answer": "The across-chest move is fine; the timing is the key. The issue is early lead-shoulder rise (excessive right lateral bend) used to try to get the club under. In transition, shift the ribcage/CoM over the lead foot early while organizing the club down and back (deeper). At P6 keep the shoulders closer to level, then rotate hard.

How do you achieve that wrist movement with a strong left-hand grip?", "answer": "It’s not a contradiction. A stronger lead hand (more internal/pronated bias) is healthy and helps you shallow via internal humerus and posterior/spiral arm-line loads. Grip strength changes how you lever: with a strong grip, you can bias radial loading in the backswing and keep the lead wrist more extended/neutral in transition—the face is already strong, so you don’t need big lead-wrist flexion to square it; release toward ulnar with a quiet, stable face. With a weaker/neutral grip you’ll typically add more lead-wrist flexion to strengthen the face, then release. Both patterns can create speed; match the mix of radial/ulnar and extension/flexion to your grip and keep the humerus more internal for depth and joint health.", "question_start": 2921.84, "question_end": 2954.32, "answer_start": 2963.04, "answer_end": 3422.88, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3478.4809999999998, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:01:18.916283"}
