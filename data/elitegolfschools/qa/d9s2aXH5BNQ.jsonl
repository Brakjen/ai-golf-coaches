Does it precede the lead spiral or happen simultaneously?", "answer": "“Hip turn” in golf usually means rotating the pelvis, not actively twisting the femurs in the sockets. I use “pelvic swivel” to cue actively rotating the pelvis under the rib cage while keeping the femurs more passive, which loads the spiral lines without shoving the pelvis toward the target. You can elongate the spiral either by upper‑body spiral (rib cage motion) or by pelvic swivel—both tighten the same tissue band. Avoid the common mistake of “rotating the hips” by sliding the pelvis toward the target (early extension), which forces counter‑tilt and stresses the low back. Instead, swivel the pelvis so it stays under the rib cage as you load the spiral, then rotate through. It’s essentially a different lens on the same spiral mechanics, and it should integrate with the lead spiral rather than fight it.", "question_start": 158.8, "question_end": 177.2, "answer_start": 187.48, "answer_end": 636.8, "window_start": 0.24, "window_end": 3617.319, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:07.703149"}

Build a personal “recipe” for why you play well (e.g., your best swing feels, shot shape, tempo, or delivery/impact ownership) and commit to that on every shot. Strategically, think driving it well and wedging to lots of makeable looks—don’t chase a target score. On course, pick safe start lines and commit to a swing that lets the ball fall either way. Keep technical work light and supportive of what makes you great; your pre‑shot focus should be on your trusted feels (start, transition, through‑impact) and making committed decisions and swings.", "question_start": 645.28, "question_end": 653.84, "answer_start": 663.44, "answer_end": 1125.12, "window_start": 0.24, "window_end": 3617.319, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:07.703254"}

If the right hip goes back on ~45°, what do the shoulders do to create that stretch?", "answer": "In transition you load the posterior spiral: maintain trunk angle and trail‑femur angle as you “drop” (increase hip flexion) to expand the posterior chain (glutes/hamstrings/calf). Expanded tissue is loaded tissue. Then use pelvic swivel and rib‑cage rotation to trade spirals—posterior load into anterior/upper spiral—to deliver and rotate to finish.

Feel the lead pec/ribs and even the head move off the “front wall” in the backswing so you have room to drop and rotate without having to extend or slide. The trail‑armpit‑back cue is fine, but don’t overspiral or shove the pelvis toward the target.

Between P4 and P6, should the face be more open or more closed?", "answer": "It depends on your grip and preferred release. Stronger grips or players who like a more rotary, face‑stable release can carry a more closed bias. Players who want the toe to pass more (toe release) should keep the face more neutral‑to‑slightly open from P4–P6 so it can release without flip‑hooking. Match the grip to the release: check grip first. Through impact, use the upper‑spiral (rib cage) to pull you away from the ball as the club releases; avoid trying to “glute fire” the pelvis forward.

Any drill to sync the shift and get the right side moving?", "answer": "Actively internally rotate the trail femur (glute med) as the upper spiral drives you—this loads the right glute and causes the trail foot to supinate/everting toward the outer edge, putting pressure into the last three toes and letting the heel get thrown up.
