Avoid initiating with lead-arm adduction and internal rotation, which, combined with early chest turn, drags the club under the plane.

Instead, in transition first drop the pelvis (deepen knee and hip angles), then let the ribcage (upper spiral) rotation pull the pelvis open as a response. The knees react late.

This raises face-rate (more rotation through impact), can stall the pelvis, and often stresses the lumbar. Hitter: drop the pelvis in transition, then rotate the chest; the arms strike out of the chest via lead-arm adduction and trail-arm abduction. This lowers face-rate, improves low-point control, and is typically healthier—without sacrificing ball speed.

From roughly halfway down, the trail arm abducts and the lead arm adducts across the chest while the trunk rotates—this is the hit. First drop the pelvis to set trunk pitch, then rotate the ribcage; supination/release happens late. Avoid yanking the handle down (you’ll stand up and spike face rotation).

Are there prerequisite movements to swing better?", "answer": "Yes—movement quality is foundational. A healthy gait is the prerequisite.

That same spiral organization powers the golf swing: ribs lead, pelvis follows, arms respond. Train gait and spiral mechanics to improve swing function and durability.
