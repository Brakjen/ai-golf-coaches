In transition toward P5 the left shoulder will be lower than the right, then keep turning level around the trunk into and through impact.

Does height factor into it?", "answer": "Yes. Shorter players can keep a more level shoulder axis because it’s easier to get the transverse plane down to the ball.

Too wide encourages inside‑ankle‑bone‑low (eversion) and poor foot mechanics.

My shoulders lead and I get too open at impact. Any drill or feel?", "answer": "Skip the idea of a leftward hip shift. Start opening before the club finishes the backswing: rotate the pelvis away from the ball and target while the ribs move forward so pressure shifts lead‑side without spinning out.
