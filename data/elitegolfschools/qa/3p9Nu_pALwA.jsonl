How can I fix this while keeping my maps consistent?", "answer": "You're seeing parallax error, which gets worse as the club gets longer (especially driver). With putter your eyes are over the line so you don’t see it, but with driver you’re off to the side, so square can look left. Set the club to the target first (shaft perpendicular to the target line when you look down), then align your body parallel to the club’s line—face the club, don’t face the target. It will feel way left at first, but that feeling is actually square. Train the routine: balance the club to the target, then match your feet/knees/hips/shoulders parallel to it before looking up.", "question_start": 227.28, "question_end": 235.52, "answer_start": 235.52, "answer_end": 584.64, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 3513.52, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:54:59.217123"}

Lay it on your target line and make your feet equidistant from the stick—\"face the wall\" the stick represents. With longer clubs, stand farther but still face that wall, then set the club and match your body parallel. On the range, set up square and look at the target—you’ll feel crazy left (that’s square). Hit shots a touch right, left, and at the target to calibrate.

Rory: upper body starts rotating, pelvis follows, then he drops while continuing to rotate in the same space—pelvis COM migrates forward/left while he stays back-chained, the handle gets deeper, and that supports a draw. Hovland: he begins rotating out earlier as he sets the club to the top, maintains back-chain but gets the ribs more forward, the handle tracks more out, supporting a cut.

To locomote, the trail hip hikes (lat/glute/oblique shorten) to free the trail foot—same in golf to create space to send the club out on the transverse plane. The pattern is hike-and-bury: backswing (lead hip hikes, trail hip buries) then transition (trail hip hikes, lead hip buries) while the ribs rotate, which keeps the pelvis effectively level and the feet working (heels away, inside ankle bones high).

Should I use the same action in chipping?", "answer": "No. Negative alpha loads a lot of tissue—great for full-swing speed, overkill for chipping. For chips/pitches, keep the club on a more vertical swing plane (VSSP): up and down with minimal shallow/outward path. Get pressure forward early, control low point/angle of attack, and make an authoritative strike.

Do you agree, and can you train that?", "answer": "You can see that pattern, but it’s mostly a byproduct, not a cue. In transition, arms still elevating while you drop produces some spinal extension and apparent anterior tilt. Through the strike, firing the arms out (scapular protraction) puts the spine back into flexion and the pelvis into posterior tilt. Don’t micromanage lumbar flex/extend—your lumbar doesn’t love big ranges.

In a full swing, is there any active trail-wrist dorsiflexion? And aside from tissue loading, how do hand actions differ between full swing and a pitch/distance wedge?", "answer": "With a neutral grip, radial deviation keeps the face square to your trunk tilt—there’s not much need for active trail-wrist extension unless you also add gamma (face rotation) to keep the leading edge aligned. For short game, feel the face pointing more toward the ground relative to your trunk and check video—the leading edge should track square to your trunk through radial. Release: full swing preference is trail wrist extension-to-flexion and lead wrist flexion-to-extension with minimal supination/pronation—keeps the face square while you turn.
