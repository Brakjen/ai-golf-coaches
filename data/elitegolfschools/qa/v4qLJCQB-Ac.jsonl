Check your driver numbers on a launch monitor: ideal smash factor around 1.5, launch about 13–15 degrees, and spin roughly 2000–2500 rpm so you’re converting speed into distance. For speed itself, add vertical force. In transition, lower the pelvis (a small drop) so you can push up through the ground—drop then rotate and extend. Older players can let the lead foot step out as you turn to free up the jump and release. A simple drill: from the top, feel the pelvis drop, then turn and push up (\"drop—go\"); stepping the lead foot out as you rotate can add easy speed.", "question_start": 92.72, "question_end": 100.76, "answer_start": 100.76, "answer_end": 303.48, "window_start": 1.12, "window_end": 1923.8799999999999, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:06:03.925995"}

The goal is ball control. Use the same delivery, then direct the \"wave of energy\" (club and body) to start the ball where you want.

He often intends to get the club up, let the arms/hands lower toward the right hip, then turn—some traits of both a \"hitter\" and a \"swinger.\" Our priority is organizing the engine first (pelvis, spine, ribs), then matching the arms. All players lower the arms some, move them across the body some, and cycle the lead arm from internal to external—just to different degrees. A healthy model is drop the pelvis and rotate the chest so tissues flow in the same direction; then match the arms to that.

Instead, move proximal-to-distal: turn the ribcage first while keeping the hands in front of the chest and the trail arm on top of the lead.
