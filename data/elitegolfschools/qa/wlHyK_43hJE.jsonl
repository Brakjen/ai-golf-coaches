You actively hit with the arms and hands; the pivot (pelvis/ribs) supports that action. Load tissue (create tension via elongation) and then compress it to strike. A huge share of distance (around 85–90%) comes from the arms/hands. 2) I do not prefer a lat‑dominant, scapular‑retraction hit. Better is keeping both scaps more protracted through impact and sending energy out of the chest; lat‑dominant patterns tend to pull the arm down/around, can destabilize the face, and may increase injury risk. Some elite players (e.g., Scheffler) do it, but it trends toward lower‑back/neck/scap issues. 3) GRF is always there—don’t chase vertical “jump” spikes that extend the hips, stall the chest, and force an arm throw. Stay dropped, rotate the rib cage, and strike. Focus on the swing’s shape qualitatively; use force numbers later only to confirm the pattern.", "question_start": 131.2, "question_end": 149.52, "answer_start": 149.52, "answer_end": 809.44, "window_start": 0.4, "window_end": 3559.0389999999998, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:59:11.589770"}

It’s slight hip flexion without pitching the knees or just sticking the butt out; keep the trunk away from the ball and create tension in the posterior chain. From the top, with shoulders ~90° and hips ~45°, sit toward that 45° chair—this drop itself shifts pressure back into the lead foot (you don’t shift first; the drop does it).

Create it via pressure/loading in the handle while you turn. Two good wrist‑load options: 1) radial “hammer” load (toe up)—face more open at the top (draw‑bias), or 2) slight pronation with lead‑wrist extension (DJ‑style)—stronger face (fade‑bias).
