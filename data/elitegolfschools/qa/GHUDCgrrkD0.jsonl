I’ve tried different feels but it stays the same. Any drills or ideas to fix this?", "answer": "Prefer a more vertical shoulder axis with the lead arm elevating, adducting across the chest, and slightly internally rotating. If your arms get too vertical you likely have too much shoulder flexion and not enough adduction. Drill: place a glove under the trail armpit, make your spiral turn, then lift and adduct the lead arm while keeping the trail upper arm connected (don’t let the glove drop until after impact/finish). Aim for the lead arm more across the chest with slight internal rotation at the top. Balance shoulder flexion vs. adduction to arrive on-plane, which makes transition and strike easier.", "question_start": 192.64, "question_end": 202.16, "answer_start": 209.36, "answer_end": 386.24, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3458.68, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:15.334149"}

Also, you often show the hit in front of the lead foot—should impact be more central? Where should the pivot happen?", "answer": "For longer clubs you need to unload the arms/hands/club earlier. Load the posterior lead-arm line and anterior trail-arm line into delivery, then mirror that sling on the through side sooner with longer clubs so launch increases. Keep the pivot and bottom-out the same; adjust the timing of the unload so the shaft doesn’t stay trapped and delofted too long. The chest rotation is still your face stabilizer, but the longer the club, the earlier the arm/club release trades from trail-to-lead slings. That keeps height while maintaining a consistent pivot.", "question_start": 395.2, "question_end": 430.08, "answer_start": 430.08, "answer_end": 653.28, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3458.68, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:15.334253"}

Pros look slightly open, but you seem to prefer feeling almost completely open. Is that feel or real?", "answer": "Don’t judge openness from down-the-line; right lateral bend makes shoulders look more square than they are. Evaluate from face-on: good players have the sternum and shoulder axis rotated left at impact, with varying amounts of right lateral bend. Everyone turns; the lateral bend changes the apparent shoulder tilt. So yes, players are open, but the look is affected by side bend—don’t chase an extreme down-the-line appearance.", "question_start": 662.72, "question_end": 670.4, "answer_start": 678.08, "answer_end": 933.68, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3458.68, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:15.334319"}

Distance control is decent, but I push and pull putts. How can I fix this?", "answer": "Use the “ghost” drill to keep the head and eyes stable: stare at a blade of grass under the ball, stroke it, and keep your eyes there long enough to see the dark afterimage (the ghost) where the ball was; then listen for the ball to drop. Define a make as executing the routine: look at hole, back to ball, stroke, see the ghost, listen. Also standardize pace: aim for about 17 inches past the hole on all putts inside ~15 feet.

Pros look like they thrust up/left/forward with the back leg so the pelvis tilts forward at impact—how does that mesh with the swivel?", "answer": "Drop happens late backswing (P3–P4): pelvis lowers as the lead arm continues to lift/adduct. Swivel happens P4–P5: pelvis switches you from lead lateral bend to trail lateral bend, organizing the arms and shallowing the club. Extension should be reactive to the upper spiral pulling, not an active early thrust toward the target. Drills: stand close to a wall and “stay away” during drop and swivel (avoid bumping the wall); chair/wall or ball/BOSU pressure drills to feel the pelvis drop away ~45° then swivel; slow reps of “drop–swivel–hit” to exaggerate awareness; throw-and-catch drill against a wall to feel internal rotation and the arm/torso organization.

I’m worried I get into the heel too early.", "answer": "Preferred pattern: trail foot pressure loads to its heel as you finish the backswing; as you drop, pressure spikes into the ball of the lead foot (lead knee flexes); after the swivel and rotation continue, pressure moves into the lead heel and finishes on the outer edge of the lead heel.

How is that possible with both hands on the club? It seems like once the arms are set, the main move is just swiveling the pelvis fast enough to deliver the club—right?", "answer": "The ‘gap’ is the space between the lead arm and ribcage and the trail arm structure around P6. With a stronger lead-hand grip and a more internally rotated lead arm, the face stays strong, which lets the trail arm adduct ‘through’ that space as you drop. If the lead hand is weak, you’re forced to lower and externally rotate the lead arm to square the face, which makes the trail arm go over the top. Organize grip/lead-arm internal rotation, then feel pressure through that gap as you swivel and turn—this maintains shaft load without tumbling the face.", "question_start": 2842.48, "question_end": 2878.0, "answer_start": 2878.0, "answer_end": 3066.24, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3458.68, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:15.334723"}

Is it simply the top spiral motoring the body through the ball?", "answer": "Backswing loads the lead spiral (lead lateral bend). The swivel trades you into trail lateral bend (loads the opposite spiral) without needing an upper-body move. From there the upper spiral line continues to pull the chest through, which tows the pelvis under as a response.

My trail hip and elbow interfere or my lower back feels unprotected. Any thoughts on hip–shoulder separation while protecting the lower back?", "answer": "Start with equipment: use shorter shafts and much flatter lie angles than standard. Long arms make standard clubs play too upright; flatter lies (even 5–7° flat on a test 6-iron) and shorter length let you adduct more and drop-and-turn like Hogan without the trail elbow/hip crowding.
