Don’t keep the trail elbow pinned or high; let it straighten as you send the club down and out, which lowers the head into the sand behind the ball.

Heavy scap protraction puts you in thoracic flexion; as the lead arm adducts and lifts, the thoracic spine extends. With the drop you’ll see even more extension, then you return to flexion through the hit, and extend again into finish.

At the top they’re trail-side of it. In transition the rib turn moves the sagittal plane away from the hands, so the arms adduct across the chest (trail arm adduction, lead arm abduction) to fully load.

I think my body/hips are outpacing; the handle crowds my pelvis. Thoughts?", "answer": "Being stuck means the trail elbow drifts into the posterior space (behind the shirt seam/coronal plane). Two fixes: 1) In transition rotate and migrate the pelvis away from the ball to create room; 2) Lower the trail arm with shoulder extension plus adduction, add some supination to set depth, and keep the trail elbow in the anterior space.

The swivel bounces you between opposing spiral lines to load and unload tissue (spine engine), which creates speed. At the same time a stable, well-timed pelvis–rib-cage unit lets the distal segments (arms/club) accelerate faster.

Also, is pelvic drop straight down or at 45°?", "answer": "Yes—blend supination with the windshield-wiper while maintaining the set wrist extensions (the lead wrist stays extended in loading and through the wipe).

Do you agree, and what are the mechanics?", "answer": "It can be a good image if you pair it with proper spine engine. Rotate into trail side, then use under mechanics: scap retract/depress before protracting to drive the uppercut. Keep the pelvis back (don’t pop up toward the ball), rotate the ribs through, and let the lead leg post as you deliver the punch.

Can you drop too early or too late, and is there a sweet spot?", "answer": "Sweet spot: start the drop between P3 and P4, or at P4 while keeping the arms up. Too early is right from the takeaway; too late is running the arms down first and then dropping.

With longer, flatter-faced clubs you actively release earlier along the transverse plane to add dynamic loft—higher launch, lower spin—yet keep the face square.

Is that common, and any tips if it’s from the rib-cage shallowing move?", "answer": "Totally common and often good—less runoff, more control. Don’t chase length with arm runoff.
