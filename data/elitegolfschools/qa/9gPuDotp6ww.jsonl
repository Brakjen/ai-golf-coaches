With a 6-iron, good targets are roughly AOA ≈ -5, path about +4 (inside-out), and face either equal to path for a straight block or a bit less (e.g., face +2 with path +4) for a small block-draw. Low point and AOA track closely; get the ribcage forward at impact to move low point forward while keeping the clubhead deep enough behind you so you can start the ball right with a stable face.", "question_start": 294.64, "question_end": 303.12, "answer_start": 303.12, "answer_end": 498.08, "window_start": 23.039, "window_end": 3671.6000000000004, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:56:34.041589"}

I think I’m dropping the pelvis and getting the club too shallow, and my arms collapse into the finish. How do I fix this?", "answer": "You’re likely invading the space (head and chest drifting toward the ball), which forces a handle pull-in and toe contact. As you shallow and drop, keep your head/chest away from the ball and increase that space while you turn. Let centrifugal force send the club out on a transverse plane (around your chest) rather than yanking it in. Shallow enough that, as you turn, you can “tabletop” the club out; expect a few heel contacts at first as you learn to send energy outward.", "question_start": 506.08, "question_end": 515.44, "answer_start": 515.44, "answer_end": 662.96, "window_start": 23.039, "window_end": 3671.6000000000004, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:56:34.041696"}

Keep the kneecaps essentially pointing forward while the pelvis turns into each hip: trail hip goes into internal rotation in the backswing while the lead hip goes more external as the pelvis turns away from it, then you reverse that in transition.

My feel is to use hands/wrists to move the club’s center of mass behind me while I make good body moves. Is that right?", "answer": "Yes—educate your hands, but let the body do the main shallowing. The key is the ribcage and spine switching from lead lateral bend in the backswing to trail lateral bend in transition (“fish mode”), with the pelvis and ribs counter-moving. That motion shallows the club naturally; then use the hands to fine-tune depth and face.

I tend to get steep or hit fat when I do the hip drop.", "answer": "Think forward swing, not down swing. The purpose of the pelvic drop is to angle your chest down so you can swing the arms out of your chest, not yank the handle.

Excess early extension in the trail hip limits rotation and sends the club out toward the ball.
