Club length dictates trunk pitch: shorter clubs require more bend; longer clubs stand you taller. Down-the-line check: drop a line from the shoulder socket—on irons the butt of the grip/hand instep should live roughly under that line. With driver the hands sit farther from the thighs because of the longer shaft, but the arms are still on top of the chest. If you set up heel‑loaded or crowd the ball you’ll tend to move into it; if you’re too far, you’ll reach and lose arm‑on‑chest structure. Use the club’s length to set trunk pitch and keep the arms on the chest in both cases.", "question_start": 110.16, "question_end": 118.64, "answer_start": 118.64, "answer_end": 343.52, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 3856.039, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:34.077766"}

Can you show how to keep the hips centered while doing that?", "answer": "Banking is pronating the foot (collapsing the arch). Actively banking drives the knee inward, adducts the femur, and laterally sways the pelvis—often leading to early extension, out‑of‑sequence tilts, and stress to the low back and trail arm. Prefer keeping the inside ankle bone high or feeling the heel \"thrown away\" so the pelvis can drop and swivel without lateral sway and the rib cage can move over the ball. That preserves trunk balance, makes slotting easier, and reduces injury risk. Cue: drop, keep inside ankle bone high/heel away, swivel the pelvis under you while the rib cage moves, then let the upper body pull you up.", "question_start": 343.52, "question_end": 359.64, "answer_start": 359.64, "answer_end": 766.52, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 3856.039, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:34.077899"}

How do we use them for more speed and power?", "answer": "The lower body isn’t passive; it’s supportive and active in the drop. When you drop the pelvis, ground reaction force briefly decreases (you’re lighter). As you spiral/rotate back up, force increases (you weigh more on a scale), producing the GRF spike seen in good swings. You don’t need to cue a jump—hip and knee extension are largely a passive response to the upper spiral pulling you up. For speed: drop the pelvis to load the posterior spiral line, swivel the pelvis, then let the upper body’s spiral pull you up; that naturally creates the force pattern without contrived pushes.", "question_start": 766.52, "question_end": 786.04, "answer_start": 786.04, "answer_end": 1162.32, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 3856.039, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:34.077999"}

Is it under the lead shoulder/arm/leg, or under the sternum at impact? Is there a different low point for each club? Are the shoulders slightly open at impact?", "answer": "Low point is primarily governed by the center of mass of your rib cage (sternum) at strike, because the arms attach to the ribs, not the pelvis. The pelvis can influence it, but the preferred look is a dropped pelvis with the rib cage slightly forward so low point is just ahead of the ball on irons. Typical AoA: wedges ~8–12 down, mid‑irons ~4–6 down, woods around 0 to ~1 down, driver can be up a few degrees (some are slightly down). Shoulders are usually a bit open at impact due to target‑bias tilt. Different clubs don’t have unique low‑point ‘spots’; club length, ball position, and AoA change where the ball sits relative to the sternum and the club’s bottoming‑out.", "question_start": 1162.32, "question_end": 1195.32, "answer_start": 1195.32, "answer_end": 1695.56, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 3856.039, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:34.078113"}

Feet slightly closed with the shoulders a few degrees open points your bottom‑out ahead and helps you \"cover\" the ball.

It can work but raises face rotation rate and stress. (2) Preferred/healthier: lead humerus moves from internal toward neutral as the rib cage turns, the arms protract and \"shoot out,\" and the elbow can be slightly bent, then goes neutral post‑impact (a Fleetwood‑style finish).

I lift my chin up/back to make room for the shoulder—helpful or not?", "answer": "Both eyes on the ball can help depth perception, but don’t force it. Let the head ride the spine. Preferred sequence: address with C‑ and T‑spine in flexion (eyes more down); in transition the pelvic drop puts the spine into extension (eyes may track slightly up); through impact you return to flexion (eyes back down); then extend into finish.
