When does the lead arm internally rotate and abduct? Please clarify thumbs down and suggest drills.", "answer": "They’re not the same. Orion’s Belt = keep three points (lead elbow, hands/handle, and the club’s center of mass) on one plane through the swing. That preserves arm/club structure during the backswing, transition, and through impact. “Thumbs down” can be misleading because you can point the thumb down by twisting the forearm/hand without actually rotating the humerus; it often breaks structure. Prioritize humeral rotation and adduction/abduction of the lead arm, not wrist-only moves. Practical cues: maintain the Orion’s Belt plane from takeaway to the top; in transition keep the same elbow–hand–COM relationship as you turn; avoid actively dragging the lead arm down the ribcage (which forces external rotation and changes structure). Drills: slow-motion swings maintaining the three-point plane; checkpoint at the top (elbow–hand–COM coplanar), then rehearse transition and early downswing preserving that plane; mirror or alignment board to verify the plane. This lets the club square with fewer hand flips and keeps structure intact longer.", "question_start": 131.84, "question_end": 147.52, "answer_start": 156.24, "answer_end": 434.72, "window_start": 2.439, "window_end": 3424.48, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:19.086152"}
