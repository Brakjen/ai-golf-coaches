How do I keep it loaded?", "answer": "Keep it simple: map your sequence to no load, load, unload. Turn your chest early with the arms staying down and relaxed while you hinge the club up (no load). As the arms start to lift, let the ribs begin to drop/turn the other way (load). Then fire the arms (unload). Avoid obsessing over spiral feet/pelvis details at first—get the arm lines loaded and unloaded at the right times, with the club up on the way back, under on the way down, then release.", "question_start": 118.4, "question_end": 129.2, "answer_start": 136.64, "answer_end": 307.76, "window_start": 6.72, "window_end": 3587.198, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:54:43.133719"}

How do I fix that?", "answer": "A spin-out is rotating the pelvis while the chest/pressure stays back on the trail foot. Fix it by moving pressure forward with the rib cage as the pelvis drops and swivels. Feel the rib cage go forward enough as you rotate so you’re not stuck back—no excessive lateral bend or spine extension. Pelvis swivel plus rib cage forward equals no spin-out.", "question_start": 320.72, "question_end": 330.16, "answer_start": 330.16, "answer_end": 405.36, "window_start": 6.72, "window_end": 3587.198, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:54:43.133799"}

How do I prevent that?", "answer": "Keep the knee inside its ‘sphere’ (imagine a basketball at the knee) as you internally rotate the femur. Watch in a mirror: rotate without letting the knee migrate inward. You should feel pressure on the outstep with inside ankle bone high and a bow to the leg. Do this on both sides.

You need a passive window to elongate tissues and arm lines to create tension you’ll then contract. Turn fully with relaxed arms and hinge the club, then lift/adduct the lead arm as your body starts forward—this elongates and loads tissue so you can fire. Think no load, load, unload, and keep the club’s geometry reasonable so the float isn’t wasted.", "question_start": 643.52, "question_end": 674.24, "answer_start": 674.24, "answer_end": 937.12, "window_start": 6.72, "window_end": 3587.198, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:54:43.133935"}

You can over-drop so your plane points inside the ball, or over-shallow (rare but possible). Explore within reason, then settle into the range where contact, direction, and speed stabilize—those are your system’s bookends.", "question_start": 1225.52, "question_end": 1239.92, "answer_start": 1239.92, "answer_end": 1351.44, "window_start": 6.72, "window_end": 3587.198, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:54:43.133981"}

It lets you drive the rib cage forward with rotation instead of posting up front and rolling the arms. Rear-post supports getting the ribs through the shot and matches our preferred pivot.", "question_start": 1832.4, "question_end": 1844.08, "answer_start": 1844.08, "answer_end": 1891.52, "window_start": 6.72, "window_end": 3587.198, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:54:43.134019"}

Which shoulder plane would you favor, and what thumb-based feels would you suggest?", "answer": "Skip shoulder-plane and thumb feels. Learn to fade by putting the clubhead down and behind you on the trail side, then use your pivot to start the ball left while keeping the face’s rate of closure low. Don’t shove the club ‘over’ and then tilt back—that spikes face rotation. Get it down, keep the pivot forward, curve the handle through the hit, and the face will behave for a dependable cut.", "question_start": 1929.2, "question_end": 1948.48, "answer_start": 1958.32, "answer_end": 2183.28, "window_start": 6.72, "window_end": 3587.198, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:54:43.134080"}

Don’t force shoulder elevation or lateral bend; supinate, then rotate the ribs through and the lead shoulder will naturally end up higher. Arm actions through impact: feel supination, adduction, and shoulder extension. The lead arm abducts with internal rotation; any external rotation happens naturally—don’t force it.

Extension happens from angular momentum when you’ve got good mass and forces. Prioritize shoulder extension and scapular depression while rotating through; the trail elbow will extend as a byproduct. Actively throwing elbow extension only hurts sequence and contact.", "question_start": 2701.28, "question_end": 2720.72, "answer_start": 2720.72, "answer_end": 2782.4, "window_start": 6.72, "window_end": 3587.198, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:54:43.134194"}

I’m losing the shape as I start.", "answer": "For you, yes—feel the clubhead go all the way down behind you first, even exaggerate it, then ‘fishtail’ to match. That encourages the ribs to go through and the booty to drop, syncing your sequence.

He moves the elbow across his midline and extends to load the posterior arm line and handle toward the lead side before turning—preventing an early, sloppy arm load.

Should the arms wipe across the body? If so, how?", "answer": "Yes—think lead-arm abduction across your chest while the ribs drive forward and the pelvis counters. Get the ribs forward between P3 and P5 so the shoulders float forward, then fire the arms across and ‘out of your chest’ with pressure forward.
