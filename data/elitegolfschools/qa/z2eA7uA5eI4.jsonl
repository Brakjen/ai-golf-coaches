As the handle finishes up and away, the body drops/rotates/lateral-shifts in the opposite direction, which adds lead-arm adduction and shoulder flexion and loads the posterior lead-arm line. Then he fires it: the pivot keeps turning while the lead arm begins to abduct through impact, creating space between the lead humerus and ribcage. Players who early-extend and push the pelvis forward have to lower the arm down the ribcage and roll it, losing that space. The goal is load then release—don’t pin and drag the lead arm. The clubhead can stay on the trail side as the body turns, but the arm is loaded and then unloaded with the pivot.", "question_start": 362.0, "question_end": 387.32, "answer_start": 387.32, "answer_end": 713.68, "window_start": 0.24, "window_end": 1997.639, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:27.371618"}

That drop/turn sends the handle slightly over the backswing plane, then as you keep turning the handle follows a pronounced inward (left) arc through and after impact. In a \"hitter\" pattern (e.g., Hovland) the clubhead shallows behind while the handle stays relatively up; continued turn makes the handle move left while the clubhead unloads from deep, producing a stable block‑draw with the face moving right as the handle goes left. In a \"swinger\" pattern (e.g., Rose), the lead arm stays adducted and lowers down the chest; the handle stays under the club’s center of mass longer, you tend to rise/extend, stall rotation, and the release shows more lead‑arm external rotation/supination with a more gradual handle arc that exits more to the right. The same map applies to driver and irons; with driver you extend/unload earlier due to higher energy, so the handle’s arc can be a bit less severe, but the principles don’t change.", "question_start": 722.92, "question_end": 741.44, "answer_start": 750.36, "answer_end": 1242.32, "window_start": 0.24, "window_end": 1997.639, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:27.371754"}

How do you deal with this on the range?", "answer": "Use a structured practice Triad: Build, then Test/Challenge, then back as needed. In Build, work only on your key skills with zero concern for ball flight (e.g., pelvic drop in transition, getting the clubhead deeper). Build awareness of the moves, their sequence, and rhythm. When those show up in the right order, the strike will \"seek you out.\" Don’t overcook—once you feel in‑system, move to Test: apply the same map across clubs, trajectories, and energies (take off 15 yards, different clubs, flights). If you \"lose it,\" return to Build to re‑establish the key feels, then go back to Test. Cycling this way keeps you in control mentally, avoids the fear spiral, and ties ball‑striking to good mapping and matchups rather than chasing results swing‑to‑swing.", "question_start": 1242.32, "question_end": 1266.88, "answer_start": 1277.24, "answer_end": 1812.76, "window_start": 0.24, "window_end": 1997.639, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:27.371866"}
