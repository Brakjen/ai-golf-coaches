Is it at the left shoulder, and how does it differ for wedges versus driver?", "answer": "Low point is governed by the center of mass of the rib cage (think sternum), not the left shoulder. The rib cage moves slightly off the ball in the backswing, then drops and shifts forward in transition. The club bottoms out under the sternum. For driver, we want the low point behind the ball so the club is ascending slightly at impact (about 2–3 degrees up), which reduces spin loft and maximizes ball speed. For wedges, we want the low point in front of the ball so the club is descending at impact, increasing spin loft for lower launch and higher spin. Setup and ball position relative to your rib cage, plus the amount of energy in the swing, influence how far forward the rib cage moves and where the bottom occurs. More energy with driver extends the system earlier and keeps the rib cage from working as far forward; with wedges, stay dropped in longer so the rib cage is more forward at impact.", "question_start": 142.24, "question_end": 159.44, "answer_start": 159.44, "answer_end": 568.56, "window_start": 4.64, "window_end": 3694.559, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:41.696612"}

Use a spiral pattern: combine right-side lateral bend with the rib cage moving forward (left for a right‑handed player) as the body rotates. The right shoulder stays relatively tall while the lead shoulder elevates; avoid a throwing pattern where the scap elevates and goes over, and avoid simply tilting right which dumps stress into the lumbar spine. Think of the trail armpit being pulled forward and slightly under as the rib cage moves targetward; the rib cage moves away from the ball and the right hip does not invade the space, creating room for the strike.", "question_start": 639.12, "question_end": 647.52, "answer_start": 655.36, "answer_end": 874.32, "window_start": 4.64, "window_end": 3694.559, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:41.696820"}

I tend to over-rotate the hips going back, straighten the trail leg, and get on the trail toe too early in the downswing.", "answer": "Those issues come from laterally shoving the pelvis. That straightens the trail leg, pushes the right hip too deep, and moves the rib cage closer to the ball, forcing compensation and early extension. Stay dropped in instead of swaying. Feel like you are squeezing a lemon between the trail hip and torso while turning the chest; keep the hip line quieter initially and let the chest do the early rotation. Dropping eliminates the lateral shove, keeps the pelvis supportive under you, maintains trunk balance (rib cage not drifting closer to the ball), and gives you space to deliver the club.", "question_start": 882.72, "question_end": 900.24, "answer_start": 900.24, "answer_end": 1111.36, "window_start": 4.64, "window_end": 3694.559, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:41.696982"}

Also, in your short game class you say use the leading edge for chipping and the bounce for pitching, but both setups are toe down. How do I engage the leading edge for chips?", "answer": "Bounce is the sole geometry that presents when the club is soled; toe‑down changes face aim because loft points the face. Toe‑down opens the face, so to square it you toe‑in (rotate the shaft closed) to offset that. For chipping, go heavy toe‑down and toe‑in so the face is square; this exposes the leading edge and shrinks the sole’s effective surface area, making turf interaction simpler and allowing a knifey, driving chip (great even into the grain). For pitching, set the club so the sole/bounce engages; a slight toe‑down lets the toe slow in the turf so the heel keeps moving, maintaining loft even on a slightly heavy strike. Be assertive through impact; the bounce glides rather than bounces. With high loft, start direction is path‑driven, so don’t simply open the face and then cut across. Instead, align the path at the target and use a nearly neutral lie with a touch of toe‑down to keep loft on. Avoid heel‑down, which speeds the toe, de‑lofts, and can cause a drop‑kick.", "question_start": 1141.04, "question_end": 1164.64, "answer_start": 1174.6, "answer_end": 1774.48, "window_start": 4.64, "window_end": 3694.559, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:41.697231"}

What exactly should I practice?", "answer": "Both can work; the key is the match between an early unload and a forward move. Start with about 60–70% pressure on the trail foot and 30–40% on the lead at address. Swing back, then unload the club (UD: lead the leading edge straight down) while making a lateral lunge forward with the ribs and head so the sternum works over the ball. Square to slightly closed alignments make this easier than standing open. Many players benefit from feeling the lead arm move across the chest as they lunge, then spiral up a slight forward axis. Do not let the sternum rock back relative to the pelvis in the short game; that is a death move. Use this mapping for pitches, bunker shots, and distance wedges.", "question_start": 1791.12, "question_end": 1800.0, "answer_start": 1807.28, "answer_end": 2117.76, "window_start": 4.64, "window_end": 3694.559, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:41.697410"}

One is to lower the arms via shoulder extension, but that often forces the hips to extend to make room. The preferred way is to drop the pelvis in transition so the trunk inclines toward the ball; then the lead arm can abduct relative to the chest and the hands lower relative to the ground without losing posture. This is the difference between patterns: a swinger pattern has the upper arm glide on the chest, while a hitter pattern has the upper arm come off the chest. Both can work, but using the drop to orient the trunk to the ball lets you lower the hands without early extension.", "question_start": 2134.08, "question_end": 2152.28, "answer_start": 2152.28, "answer_end": 2403.28, "window_start": 4.64, "window_end": 3694.559, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:41.697539"}

Should I be concerned, including timing-wise?", "answer": "A short backswing by itself is not a problem; many elite bombers have short backswings. What matters is how the spiral line and arm lines coordinate to produce speed, precision, and a healthy strike. You do not need to change timing just because it is short; change only if the motion is inefficient.

How is that healthy?", "answer": "Injury risk concentrates most often in the lumbar spine when players over‑rotate or thrust the pelvis, creating hyperextension and then rapid flexion under high volume. A healthier map is to drop the pelvis (which elongates the spine), move the rib cage forward, and create lateral bend primarily in the upper ribs and thoracic spine while rotating. The upper ribs are designed to flex, extend, and laterally bend; the lumbar spine is not designed for large rotations or lateral bends. Use spiral mechanics where the upper ribs lead and the pelvis supports under you with a controlled swivel so the pivot lives in the T‑spine/C‑spine, not the L‑spine. This distributes load and leans toward injury prevention while still allowing speed. Individual differences exist, but this pattern is generally the safer, more sustainable way to move.", "question_start": 2774.52, "question_end": 2792.48, "answer_start": 2800.16, "answer_end": 3621.44, "window_start": 4.64, "window_end": 3694.559, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:04:41.697819"}
