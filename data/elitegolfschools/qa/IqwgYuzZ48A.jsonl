What are clear indicators that I’m in the correct hitter pattern or going down the wrong path, and how similar is a hitter pattern to a baseball swing?", "answer": "We define shallowing by the shoulder-axis-to-shaft relationship (check it at P2 and again at P6), not by where the club’s center of mass goes. Swinger vs. hitter for us is about how the trunk/pelvis map with the arms/hands. Swinger: arms/hands are the primary rotators to square the face; lead arm lowers and externally rotates, lead hand supinates; chest tends to back up, pelvis goes up/forward, trail foot pronates/banks; head often points back at impact (C‑spine/T‑spine rotating away). Hitter: chest rotation is the primary squaring force; arms move more across the chest (abduction/adduction), pelvis stays dropped/in flexion; chest keeps moving forward through impact. Good ball-striking exists on both ends; the key is matching arms and body. Indicators you’re on track: your impact picture consistently matches the chosen map (e.g., swinger signs above vs. hitter signs above) and ball flight is predictable; wrong path shows up when arms and trunk intentions fight each other (e.g., trying to rotate chest hard while also using a heavy hand-roll closer, or pushing pelvis forward while needing the chest to keep moving).", "question_start": 88.64, "question_end": 114.08, "answer_start": 123.2, "answer_end": 569.2, "window_start": 0.16, "window_end": 3650.119, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:17.273356"}

What’s the correct direction and sequence for the weight shift and ribcage, and what should I feel/visualize?", "answer": "Sequence: ribcage starts the backswing (P1 to ~P2.5), then its spiral loading tows the pelvis into rotation. From ~P2.5 to P4, drop the pelvis (feel like your butt goes straight down in a squat rack—knees don’t shove forward). As you drop, pressure moves into the lead foot (opposite your midline); don’t actively shove left or you’ll early-extend. After the drop, swivel the pelvis so you transition from lead bend to trail bend (bend lives between the scaps, not dumped into the low back). Keep arms/hands calm during drop→swivel; then motor the chest forward to strike. Feels/visuals: squat-rack drop into the heels, then a calm swivel that moves you from lead bend to trail bend, then go; think “drop, then swivel, then hit.”", "question_start": 1229.76, "question_end": 1237.6, "answer_start": 1247.12, "answer_end": 1591.76, "window_start": 0.16, "window_end": 3650.119, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:17.273479"}

Bottom-out should be post‑impact: enter sand before the ball while still descending, bottom out after the ball, then exit. Let the clubhead unload early as the ribcage moves forward; avoid hinge‑and‑hold or blocking the load—use the bounce. Trail wrist pattern: ulnar/dev (club down) then flexion while the ribcage shifts laterally forward (a small lateral lunge), minimal intentional rotation in the strike. Adjusting for sand: fluffy sand = shallower AOA and a big “U” shape (more chest‑driven, wide); dense/packed sand = steeper AOA and more “V” (slightly pick up and re-deliver down). Expect the ball to come out hotter/faster from firm sand; you don’t need much effort.

Slight dominance can follow your handedness, but it’s more like 49/51 than 0/100. The goal is efficient tissue loading/unloading with the arms supporting the chest’s motion. Think sledgehammer: both arms and hands hit while the pelvis supports the ribcage; chasing a one‑arm feel usually creates mapping errors (e.g., excessive trail arm IR/pronation or lead arm over‑rotation to square). If impact looks off, fix the map (how you square the face and drive the chest) rather than assigning one arm to dominate.", "question_start": 2189.84, "question_end": 2198.72, "answer_start": 2198.72, "answer_end": 2472.8, "window_start": 0.16, "window_end": 3650.119, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:17.273676"}

Thoughts on shallowing and why it affects keeping posture?", "answer": "Shallowing is a spectrum and must match the body. Coach the hit first (P5–P7+): decide your desired face rotation, chest motion, and health constraints at impact. Then shape transition to support that hit; finally, tidy setup. Backswing shape matters far less than delivery. Loss of posture happens when arm and trunk intentions don’t match (e.g., too much hand roll with a chest‑rotation hit, or handle/depth patterns your body can’t support). Define the impact you want, then build just enough shallowing to match it so the pelvis can stay dropped and the butt can stay back.", "question_start": 2648.4, "question_end": 2657.28, "answer_start": 2665.6, "answer_end": 2874.24, "window_start": 0.16, "window_end": 3650.119, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:17.273764"}

The pelvis is more open at impact, and the way you square the face is different. Avoid making “knuckles down” (lead hand supination + flexion) your closer; it forces trail‑arm pronation/throw, can back the handle up, and is unstable/injury‑prone. Preferred pattern: lead wrist more flexed by P6, then moving toward extension through and after impact while the chest keeps turning forward—like keeping a ping‑pong paddle stable through the hit. A key picture: the hub (middle of the grip) can arc sharply left while the clubhead’s center of mass still travels out to the right (block‑draw). Stable, chest‑driven release with flex‑to‑extend wrist behavior produces a much more reliable strike than a heavy hand‑roll.", "question_start": 2912.8, "question_end": 2921.44, "answer_start": 2929.8, "answer_end": 3315.2, "window_start": 0.16, "window_end": 3650.119, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:17.273863"}

That shifts the path slightly left and biases a squeeze‑cut with a modestly downward AOA—good for fairways/hybrids. You’re not trying to hit down with the arms; the chest shape delivers a shallow, pinchy strike, and taking a thin divot with fairways/hybrids is common. You can play it well forward if you own the chest/pelvis shape; just avoid backing up the pelvis or throwing the club to add up‑attack artificially.", "question_start": 3332.64, "question_end": 3340.56, "answer_start": 3340.56, "answer_end": 3531.68, "window_start": 0.16, "window_end": 3650.119, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:03:17.273955"}
