How can I get my lower body more open at impact?", "answer": "Stop trying to rip the hips open. When the pelvis aggressively opens while the ribcage and arms counter-rotate or side-bend to slot the club, tissues fight each other and the pelvis rebounds (stalls), the face flashes, and the low point gets messy. Instead, keep the pelvis under the trunk and let openness be a byproduct of a better matchup: shallow and organize the club/arms so ribcage and pelvis turn in the same direction, without shoving the pelvis forward or chasing max rotation. Align tissue directions; rotate with the ribcage as the engine and the pelvis supporting, not leading.", "question_start": 109.52, "question_end": 119.32, "answer_start": 128.8, "answer_end": 455.52, "window_start": 0.16, "window_end": 3714.1189999999997, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:06:05.904742"}

Don’t drive the hips forward/up or try to spin them open early. Two main hit maps: if you want an across-chest, more transverse hit, you must drop the pelvis to tilt the chest toward the ball, then turn. The lead leg firms as a result of pelvic rotation and ribcage-driven turn, not by actively locking it. Practice: to the top, feel pelvis drop under you, let the chest find the ball, then turn and swing the arms across your chest; let the lead leg straighten as a reaction to rotation, not a push.", "question_start": 463.4, "question_end": 490.08, "answer_start": 499.08, "answer_end": 938.76, "window_start": 0.16, "window_end": 3714.1189999999997, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:06:05.904860"}

Is the drop simply moving into posterior pelvic tilt?", "answer": "Use a mild posterior pelvic tilt at address (belt buckle slightly up) with thoracic flexion from scapular protraction. In transition, the combination of the pelvis dropping and the arms elevating extends the spine globally; through impact you return toward flexion, and you extend again into the finish.

Arm-to-height ratio mostly affects club length and lie, not your address spine tilt or the need to shallow/drop.

Preferred map: start with a neutral grip. Backswing: trail wrist extends and pronates to strengthen/set the face. Transition: keep trail-wrist extension and add supination while you shallow/turn.

It’s a response to the body motion, not a standalone move, and you must keep turning—don’t freeze the body or overcook the shaft.

For a systematic approach, do a GOATA Recode with a certified GOATA coach (they work virtually); you’ll retrain gait/locomotion patterns so your tissue loads/unloads harmoniously, which raises your ceiling for implementing the swing.

Are you focusing on the right hip rotating toward the target or the left hip rotating back? At P5 should I push down on my right leg and hit into a posted left leg, or shift entirely left and hit over it? Any feels you use?", "answer": "The ribcage is the engine; the pelvis and legs support via the spiral line. In transition, drop the pelvis so the pelvis stays under the trunk; the lead femur is pulled into internal rotation and the trail heel is thrown away (out), then land and make a pelvic swivel to move from lead lateral bend to trail lateral bend while the ribcage turns. The kneecap orientation stays stable for a moment while the femur is pulled internal—don’t actively drive the knees or externally rotate them. The left-leg \"post\" happens from rotation and the vertical component of the ribcage turn, not from jumping or actively pushing off the right; force plates will show pressure changes, but think rotate and unload spiral tissue rather than push.
