You compare Dustin Johnson and Collin Morikawa. I'm more like Collin. How do I get that feel back?", "answer": "Wrist set depends on grip. With a stronger lead-hand grip, set mostly with radial deviation while keeping the lead wrist more extended; the face will already be stronger. If you want a flexed lead wrist look (DJ-style), you generally need a neutral to slightly weak lead-hand grip so flexion doesn’t over-shut the face. Match your release to the set: flexion tends to release into extension; a radial set tends to release with more supination. Balance grip, set, and release so the face stays manageable. If you strengthened the grip a lot, favor more radial set and less flexion.", "question_start": 295.04, "question_end": 321.28, "answer_start": 330.96, "answer_end": 600.8, "window_start": 2.96, "window_end": 3711.3599999999997, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:59:32.910612"}

Any guidance on basic driver concepts to focus on? I also carry a 3-hybrid—how should I set up hybrids compared to irons?", "answer": "Hybrids: Generally set up and swing them like irons. If your hybrid is more wood-like (bigger crown/CG back and low), you may flight it better with a slight pinch (a bit more downward strike). If it’s more iron-like (flatter crown/CG more forward), a sweepier strike works. Driver: You don’t have to hit up; plenty of great players hit slightly down. Prioritize geometry—at setup get some arm extension out from the chest, then in transition slot the club and keep the pelvis more under you so you can send the club out, creating a long flat spot. With driver, feel more “out” than “down.” If needed, CG/weighting can tune launch and spin (forward CG lowers launch/spin; back CG raises both).", "question_start": 1140.96, "question_end": 1159.04, "answer_start": 1159.04, "answer_end": 1673.76, "window_start": 2.96, "window_end": 3711.3599999999997, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:59:32.910829"}
