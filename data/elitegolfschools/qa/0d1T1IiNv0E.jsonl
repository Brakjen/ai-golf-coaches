Use more torso and pelvic rotation, then lift the lead arm via shoulder flexion rather than forcing it across your chest (adduction). Get the chest turning toward ~90 degrees and keep turning the rib cage and pelvis as you lift the arm—this frees the geometry so the arm can get to and beyond parallel without strain. Do awareness reps: from a good setup, rotate the rib cage and pelvis a lot, then lift the lead arm and keep turning both segments into the top so you’re rotated and the arm is up. Avoid trying to run the arm too far across the chest; rotate more and flex the shoulder to create room.", "question_start": 116.8, "question_end": 125.52, "answer_start": 125.52, "answer_end": 452.16, "window_start": 2.8, "window_end": 3730.4, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:58:58.331099"}

Start with feet together, hover the club, then go small step with the trail foot, turn the chest to sling the arms back like relaxed pool noodles, and step the lead foot as the body keeps rotating. Rhythm: one-two-three. The chest leads (proximal-to-distal), the arms respond, and you land pressure into the lead side as the midline keeps rotating.

I move too far laterally right in the backswing and don’t recover to my lead side.", "answer": "Weight is vertical (you feel lighter when dropping and heavier when rising). Pressure is where that force is under your feet (north/south/east/west). Favor a figure‑8 pressure pattern: trigger pressure into the trail forefoot/toes, as the upper spiral continues it curves back into the trail heel, then as you drop the pelvis it shifts to the lead forefoot (ball), and with rotation it fish‑hooks back toward the lead heel. Practice by hovering the club and tracing that figure‑8 with your feet and chest rotation—avoid a pure lateral slide.

My handle lifts late—what causes it and how can I fix it?", "answer": "A rising or thrown handle is usually from pelvis thrust and/or spine extension to make space (often from standing too close/heel‑loaded). Instead, keep the clubhead deeper behind you into delivery so you can keep turning your chest. As you rotate, the handle should naturally work left while the clubhead moves right—think handle left via rotation, not by yanking it around. Maintain posture, don’t shove the pelvis toward the ball, and ensure you have enough space at address.

Some say very light, others firm. Does a low vs. high rate of closure change what you recommend?", "answer": "Use as much pressure as you need to control the club at your speed—faster swings require more pressure; putter is lightest. Grip pressure is dynamic and will change throughout the swing and between hands (you’ll feel it migrate across the palms/carpals). Don’t squeeze so hard that you lose range of motion and feel, but the “tube of toothpaste/baby bird” cues are too soft for full‑speed shots. Grip strength also matters—lower grip strength typically limits swing speed. Prioritize speed control and retention; the exact release pattern is less important than holding on securely without over‑tensioning.", "question_start": 1561.04, "question_end": 1577.04, "answer_start": 1577.04, "answer_end": 1843.36, "window_start": 2.8, "window_end": 3730.4, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:58:58.331488"}

Why, and how do I fix it?", "answer": "Uphill lies often play into the grain and the leading edge can catch. Many players also present the heel first, which digs. Bias the toe and use the bounce: set the face slightly more open with the toe down so the toe‑side bounce (not the leading edge) meets the turf. That reduces digging and lets you be steep without chunking. Understand the parts: leading edge cuts, sole is the flat underside, bounce is the rearward camber that ‘glides.’ Present more bounce (especially toe‑side) to glide through sticky turf. It’s also fine at times to use the leading edge for drivey shots, but choose which part of the sole engages based on the lie.", "question_start": 1852.0, "question_end": 1867.68, "answer_start": 1877.44, "answer_end": 2163.68, "window_start": 2.8, "window_end": 3730.4, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:58:58.331592"}

Many players align slightly left, start the ball left of their alignment, and rotate—face left of target with path even farther left. Earlier instruction often described push cuts (aim left, swing down the line). Examples of modern pull cutters include Johnson, Koepka, and Hovland.

Keep the face square to the path by rotating around the upper thoracic (roughly T5) rather than trying to keep it square to the target with lateral bend. Short putts can be mostly distal (hands/forearms) for precise pressure; as the putt gets longer, layer in elbows, then shoulders/torso. Prioritize pace control: you want a ‘marshmallow’ feel of the ball staying on the face and a consistent roll about 17 inches past the hole. Too firm shrinks effective hole size and demands perfect line.

My big miss is fat. Any advice?", "answer": "Use the latitude‑longitude drill: halfway back the shaft sits on a horizontal (latitude) feel, and halfway down it’s on a vertical (longitude) feel. Being laid off isn’t automatically bad (e.g., Berger, Rahm, Garcia). If you’re laid off, pull the arms down as you turn and it can match up easily. Keep your personal quirks that work.

How is that possible?", "answer": "Own the strike at the bottom. Intentionally vary contact and AOA to develop control: if you shank one, purposely hit the next off the toe (even beyond the grooves) to feel the other extreme; if you hit it fat, hit the next one slightly thin; if you’re too picky with low point, increase downward AOA.
