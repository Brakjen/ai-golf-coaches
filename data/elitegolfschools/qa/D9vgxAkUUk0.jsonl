If I have a steep AoA, does it mean I'm steep at P5 and have less face stability? I tend to pull the club down from the top and get high, spinny shots.", "answer": "Shallow shaft at P5 and shallow AoA are not the same. Many golfers who deliver the shaft steep actually compensate by adding a lot of right‑side bend and stalling rotation, which makes AoA too shallow and moves the low point back. The better matchup is to actively shallow the club (move the center of mass behind you via supination/internal rotation) while driving the ribs/chest forward in transition. Blend “psycho shallow” club with “psycho steep” ribs to get a neutral, penetrating strike. Drill: place a dowel centered between your feet and try to take meaty divots on the target side while rotating and moving your chest forward—your descent will feel shallow but the bottom will be forward. Expect to feel like you move your ribs/head forward a lot; on video it will be far less.", "question_start": 88.76, "question_end": 115.28, "answer_start": 123.6, "answer_end": 443.84, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 1925.279, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:01:15.569784"}

Any drills or suggestions to fix this?", "answer": "‘Handle drag’ is almost always an illusion caused by the pelvis shoving forward, excessive right‑side bend, and scapular retraction of the lead arm (a bad chicken wing). Fix the body, not the hands. In transition, swivel the pelvis so the lead side ribs expand, then keep moving the ribcage away from the ball while you rotate. Keep the lead humerus internally rotated relative to the ribs as you turn—don’t externally rotate to ‘release’ it. That spiral (pelvic swivel → ribs move away) lets you shallow the club, keep the chest turning, and send energy out with stable arms, eliminating early extension, blocks, and flip‑hooks. Rehearse in a mirror: delivery position, small pelvic swivel, feel lead ribs expand, then keep the ribs moving away from the ball through impact.", "question_start": 451.88, "question_end": 470.56, "answer_start": 479.28, "answer_end": 807.96, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 1925.279, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:01:15.569923"}

Should I move to a DJ‑style early set or keep grinding on the takeaway?", "answer": "Don’t chase a perfect takeaway. Build from the ball back: impact dynamics first, then transition, then setup, and last the backswing. Choose your takeaway/hinge based on what you need through transition. If you need a more shut face and a deeper club through delivery, bias an early set/shut look (a DJ‑style feel) and keep the system a bit taller so transition is easy. If you need it more open/over, allow more rotation/fanning early. Use feels that are caricatures of what you want dynamically; static P‑positions won’t hold once you go full speed.", "question_start": 807.96, "question_end": 843.84, "answer_start": 843.84, "answer_end": 1164.48, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 1925.279, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:01:15.570006"}

How does that square with the idea of hitting through the shot with the humerus bones?", "answer": "Yes—the hub (hands) traces up and in through impact because the hub is the pivot and the clubhead is being slung outward, like a dual‑lever catapult. When you send the club out, the butt end naturally moves back toward you and away from the target as an effect, and hand speed peaks around P5–P6 then slows as the club accelerates. Don’t consciously tug the handle in; that kills speed. Turn the body, unload the club, and ‘hit through’ with the humeri by continuing rotation while letting angular momentum release the club—the handle’s up‑and‑in motion will happen on its own.", "question_start": 1174.48, "question_end": 1193.2, "answer_start": 1193.2, "answer_end": 1564.4, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 1925.279, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:01:15.570090"}

Pattern 1 (radial–ulnar with forearm roll): backswing loads radial deviation, then you unload to ulnar while using external rotation/supination to square. Arms lower, pelvis tends to shove forward, chest rotation stalls, and you square it more with the forearms. Pattern 2 (trail‑hand pronation → extension, then supination → flexion): you shut the face earlier, extend the trail wrist, then rotate the body and the face squares from rotation; the release is extension to flexion as you keep turning. Both can work; choose your blend based on speed, body, and ball‑flight needs, and make sure the body matchups support the hand/wrist pattern.", "question_start": 1583.92, "question_end": 1600.48, "answer_start": 1600.48, "answer_end": 1882.08, "window_start": 0.32, "window_end": 1925.279, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:01:15.570177"}
