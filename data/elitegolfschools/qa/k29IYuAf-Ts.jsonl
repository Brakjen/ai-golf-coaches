Keep stance and face square and adjust path, or keep your stock path and adjust stance and/or face?", "answer": "Use small pivot and delivery adjustments rather than rolling or holding the hands. Change the pressure/energy direction of the pivot to influence path (slightly right for block-draw, slightly left for pull-cut) while keeping a stable release. Face controls start line; curvature comes from path relative to face (e.g., pull-cut: face a little left, path further left). Avoid big pronation/supination changes because they wildly change loft and height. Delivery depth helps: for a block-draw, get the club deeper at P5–P6 and send pressure to the right; for a pull-cut, club not as deep and send pressure left. This keeps launch and spin more consistent while giving you tight, repeatable curves.", "question_start": 154.8, "question_end": 181.76, "answer_start": 189.92, "answer_end": 850.64, "window_start": 2.879, "window_end": 3505.0, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:00:12.997087"}

How do they achieve that?", "answer": "Launch is player dependent and tied to ball speed optimization. Higher ball speed typically optimizes with lower launch and less spin; lower ball speed needs higher launch and more spin. Apex targets are roughly around 95–105 ft for many players. Dynamics that lower launch: more forward/\"bowed\" trunk, a later unload (less dynamic loft at impact), and a slightly more downward AOA. To raise launch: earlier unload (adds dynamic loft) and a more upward AOA. Keep the face stable via body shape; then adjust AOA and unload timing to tune launch and spin for your speed.", "question_start": 883.2, "question_end": 891.92, "answer_start": 891.92, "answer_end": 1452.08, "window_start": 2.879, "window_end": 3505.0, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:00:12.997183"}

How do I achieve that while moving the chest laterally? When I try it, I feel like I’m falling back.", "answer": "The trail-bend/look-back at impact is a response to force direction, not a pose to hold. As the arms and club fire forward, the ribcage counter-moves away to keep balance, producing right lateral bend and keeping the head behind the ball. With more speed (driver), you’ll see more of this; with wedges, less. Feel a \"chest pass\": send the arms/club forward while the ribcage subtly counters back, staying in back-chain dominance.

I’ve been hinging more upward for wedges and more sideways for longer clubs.", "answer": "Don’t change the wrist model by club in full swings. Release needs are driven by your grip and body dynamics. The main full-swing difference is when you unload the club: earlier with driver (adds dynamic loft and shallows AOA for higher launch, lower spin), later with wedges/short irons (reduces dynamic loft and tends to increase spin). Short game/finesse shots are a different technique, but for full swings keep a consistent release model and vary the timing of the unload and body shape.", "question_start": 1870.0, "question_end": 1879.2, "answer_start": 1888.0, "answer_end": 2147.2, "window_start": 2.879, "window_end": 3505.0, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:00:12.997366"}

Pair your turn with ‘unders’—trail scap down/in and shallow the club as you turn. If you simply drop the arms, you’ll often steepen or stall. Use an under-spiral with turn so the club shallows (trail scap works down/in), then rotate.

What makes a swing appear more or less compact?", "answer": "Two big factors: 1) Midline control—good players keep the arms in front of the body’s midline, adducting at the top just enough to load the posterior arm line, then recentering through and after impact. Arms that run off midline look long and loose. 2) Tensegrity—great swings alternate relaxation (so tissues can lengthen/load during transition) with timely tension (to unload into the ball).

Thoughts?", "answer": "Differentiate bends: avoid left bend from the lumbar spine (pelvic tilt), which steepens the shaft.

Feel upper ribs on one side compress as the other side expands, keeping the bend high (T-spine/C-spine). 2) Kneeling (toes together, sitting on heels), same sliding of the shoulder axis.
