I'm hitting big draws/hooks and some fat shots with a low point behind the ball. How do I drop the pelvis while shifting forward without moving the low point back?", "answer": "Use the pelvis to support the chest so the arms can fire out of the chest. From about P3 to the top, drop pressure down the lead leg (not just shift left) as the arms finish. Then swivel the pelvis so there’s room for the rib cage to move forward. Pelvis and rib cage move in opposition: if you shove the pelvis forward, the rib cage tilts back and the low point stays behind (fat shots). Instead, drop, then swivel while getting the rib cage forward so your trunk faces more targetward at delivery. Now you can turn and launch the arms out of the chest, making the arc go down–ball–down–bottom out–up with a forward low point. A good feel: big belt‑loop separation on the swivel and the head/chest moving slightly forward as the belt loops move back.", "question_start": 110.0, "question_end": 126.48, "answer_start": 142.72, "answer_end": 681.04, "window_start": 0.0, "window_end": 3696.32, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:01:38.678861"}

Is the drop actually happening?", "answer": "It’s happening but looks seamless. The drop and swivel are tightly blended in good swings. Styles differ: Rory continues turning as he drops (club gets deeper, handle stays in), which biases an easy draw. Hovland drops while starting to rotate forward sooner (handle more out), which biases a pull‑cut. If you’re over‑cutting or need later shallowing, add more Rory‑style drop‑while‑turning; if you’re over‑drawing, add some Hovland‑style drop‑then‑rotate.

Can you expand on the psycho deep part?", "answer": "Psycho deep is heavy coronal‑plane shallowing (negative alpha force) paired with rotation. Actively send the club down your coronal plane while rotating the chest; angular momentum from the turn then shoots the club out. At slow speed you’ll see the head stay on the trail side as you turn; at real speed, rotation forces it out, so face control still comes from your turn, not a flip.

Exceptions: 1) No room—OB/penalty tight on both sides or a crossing hazard you can’t carry, so you must lay back. 2) Short par‑4 with a front pin guarded by a front bunker where a 30–50 yard pitch won’t stop; lay back to a full wedge instead.

Stay dropped while you turn, keep the club deep with more abduction and some internal rotation in transition so you can fire out of the chest. Don’t shove the pelvis forward and early‑roll the arms; that moves the bottom back. Think sledgehammer into a brick wall: level the tool, then send the head.

Ball about 2 inches forward of the sternum with slight forward shaft lean that matches loft so dynamic loft is near zero while the putter ascends a couple degrees—this launches the ball slightly up with immediate forward roll. Grip more in the lifelines and stand the shaft taller to reduce face opening/closing and keep the path tighter to the target.
