What should point at the target versus left or right? Also, how do you decide if ball position is too far back or forward? I know the sternum is low point—how should we think about this at setup?", "answer": "You don’t need perfect, textbook alignment—set up to match the shot you want. For a stock cut: feet can be near the target, and progressively aim the knees/hips/ribs/shoulders slightly left so the shoulder axis is left. For a draw: let the shoulder axis work slightly right. Ball position pairs with this: farther back tends to create a more inside path; farther forward tends to catch the ball on a leftward path. That’s why most tour players cut driver (ball forward) but may draw irons (ball more neutral/back). For a cutter, the chest/shoulder axis more left moves the midline forward, so the ball usually creeps up. For a drawer, a shoulder axis a bit right tends to move the ball slightly back. Build your dynamics first, then use alignment and ball position to bias start line and curvature.", "question_start": 195.04, "question_end": 231.2, "answer_start": 231.2, "answer_end": 505.6, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3851.84, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:55:30.711823"}

Keep the upper arms quiet early—don’t shove the lead arm across and confuse scap movement with rib rotation.

If the arms stay quiet relative to the chest, the hands live in a small ‘basketball’ in front of you. When you start lifting/adducting, the hub (where the hands hold the grip) can travel in-then-over while the clubhead stays under.

The risky pattern is pelvis rotating and drifting toward the ball/target, which forces a counter-rotation and side bend from the lumbar to square the club. Instead, by P4 the pelvis COM can be slightly target-side, then in transition rotate the pelvis away from the ball and target (back and out) so the rib cage can rotate toward the target.
