When I try it, I hit shots both right and left before I straighten out. I've been a hitter at the ball and I like the Adam Scott grip. How can I build more consistency?", "answer": "Match your grip to the release you want, then keep your body motion consistent. With a weaker lead hand (lead arm more external/supinated), you’ll need lead‑wrist flexion (bow) at the top to square the face, then you can add more lead‑arm external rotation through impact (think Morikawa). With a stronger, more pronated/\"internal\" grip (Rory/Fitzpatrick style), you’ll hinge more radially going back and release more ulnarly while keeping the lead arm more internal through impact. Don’t overhaul your pelvis/rib mechanics for either pattern—build the grip around the hit you want, not the other way around, as long as the grip isn’t extreme.", "question_start": 127.84, "question_end": 168.0, "answer_start": 175.92, "answer_end": 370.56, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3352.081, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:57:03.583006"}

Should those stay consistent throughout the bag, or are they six‑iron specific?", "answer": "Those were example numbers for a stable block‑draw pattern, not a universal target. AOA tends to stay similar, but face‑to‑path changes across the bag. Ball position on the swing arc is a big driver: with irons (low point forward), you’ll more often meet the ball on the in‑to‑out part of the arc and can draw it; with driver (ball forward), many good players see leftward paths and hit cuts. Keep your qualitative map (movement intent) consistent and expect quantitative numbers to change with ball position, shaft, and energy.

Is there a release pattern that can work with this?", "answer": "You don’t need a lot of active lead‑wrist extension to strike it well. Prioritize the structure of the upper arms relative to the ribcage and keep the ribs rotating through impact. If extension is limited, allow more forearm supination/\"throw\" through the bottom (think Jon Rahm) while maintaining upper‑arm‑to‑rib structure and avoiding a big pelvic thrust/spine tilt.

If your intent is to drop the arms hard, your body will tend to extend to counter that. To reduce early extension, keep the pelvis in flexion, rotate the ribs, and direct force out of the chest through the strike instead of dumping the arms down.", "question_start": 957.28, "question_end": 966.64, "answer_start": 966.64, "answer_end": 1080.8, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3352.081, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:57:03.583256"}

Fix me.", "answer": "You’re likely extending the spine to lift the handle in the backswing, which makes you spin out. You don’t need a longer arm line to hit it far—build a big rib rotation with a short arm swing (think Finau/Rahm), then add force in the same direction rather than lifting.

Sequence: pressure to the trail side as the ball migrates target‑ward, then spiral the torso to sling the arms while the pelvis drops and rotates. Get most of your rotation by P3 with quiet arms, then adduct and flex the lead arm as the pelvis and ribs reverse—this loads the lead posterior arm line. Avoid letting the arms run off early.

Keep the upper arms structured in front of the chest. For a sagittal‑plane club release, keep the trail wrist extended through impact and then move it into flexion while rotating the chest; that sends the club back up in front of you.

When I try to fix it, I hit pushes. Any ideas?", "answer": "If the face matches a rightward path, you’ll push it. Don’t chase zeros—tiny degree changes are negligible and often hurt playability. Build a consistent curvature (e.g., a playable driver cut) and aim for it. Check the grip first—avoid an overly strong trail hand, and keep it more neutral/pronated to stabilize the face.

Is that a weight/pressure shift problem?", "answer": "Fat is often an intent and geometry issue. If you drop without changing your hit intention, you’ll bottom out behind.

What does that indicate?", "answer": "You’re likely moving into early lumbar extension plus lateral bend (front‑chain dominance), compressing space in the low back. Stay in back‑chain dominance: keep the glutes dropped, ribs in front of the pelvis, sacrum back, and rotate both hip and shoulder axes together.
