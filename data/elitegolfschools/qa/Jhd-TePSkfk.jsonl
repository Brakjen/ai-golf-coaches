My 30-40 yard shots launch too high and fall short; I want an apex under 12 feet. What lies are best for this shot?", "answer": "For a low spinner, maximize spin loft while keeping launch low: expose plenty of dynamic loft at impact but pair it with a downward angle of attack. Hitting down lowers launch; hitting up with lots of loft balloons the ball and reduces spin. Think high dynamic loft plus a descending strike with the bottoming-out point forward. With wedges we want low launch and high spin, not driver-like high launch/low spin. Keep the club moving down through impact while the face shows loft; avoid adding upward attack with lots of loft. If you do it right, you will see launch under about 30 degrees with high spin.", "question_start": 80.64, "question_end": 98.2, "answer_start": 98.2, "answer_end": 403.6, "window_start": 5.6, "window_end": 1841.84, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:24.445389"}

Can I set the grip from a delivery-like arm/elbow structure?", "answer": "At address, lightly protract both shoulder blades so the upper arms sit in front of the ribcage (anterior). That protraction makes the lead elbow/antecubital naturally point more toward the target without cranking the humerus. Keep the humerus neutral and adjust the grip by pronating/supinating the forearm, not by twisting the upper arm. A neutral grip: glove logo roughly 45 degrees out, and the thumb-index V pointing toward the trail clavicle/shoulder. Too much external or internal bias contorts the arm line and adds unnecessary tension. Use scapular protraction to set the elbow orientation, then place the grip neutrally.", "question_start": 431.68, "question_end": 449.68, "answer_start": 449.68, "answer_end": 757.36, "window_start": 5.6, "window_end": 1841.84, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:24.445489"}

Mine lift too high and it hurts delivery. Should the arms match the shoulder plane?", "answer": "The lead arm’s backswing position is a blend of three shoulder actions: flexion (lift), adduction (across), and internal rotation. Good players use some of each. From a turned chest, add lead-shoulder flexion and adduction; the trail arm lifts mostly passively as the lead arm moves, with some passive internal rotation to plane the shaft. If you are under-plane, add more flexion or reduce internal rotation; if you are over-plane, add adduction or get more chest turn to deepen the handle. As a rough guide, think balanced portions of flexion, adduction, and internal rotation rather than matching only the shoulder plane.", "question_start": 766.4, "question_end": 791.28, "answer_start": 791.28, "answer_end": 1051.76, "window_start": 5.6, "window_end": 1841.84, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:24.445588"}

Marry that with body rotation so it looks like a golf swing; all good players shallow the shaft from early backswing into delivery (the shaft’s plane narrows relative to the shoulder line). You square primarily with rotation, not by throwing the hands. The feel can come from different places—trail-hand supination and lead-arm rotation options, lead-humerus rotation, scapular depression/protraction, side bend, and pelvic motion—all helping the club keep lowering on that plane before it finally shoots out on the sagittal plane through release. Do not try to lower then turn as separate steps; load, then rotate as it continues down the coronal plane.", "question_start": 1070.48, "question_end": 1085.24, "answer_start": 1085.24, "answer_end": 1523.04, "window_start": 5.6, "window_end": 1841.84, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:24.445699"}

Why?", "answer": "Longer clubs require more out in the out-and-down release vector. With wedges (steeper shaft), you can lean more into the down component; with driver (flatter shaft), bias the out component. Get the club sufficiently deep so you can send it out, and as you do, rotate and move the ribs/pelvis away from the ball to counterbalance—this lets the energy go out rather than down. Driver also benefits from more shallowing in delivery; if you stay on top and hit down, you will tend to block or push. Match the release to the club’s geometry: more down for short irons, more out for long clubs and driver.", "question_start": 1588.88, "question_end": 1605.36, "answer_start": 1605.36, "answer_end": 1755.84, "window_start": 5.6, "window_end": 1841.84, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:02:24.445777"}
