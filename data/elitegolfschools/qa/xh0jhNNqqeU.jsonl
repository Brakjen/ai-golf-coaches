Does it start with the club shallowing followed by rotation? Please explain the timing relative to club position.", "answer": "Think of two phases. Transition 1 (P2 to roughly P4): the lead arm adducts and lifts while you keep rotating and drop the pelvis. Transition 2: the pelvis and chest swivel as you slot the club down the coronal plane to about P5. Keep hip flexion so your chest “owns” the ball and orient your lower‑rib transverse plane toward the ball; organize the club on that plane, then run the arms out of your chest. Same map for wedge vs 3‑wood—only the overall shape/tilt differs. This produces face stability whether you release early or late.", "question_start": 555.96, "question_end": 565.32, "answer_start": 574.6, "answer_end": 961.56, "window_start": 0.28, "window_end": 3616.521, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:05:10.765085"}

Common errors and optimal method?", "answer": "Prefer an early set with trail‑wrist extension in the takeaway. It strengthens the face and prevents yanking the handle down to load late. For slower speeds, a more radial hinge (toe up) can work; for higher speeds, a stronger face (more trail‑wrist extension/bow) helps. Depth is often overrated—avoid excessive lead‑arm adduction and trail‑scap retraction that pin the trail arm behind you. Let torso rotation create most of the depth, blend modest adduction with shoulder flexion, and keep the handle in front of the chest. At P4, hands can be over the trail heel with the handle still in front; the club may be back, but the arm structure stays in front so you can turn and keep the face organized.", "question_start": 972.28, "question_end": 988.92, "answer_start": 999.0, "answer_end": 1363.68, "window_start": 0.28, "window_end": 3616.521, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:05:10.765191"}

Is it flush contact from slower rotation/holding angles, or a flush half‑swing chippy shot?", "answer": "A “thumper” is an efficient ball flight for your ball speed—launch and spin matched so the ball apexes about 90–95 ft on full swings (roughly 8‑iron through driver) and lands predictably. Higher ball speeds can use lower launch/spin; lower ball speeds need more launch/spin.

Across‑the‑line often comes from too much lead‑arm adduction and trail‑scap retraction, pushing the handle deep and forcing scap elevation/slide/tilt to finish. Remedy: set the trail wrist early (handle slightly toward the lead side early), and make the lead arm the lifter while you keep turning.

Avoid anterior‑chain extension where the pelvis thrusts toward the target and the chest drifts back—this disrupts bottom‑out and forces compensations.

How do you keep the sternum behind the ball if shaft lean and the butt line move the sternum over the ball?", "answer": "Two different views. Face‑on (for roll): play the ball ~2 inches forward of the sternum, and use slight shaft lean with about 2–2.5° actual loft. Return with small dynamic loft and a slight upward AOA (e.g., +1°) to create negative spin‑loft—ball elevates slightly and immediately tumbles forward, rolling true regardless of grain. Down‑the‑line (for start line): keep lumbar tall, round the thoracic so the thoracic plane is roughly perpendicular to the shaft plane and eyes level; this keeps the face stable to your path whether you use more hands or more thoracic. “Sternum behind the ball” (face‑on ascend) and “butt through the middle of the back” (down‑the‑line geometry) can coexist—they address different planes.", "question_start": 2216.96, "question_end": 2244.44, "answer_start": 2252.76, "answer_end": 2765.84, "window_start": 0.28, "window_end": 3616.521, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:05:10.765499"}

A practical fix is drop, then pivot from the trail hip so the club stays out in front instead of crashing in.

Upper ribs accordion; use the “boat” drill to feel it. Move right with left bend; move left with right bend. Do it seated to take the pelvis out so it’s truly thoracic.
