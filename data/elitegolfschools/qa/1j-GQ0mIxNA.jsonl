Is it created by turning the ribs to move the handle away, then a gentle arm lift, and if I leave the lead arm as I drop does that load the posterior arm line? Am I on the right track?", "answer": "Yes, you’re on the right track. Sequence it proximal-to-distal with the ribcage initiating. Use the ribcage/spiral to create posterior trail and anterior lead arm-line load on the away move (handle goes away, not up). As the arms fire back and the pelvis drops then swivels, you trade into posterior lead and anterior trail arm-line load. The point of loading is to unload: organize in the middle, then let the arm lines release through. Keep the handle moving away while you drop and swivel so the club can ‘float’ and the rhythm stays calm between away and through.", "question_start": 161.12, "question_end": 187.36, "answer_start": 187.36, "answer_end": 460.32, "window_start": 0.08, "window_end": 3438.319, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:57:50.713155"}

Too much across traps the trail elbow behind you (stuck), forcing an out-and-around recovery. With a steeper lead arm the handle stays in front, then body turn lets the arms swing across without getting stuck, making face control and exit easier. Hand depth is overrated; many great players were steep.

Is it more lead-hand pull or trail-hand push, and how do trail elbow, wrist, and fingers unload into the shaft?", "answer": "Avoid hyperextending the trail elbow and pronating through impact. With driver, deliver more on the out vector the shaft is built for. Use the trail elbow as a pivot while the trail wrist goes from extension toward flexion (a ‘reverse bow’ feel) so the club delivers from a more ‘under’ shape, not over-the-top. Send energy out early in the correct direction. Support that with the body: pelvis and ribcage stay away as you rotate so you can sling the club out safely.

Should I actively try to do this?", "answer": "No. That look is a byproduct of sending energy out and the lead side moving away. Lead-foot supination occurs from inversion plus internal femur rotation as you turn and pressure shifts back into the heel. Some players ‘jump’ more and the foot lifts/rolls, but you shouldn’t try to jump; it often kills turn and forces hand-flip face control.

Increase pressure down each leg line (e.g., 90/10) without shoving the pelvis laterally. Hinge into the balls of the feet, then in transition drop the pelvis, then swivel to trade spiral lines. As the lead side spirals away, the ribcage and pelvis move up/back/away while you keep space from the ball (chair drill: don’t touch the chair).

Why would wedges blade when my irons are dialed?", "answer": "With wedges, the down intention comes from pelvis and ribcage, not by dropping the arms. Point your chest’s transverse plane more down the target line in transition (drop pelvis, orient ribs) so you can send the club ‘out of the chest’ on a downward vector and set the low point forward.

If only in transition, when do they switch?", "answer": "The centers trade during transition. With lower-energy shots (wedges), after the drop-and-swivel you can keep the pelvis more under while the chest turns and stay in that relationship through impact. With higher-energy shots (driver), the spiral adds more right bend and pulls on the right hip so the pelvis center moves more targetward and you extend earlier, while the ribcage is being pulled up/back/away.

How do you structure the woo in the forward swing?", "answer": "Woo 1 is ribs.

Use the upper-rib spiral (accordion effect): expand upper ribs on one side while the other side approximates, so you get the needed side-bend while the ribcage COM moves the opposite direction.
