The motion is curved and rotational. From the top, let the rib cage open and move laterally while the upper spiral line under the lead armpit pulls up, back, and away as the club shallows.

Is this a good idea?", "answer": "Yes. A good pattern is slight pronation with extension in the trail wrist to strengthen the face while you spin the shaft. That puts the lead wrist more into flexion. You can add radial, but prefer turning, spinning the shaft up, then shallowing in transition and turning through. Feel: turn, spin the shaft up, shallow, turn, hit.", "question_start": 463.52, "question_end": 474.88, "answer_start": 474.88, "answer_end": 591.28, "window_start": 15.065, "window_end": 1649.92, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:56:41.297587"}

Favor inversion/supination on the outer edge with the inside ankle bone up, paired with internal femur rotation. This matches natural crawl/walk patterns: ribs move toward the lead side as the pelvis moves away. Avoid banking on the instep or pushing off the toes—those drive adduction and a pelvis thrust, forcing compensations and making slotting and low-point/face control harder.", "question_start": 607.44, "question_end": 616.64, "answer_start": 616.64, "answer_end": 860.16, "window_start": 15.065, "window_end": 1649.92, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:56:41.297644"}

Move the rib cage toward the lead side while depressing the trail scap to create right lateral bend in the T- and C-spine. That opens space between the trail humerus and ribs so the upper arm can move without pinning it. Avoid tilting the ribs to the trail side and dumping motion into the lumbar.

Avoid dragging the handle (anterior line) that makes the transition messy. Many players set it by about P2–P2.5. Practical feel: turn, spin the shaft up to strengthen the face, then in transition lift the lead arm, keep turning, add trail wrist supination/trail arm internal rotation, and then fire.", "question_start": 1242.32, "question_end": 1252.72, "answer_start": 1252.72, "answer_end": 1414.64, "window_start": 15.065, "window_end": 1649.92, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:56:41.297799"}

I might be overcooking it into the ground.", "answer": "You can overcook it if the arms act early (supination/extension/adduction) without the body, or if you just tilt. The club should move down the coronal plane while the spine engine is working: ribs toward lead side, pelvis away, in a crawl pattern.
