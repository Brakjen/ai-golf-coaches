It feels like my trail shoulder/scap is pulling, not my chest sending the trail arm back. Do you have a drill to feel the correct movement?", "answer": "You’re likely loading the anterior arm line (scap retraction, like starting a lawnmower) instead of the posterior arm line plus spiral line. We want scap protraction as the ribs rotate away. Drill: stand at a corner with your trail hand on the wall, keep the hand on the wall (it can glide up a bit) and rotate your rib cage away from the hand—don’t cheat by just spinning the pelvis. You should feel the scap wrap around the ribs (protract) as the posterior arm line loads with the spiral line from lead hip to trail armpit. A Frisbee throw is the same feel: load posterior arm line, then in transition let it trade into anterior arm line through the hit. Avoid loading anterior arm line early, or it will immediately unload and you’ll lose time to organize the club.", "question_start": 294.8, "question_end": 311.8, "answer_start": 311.8, "answer_end": 668.12, "window_start": 0.919, "window_end": 3482.481, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:05:42.025824"}

How would you address these restrictions in a lesson?", "answer": "Yes. You don’t need big flexibility; you need movements that match your available ranges and your pattern (e.g., swinger vs hitter). Avoid one-size-fits-all tips—every action must be married to a compatible body pivot. Example: a handle-lowering/lag move tends to pair with a pelvis-up, less-turning pivot; a more across-the-chest arm path needs more chest turn. Precision and speed come from blending an arm-club map with a matching pivot while protecting tissue health. Work within your constraints, choose compatible pairings, and organize the motion so you can create speed and control without forcing range you don’t own.", "question_start": 677.36, "question_end": 694.0, "answer_start": 702.68, "answer_end": 1014.84, "window_start": 0.919, "window_end": 3482.481, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:05:42.025953"}

I’m focusing on keeping my hips back and not early extending, but the wrists still break. Is this sequencing?", "answer": "Most often the pelvis is driving too far forward. To match that, the body has to dump wrist angles with a lot of shoulder extension and trail-arm internal rotation to square the club—this looks flippy. Fix: make the trail hip the pivot in the downswing. Let the pelvis drop and swivel away from the target while the chest can move forward. Then hit with the arms across the chest (abduction/adduction) instead of a down-hit. With pelvis dropping/away and rib cage forward, the right arm can pass across the left with better dynamic loft and a forward low point, reducing the flip.", "question_start": 1023.76, "question_end": 1041.4, "answer_start": 1049.08, "answer_end": 1259.68, "window_start": 0.919, "window_end": 3482.481, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T11:05:42.026059"}

I struggle to keep the chest moving; the face closes quickly and exits high.", "answer": "Two levers: distal (club) and proximal (pivot). Distal: by P6, a fade wants the clubhead slightly outside the hands (more on top). A draw wants it deeper (inside the hands). Proximal: keep the pivot largely stable, then send a small rib-cage “energy wave” left (fade) or right (draw). For a fade, feel a slightly leftward energy wave while keeping the club more on top at P6; for a draw, deeper club at P6 with a slight rightward wave.

I get a bit steeper when I try that. How do I avoid getting steep while achieving a low-left exit?", "answer": "Don’t force low-left with shoulder over-spiral (elevate/protract) or with lead-scap retraction plus external rotation—both are hacks. Low-left should be a byproduct of angular forces and rotation. Get the club deeper in delivery (lower, more behind you) via a good drop and organization, then rotate the chest. The club will unload around the trunk and exit lower-left on its own. If the club is high/in front, you’ll have to tilt to keep it on plane and it exits high.

Can you reconcile this?", "answer": "Hip extension is good when it’s a passive result of driving the upper spiral line, not an active pelvic thrust. Backswing: elongate lead hip to trail armpit (spiral), then drop to load posterior spiral. Downswing: swivel from lead-lateral bend to trail-lateral bend and drive the spiral line through the hit and all the way to finish. As you actively drive the ribs/spiral, the trail hip gets pulled into extension passively, which supports the arms longer. Bad extension is active lead-hip–driven thrust that forces tilt, wrecks the low point, and spikes face rotation.

The spiral line pulls the rib cage away from the ball in the backswing and through-swing, so the center-of-pressure trace moves away in the backswing, shifts in transition, and works away again through impact—an “away, back, away” look. Keep pressure on the outer edges of both feet (last three toes), avoid banking onto the instep/big toe, which shoves the pelvis forward and adds excessive lateral motion. Keeping pressure on the outside edges helps keep the pelvis under you so you can turn and support the strike.

Keep the pelvis quiet and under you. Unload the club with the hands while turning the chest forward—this gives you a reliable forward low point and clean strike. Avoid the old open-stance/ball-back/handle-forward pattern that relies on pelvic extension and produces thin/chunky hits. For higher shots, add loft (open the face and set it properly), drop the trail foot slightly back, rotate more open with the chest still moving forward, and keep unloading the club.
