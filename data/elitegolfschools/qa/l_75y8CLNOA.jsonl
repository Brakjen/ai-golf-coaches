Active release = you actively move the club down the coronal plane (for a right‑hander: to the trail side) via forearm supination/internal rotation/negative alpha. Passive/Angular release = your body turn flings the club out perpendicular to your axis. Blend both: as your chest turns, run the club down the coronal plane and then actively “send” the clubhead around you with the arms and hands (tetherball feel). Don’t just drag the handle; you’re still firing the arms and hands through impact. Practice: turn the chest to place the club on the coronal plane, then continue turning while you actively send the head. Same map for driver, irons, and wedges; with the driver you can feel a slight earlier ‘tetherball’ send as you keep turning.", "question_start": 152.8, "question_end": 162.08, "answer_start": 162.08, "answer_end": 410.32, "window_start": 0.0, "window_end": 3194.0, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:59:48.113404"}

Keep that plane intact in transition rather than breaking the chain. Instead of forcing the trail humerus to internally rotate, drive transition proximally: pelvic drop and ribcage spiral under the lead armpit (ribs move from anterior to posterior). That ribs‑led move passively adducts and internally rotates the trail humerus, laying the club down while preserving Orion’s Belt. Drills: “Mime mode” hands on an imaginary wall—move ribs into the trail humerus, then into the lead humerus without the hands sliding. From the top: backswing, then ribs right‑to‑left (for a right‑hander), let the club float, then fire. The float happens because you’re trading load from trail posterior arm line to lead posterior arm line via the ribs.", "question_start": 457.28, "question_end": 473.84, "answer_start": 473.84, "answer_end": 911.84, "window_start": 0.0, "window_end": 3194.0, "source": "livestream", "model": "gpt-5", "prompt_version": "v1", "extracted_at": "2026-01-08T10:59:48.113539"}

How should I load?", "answer": "Load is tissue expansion, not contraction. Think myofascial spiral line expansion: in the away swing you lengthen tissue; in transition you drop the pelvis to expand the posterior chain (glute max, hamstrings) and load glute med/min so the femur moves into internal rotation. Don’t try to ‘turn on’ a glute by squeezing it—elongate it. Feel a slight rise in the away swing, then a pelvic drop to expand and load the right side (for a right‑hander).

Any suggestions to accommodate this?", "answer": "Avoid shoving the knees forward and loading the patellar tendon. In transition, drop the pelvis back (belt buckle moves away from the ball) so the posterior chain takes the load (glutes/hamstrings) instead of the patellar tendon. Keep pressure more toward the heels as you drop, not toward the toes. Also avoid excessive trail‑foot banking; stay more on the outer edge to distribute load along the spiral line.

Is the ‘lead‑leg rainbow’ (Kyle Berkshire) usable?", "answer": "For most players, don’t actively jump. Let lead‑leg extension emerge from proper rotation. From P4, drop so the lead knee gains flexion and pressure shifts into the lead heel as the midline turns away. Keep rotating the pelvis up, back, and away; that rotation naturally straightens (posts) the lead leg without a push. Actively jumping tends to stall rotation, promote early extension, risk hyperextending the knee, and force timing with the hands.

I push my arms too far away when I try this.", "answer": "DJ’s distal‑first push (pronation/extension) can send the hands out; it works for him, but most should go proximal‑to‑distal. Start the takeaway with the chest/ribs (upper spiral) so the trail elbow stays more in front (anterior) as the lead arm lifts, then let the hands set.

I have no idea how to play them.", "answer": "Use your pitching technique with precise low‑point control. For shorter blasts you can change carry by changing loft (60 through 8‑iron) with the same explosion motion, but 60–70 yards often needs a ball‑first strike like a fairway pitch. Backswing: lead arm goes across as the ribs/head go down and forward. Downswing: head/ribs go up and forward while the club unloads, with the sternum well forward so bottom‑out is ahead of the ball. In bunkers the divot still starts behind the ball on explosions, but for longer yardages you shift that start point forward while keeping the low point forward.

Start slightly toe‑biased (ball of foot) by hinging from the hips so the arms can hang with space. That gives you room to drop in transition.

That curved path moves you away from the ball and target while you turn.
