Watch your lower-body action: rotate in flexion, move pressure with the trunk. Trail elbow: don’t chase a bent trail elbow.

It’s fine for the head and chest to move forward; give yourself space to move into. Drill: make swings where you move off it in the backswing, then back on with the rib cage in transition—stay in hip flexion and rotate. For the arms/wrists: allow the arms to ‘drop’ via shoulder extension while the trail wrist supinates and the lead wrist has slight flexion with ulnar deviation to keep the face stable.

Use a light kettlebell and train rib-cage-to-upper-arm rhythm: let the upper arms trail the ribs as you rock/rotate, avoid early trail-scap retraction, and learn gentle spiral-line lengthening.

How can I bias toward a more horizontal or more vertical swing plane?", "answer": "Think in terms of sending the club ‘out of your chest’ while keeping your joints away from the ball so the handle can release outward. With wedges the chest is more down, so the ‘out’ vector is more downward; with longer clubs the chest is more level, so the ‘out’ is more horizontal.
