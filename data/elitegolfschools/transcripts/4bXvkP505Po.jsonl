{"chunk": "a great ebook I'll put it in the video description so people can look at it perfect that's excellent but Kendall's absolutely phenomenal and one of the main reasons that I love Kendall so much", "start": 43.92, "duration": 20.1}
{"chunk": "is that he makes things Dynamic right and a lot of these medicine ball throw exercises that we're about ready to explain and show", "start": 53.28, "duration": 16.758000000000003}

{"chunk": "again put it here yeah it doesn't work as well um first let's just show a couple of throws I'll stand over here and you can just Huck it at me don't throw it too", "start": 70.14, "duration": 16.499000000000002}
{"chunk": "hard I'm fragile okay um but throw one of the the basic ones good now as you're doing this just explain a bit on what you're feeling all", "start": 78.119, "duration": 18.861}
{"chunk": "right so kind of two separate systems here the arms are kind of doing their thing they sling up okay the mid lines while the chest is rotating yep okay so", "start": 89.4, "duration": 19.741}
{"chunk": "arms are swinging up as I'm rotating I'm going to let this ball fall underneath me okay as I'm doing so you kind of see", "start": 99.42, "duration": 16.38}

{"chunk": "see in space right this is a vertical action it's just like the hands are going straight up yep vertical so if I turn over here and I let my arm swing", "start": 148.98, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "straight up vertical fair enough that's what the hand path does is it all things up yep now the club head is on a different curve and we show some", "start": 159.18, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "internal action and there's some stuff that goes on in the wrist and so the club head itself and the shaft might look a little bit different okay but as far as training with the hands", "start": 168.48, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "really really cool look and notice again like go ahead and set up teach ing lets the ball hang underneath him for a lot of players they'll hold it out", "start": 177.319, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "here for whatever friggin reason that's not it say the arms aren't hanging you want dead weight underneath yeah and a really cool exercise too teach go ahead", "start": 186.3, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "and face the camera now okay and what I want you to do is just move the rib system laterally and let", "start": 194.519, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "the the arms just follow the rib system there you go and instead of as much Bend just show more lateral movement in the ribs", "start": 201.78, "duration": 16.92}

{"chunk": "shoving the arms around so TJ isn't shoving the arms back here nope to do that see how now the ball is off my midline yep yep exactly so that's lead", "start": 219.659, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "Norm abduction right so we're moving it see that the arms are responsive to the ribs so", "start": 228.18, "duration": 17.5}

{"chunk": "that action the heaviness of the ball it like floats up here and starts to fall back over the other way yep and as it falls then you start to learn now as it", "start": 244.739, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "once it starts to fall I can respond to shoot it off the other way yeah instead of like probably a common Bugaboo would be", "start": 254.099, "duration": 15.301}
{"chunk": "yep right so if you do that with something that heavy you're just going to throw it in the ground yeah it ain't gonna feel very good either no it's not there you go go ahead and toss a couple", "start": 261.9, "duration": 18.02}
{"chunk": "more to me okay beautiful the other cool thing like as TJ does this you'll be able to notice it the ball does not spin and it comes out", "start": 270.6, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "at the same level that he starts here that's hit me in the knees that's because it's about where he's starting here okay so it's not like throw one up", "start": 280.68, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "here way more extension to get that up here interesting okay yep so you can do variables on this so if I wanted to", "start": 288.3, "duration": 16.699}
{"chunk": "throw one and bounce pass to you got it okay this would be low because it's just going to skip but now to do that I'm going to stay like in more hip flexion", "start": 299.28, "duration": 16.258}
{"chunk": "to be able to do that because yeah look see how your ribs like they respond forward into shooting down so that could be like flattening it Down Right would", "start": 307.199, "duration": 18.561999999999998}
{"chunk": "be a little bit of a bounce pass here yep exactly what a great way to do it see how you stay in hip flexion for longer do a little hip flexion that's a great way to do it so like a common one", "start": 316.86, "duration": 18.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "that uh you might see is is this spin on the ball through impact right and that would come more or less yeah from that extension pattern yep and the natural", "start": 325.5, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "kind of hand motion from there is exactly so show a bad one okay lots of extension lots of throw so much", "start": 335.28, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "spin yep exactly and that's a high balloony floaty cut or a big old dark hook", "start": 343.259, "duration": 17.058999999999997}
{"chunk": "guest okay sometimes you can get it yes flash it I'm running that out yep exactly but even starting with this like this is a good good angle to see this", "start": 351.139, "duration": 16.301000000000002}
{"chunk": "I'll do it right at you teach sure so I'm going up catch it now if I just turned over here and toss it now I can feel the arms swing again up the midline", "start": 359.759, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "on the other side so they're up here and that looks really similar to what a golf swing would be so you could kind of teach yourself this drop and swivel", "start": 369.06, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "action first yep yep exactly okay and you can even fake it out to where I'm going okay drop", "start": 377.94, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "turn are my midline's over here arms swing up see how the ball didn't spin at all if I just stood and let the arms fold over that's the finished position", "start": 385.62, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "got it so there's so many variables that you can teach yourself yeah in these fun little actions okay one of the ones that", "start": 393.96, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "you just talked about was drop yes okay so let me see the ball actually so if I've got the ball up here swing", "start": 401.4, "duration": 20.497999999999998}
{"chunk": "drop swing drop as it's dropping if I want it to drop more or if or for longer see now I'm dropping with like it's way", "start": 410.639, "duration": 18.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "less now I caught it so instead of just it's not weightless for long right here weightless that is dual hip flexion to", "start": 423.78, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "drop so like you'll see my rump work away and down yes and that's the that's the gather as Kendall would talk about", "start": 432.6, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "but for us it's the it's the preservation of time in transition so P3 to P5 that's when you're going to start", "start": 441.78, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "to drop you'll see our favorite athletes start to drop in map phase so even as the golf club's finishing its action up to the top they're going to be dropping", "start": 450.419, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "during that phase yes it'd be dropping as he's going into flexion of the hips", "start": 458.34, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "yep you can do that in a lot of ways so if I'm in here and I'm going turn now get the get the arms kind of putting energy into the ball as it goes up now I", "start": 469.259, "duration": 19.56}
{"chunk": "can fall with it fall with it fall with it and notice how I'm like tossing it like letting it actually go so I'm letting the weight of gravity or the", "start": 478.319, "duration": 20.88}
{"chunk": "momentum of gravity go so I can just learn oh I can drop in here once I drop I think kennel calls it the heavy Point", "start": 488.58, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "as I drop and catch it this would be the heavy Point again that's when I know I can toss it to the other side but not until you reach the heavy point right if", "start": 497.88, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "you're really trying to train this yep and what's important with the heavy point is if I've got it here and it's dropping dropping heavy Point that's not", "start": 506.099, "duration": 19.8}
{"chunk": "impact no it's got a q u six piece like P5 P6 somewhere in here so now as I start to go sacrum and turn boom there's impact and through impact got it and", "start": 515.219, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "that's why I like to build on a previous concept once you drop here that's the heavy point this lead shoulder working up back and Away clears all the room", "start": 525.12, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "exactly for this club to shoot out and shoots it out yep so show that one we call this pump okay okay so show two pumps and then once you feel that heavy", "start": 533.399, "duration": 19.141}
{"chunk": "point then you can just turn and toss it at me so you're up pump pump now I could toss there you go so now you", "start": 543.12, "duration": 20.28}
{"chunk": "start to feel this like boom oh wow so you're tossing after the heavy Point yep exactly if you wanted to do it", "start": 552.72, "duration": 19.099}
{"chunk": "even better to preserve even more time uh interesting so that's kind of I'm not gonna lie that's like I've played around with this", "start": 561.6, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "field of golf club in my hand a bunch recently yep it feels like you're tossing it up waiting for it catching it and going", "start": 579.3, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "that one that really feels like that I mean obviously you're not going to toss it with a darn Golf Club but let's feel the same amount of energy", "start": 587.339, "duration": 17.101}
{"chunk": "yep it's so good it's so good it's awesome because when you see it like really I mean", "start": 595.74, "duration": 16.359}
{"chunk": "it almost looks overdone sure but honestly it looks so good because it you have so much time in here to organize", "start": 609.959, "duration": 19.821}
{"chunk": "see ya and that one still had what amount of energy on it do you feel like if that's 100 cap where were you at 60 somewhere in there to be honest the ball", "start": 619.7, "duration": 19.479}
{"chunk": "is gonna go probably at least 90 percent of whatever full is yeah right like that was eight iron super efficient yeah so we're in Colorado cellular and goes 100", "start": 629.64, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "yards yeah but like typically eight iron's like what 165 175 carbs somewhere around there yeah so like let's call it 170 if it goes 90 of it you're in like a", "start": 638.64, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "150 155 range I guarantee that ball one at least that yeah for sure right so it's not actually 60 it feels like", "start": 646.98, "duration": 15.539}
{"chunk": "that's an important thing like it it feels like you're not working very hard exactly but that's efficiency our preferred pattern is such a late hit yep", "start": 655.019, "duration": 19.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "agreed that okay give us time from P3 to P5 I don't want to I want to get it back here because I need this everybody knows that this needs to get back onto the", "start": 664.38, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "golf ball so I need it down here I need it down okay well that's an arm action hit pattern got it okay whereas our", "start": 673.38, "duration": 16.381}
{"chunk": "preferred pattern is it's on my right side I'm just gonna turn to get it into the ball boom so this already is late because it's like it should be on the", "start": 681.72, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "ball it's not on the ball oh well there it went no it's on the ball yeah rather than got it on the ball yeah so there's like two things that we're battling that", "start": 690.3, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "rotational hip mechanism okay okay and number two from up here we're just dropping and not doing anything with it yeah not I don't need to no there's", "start": 698.88, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "nothing so it's like floaty so this takes time already floaty and then once it gets in delivery wait even longer yeah yeah it feels like", "start": 708.54, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "everything happens like nothing's happening one there's everything yeah and then even then it's like okay", "start": 718.079, "duration": 15.681}
{"chunk": "it's like yeah you never want me to hit it exactly that's exactly what we're talking about right compared to the old pattern of like fire this down yeah this", "start": 725.66, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "is a hit now yeah get it back on the ball again is there one way to skin a cat no no definitely not multiple different ways to do it and what we're", "start": 733.86, "duration": 15.299}
{"chunk": "talking about right now like there's a couple of kids down in Arizona that we've actually talked to in our full-time Academy about you need to", "start": 741.779, "duration": 19.86}
{"chunk": "actively feel lead arm adduction active and Lead shoulder extension get it down here because they've just overcooked", "start": 751.079, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "dropped turn the arms never do anything this is unhittable as well yeah like yeah not much good this has to be", "start": 760.079, "duration": 15.581}
{"chunk": "down at some point right so so there are a few different ways that you can do that according to what you need to feel personally in your pattern based on", "start": 768.899, "duration": 17.581}
{"chunk": "everybody's individual system got it but 95 out of 100 people we see too much of this doesn't mean that those five don't", "start": 777.839, "duration": 16.860999999999997}
{"chunk": "exist right but exactly yeah exactly so yeah it's just knowing the matchups again that's why we like talking in systems systems approach is going to", "start": 786.3, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "help so so much so we talk a lot about I even hate this term now because everybody hates it shallowing okay got it it's not it's not necessarily", "start": 794.579, "duration": 16.981}
{"chunk": "shallowing it's just getting the golf club in a position at the end of the load phase which is P5 so this from P1 to P5", "start": 804.12, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "is all I load phase positioning the golf club into an area and the forces that I'm putting on it that strain the golf club", "start": 812.88, "duration": 17.278999999999996}
{"chunk": "strain my Satchel line strain muscles so that loads it's like I'm expanding that whole system to a point now that when I", "start": 821.82, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "rotate it wants to shoot the golf club out because of angular Force so that's the whole point is feeling this fully", "start": 830.279, "duration": 15.661000000000001}
{"chunk": "stretched out load into delivery yep right and the reason that stupid term shallowing happens okay set", "start": 837.6, "duration": 15.659999999999998}
{"chunk": "up again is because where the center mass of the club or the balance point of the club it rides up on top in the backswing and", "start": 846.42, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "then it moves over here and we need the instrument to move over here because it stresses the instrument stresses the", "start": 854.279, "duration": 15.419}
{"chunk": "body so that now I'm loaded as a mug so if I just let this go TJ start turning it just shoots it out", "start": 861.959, "duration": 16.282}
{"chunk": "like it is allowed to go this way because as I rotate this way boom it's just like it stresses the whole system for long got it so when that when the", "start": 870.26, "duration": 17.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "club is is stressed behind in this fashion generally as you're rotating the chest it just wants to sling into the ball that's angular force and that's a", "start": 879.0, "duration": 16.261000000000003}
{"chunk": "stable pattern angular happens because of rotation in the chest the club's back here and it shoots out now let's contrast that maybe to a load pattern", "start": 887.16, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "that happens a little early right in the backswing and now that's the exactly snap yeah", "start": 895.74, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "yeah so what what TJ's talking about is if we go back to setup generally okay okay and we go up here anywhere like let's say the club's swung up on top of", "start": 902.82, "duration": 17.218}
{"chunk": "it okay but if TJ puts energy in the arms down so it show that shoulder extension yeah that leaks to the", "start": 911.339, "duration": 15.302}
{"chunk": "um the humerus working in external rotation so now the club the center mass of the club is working outside so this", "start": 919.62, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "is the active like look of rotating this see how close it is and outside the line it is so if you just kept going", "start": 927.12, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "it'd be kind of a way to to release the club but you're going to feel like for most systems you're going to feel like you work really hard and get", "start": 935.519, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "nothing out of it because you're never stressing systems at all sure and and to create room the arms are going down so I've got to create room by going up", "start": 943.56, "duration": 17.939}
{"chunk": "understood Yep this extension pattern hip extension leaks into spine extension these are anti-rotational movements got it that make the golf club now flash", "start": 951.959, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "okay are there guys out there that do that sure Vijay Singh does that Phil Mickelson does that they're really good players great players right but I think", "start": 961.32, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "if we're looking to build golfers which players that are novice or younger Juniors wouldn't it be nice to create a system where the face doesn't have to", "start": 970.8, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "flash as much that would be kind of nice so let's build that in yeah okay so if you can imagine like when I'm holding this ball", "start": 979.68, "duration": 16.019000000000002}
{"chunk": "right here sure that the shaft would be straight up and down yeah I'll just kind of beautiful perfect okay so if I did this just in the hands it's not a stable", "start": 987.66, "duration": 18.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "movement at all and we've talked about this in like other videos like the Orion's Belt video will help showcase this but the center of mass should stay", "start": 996.839, "duration": 15.541}

{"chunk": "there all the way okay or I could do it ideally just in the ribs there you go but now the ribs are what", "start": 1025.1, "duration": 16.138}
{"chunk": "make this whole movement happen now look at what happens go ahead and do that again when you do that watch what the center of mass of the club does", "start": 1033.439, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "it goes over here which is what we want now this doesn't necessarily look like golf swing yet because we haven't turned so let's go ahead and set up just turn", "start": 1041.0, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "over towards the camera and keep your feet there good now show ribs look at what the center of mass just did it's beautiful so now we've moved the", "start": 1049.58, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "center of mass over here based on what the ribs are doing to to line up the forces so now if you turn the chest the center of mass would", "start": 1059.12, "duration": 18.54}

{"chunk": "good now feel it in the ribs and then shoot it ribs excellent nice right in my bag but that's it like if you slow that", "start": 1077.24, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "video down and we put a tracer just on the center of mass of the club we'd see it go behind you a bit and then out yep so shallowing looks all sexy and this is", "start": 1086.6, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "this term and there's a lot of guys out there that will like argue shallowing and you're more than welcome to like you don't have to shallow it but what you're", "start": 1095.9, "duration": 18.718000000000004}
{"chunk": "seeing like if somebody doesn't shallow the center of mass of the club you're going to definitely see earlier shoulder extension and earlier external rotation of the lead arm because now what that", "start": 1105.679, "duration": 18.122}
{"chunk": "does is it keeps the center of mass of the club up on top of the plane so the shoulder extension there's external rotation of", "start": 1114.74, "duration": 16.14}

{"chunk": "here and feeling ribs and then now out that's a cool look yeah yeah so now like you can see different pictures but I'm", "start": 1131.84, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "doing that does it leak into the into the arms and the hands sure but the picture is I'm just going to left in right then extend the ribs right so if I", "start": 1140.12, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
