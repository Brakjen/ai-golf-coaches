{"chunk": "many different ways to influence a golf ball for sure. Right. Um, and obviously if you want to hit one that's like blinker mode that gets up apex and like", "start": 10.0, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "goes across the freaking horizon. Y, there's a way to do that and it's nice and helpful at times, right? But I mean really, if we're being honest, we just", "start": 17.92, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "want the ball to like almost apex and then follow the other, right? So, let let's do this. Why don't you", "start": 26.64, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "just hit one kind of stock for us here? Okay. And then I'd love to hear from you like how you're influencing the golf", "start": 38.96, "duration": 17.001}
{"chunk": "ball when we when we get into that time. Like we want to follow it left, want to follow it right. We'll just kind of jam here, see what we come up with. So, let's just hit us a stock one here, man.", "start": 47.76, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "Okay. And you were talking like before we started rolling here that most of the time when we hitting shot that was so straight by the way. That was pretty", "start": 55.84, "duration": 15.160000000000002}
{"chunk": "straight. When you're playing like we're always like having the golf ball kind of fall off to the right. Like how are you doing that man? So, for me I I've really", "start": 71.6, "duration": 15.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "just got really good at my hands. Okay. Um, I've I've weakened my grip just to try to I've got pretty big hands, so I", "start": 79.439, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "kind of feel with a little bit weaker just for me. So, I'm trying to do things to not let the club face rotate. Gotcha. And you're saying like lead hand? Yeah,", "start": 87.04, "duration": 15.681}
{"chunk": "lead hands. Just a little bit. I'm more I guess maybe more neutral. I'm about two two to two and a half knuckles on the lead hand. Sure. Um, for me, I'm not", "start": 94.64, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "very good at rotating my my my trunk through or my my rib cage through. So, it's a lot of like feels of holding and", "start": 102.56, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "setup type of stuff when I need to move the ball. Yeah, I like it when it's on, but when it's not, it's like, you know, it's just one shot. I've got one shot,", "start": 110.32, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "you know, kind of eliminated and nailed it down to one miss, but sure, even then, like that wipey kind of ball right", "start": 119.28, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "not. And I think what's cool, like, if you just hold up that left left hand, we'll just kind of face the camera here. So what Sean's talking about like we have all these weird sayings to qualify", "start": 127.28, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "like oh it's weak like who the heck came up with that right exactly. So if we want to get sciency we've got pronation and we've got supernation right and the", "start": 136.48, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "important thing is like that's just down here in the forearms. Yeah. We're not talking humorous because the language for that is more internal and external", "start": 145.04, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "rotation. But when when Sean's saying weaker, he's saying that the the lead forearm or the lead wrist is more in a supernation state. And the more that you", "start": 151.92, "duration": 17.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "go in a supernation state, like eventually you run out of range of motion, right? So if you were to grip it here, which is crazy weak and nobody's going to grip it all the way there,", "start": 161.36, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "right? He would eliminate any range of motion in that direction. Whereas if you grip it strong golf language, which is", "start": 170.0, "duration": 15.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "pronation, I have all this room. So what's kind of nice is like depending on what kind of shot you want to hit. Yeah. Want to draw it a little bit more. Super", "start": 177.599, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "easy way to do that just because now I have range of motion to supenate through toubles the shaft a little bit there goes the face and draw right but what's", "start": 186.879, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "awesome you just talked about a matchup this is difficult to motor for you at times right so like the grip can help influence that for sure so hit us one", "start": 194.8, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "here my man where you have that one that just kind of falls off like we've got the red target out there and then just kind of fall one into the black for us okay and just kind of show us that like", "start": 203.92, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "little bitty like weaker grip That that'll kind of help hold. Are you feeling like a little bit of a hold? Yes. Yeah. I feel like it's it it", "start": 213.76, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "doesn't it doesn't really get fully extended till out here. Okay. Yeah. So, it's like kind of wait weight and then it's allowed to go in here. So, you're", "start": 221.44, "duration": 15.118}
{"chunk": "just feeling a little firmer in here. Yeah. Exactly. Okay. Sweet. Let's see that one. So, that's one where it kind of went", "start": 229.519, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "right. Feels like it goes. Okay. Let's kind of play with this if you don't mind. that one look like. Yeah, for sure, man. Put my ideas out. Let's Let's", "start": 241.08, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "rock on some of those. So, um, here's what I'd love you to play with. All right. So, in alignment, let's say that we want the golf ball like falling back", "start": 248.959, "duration": 17.522000000000002}
{"chunk": "into the black. Okay. Right. You're still going to line at the black. Okay. Okay. Yeah. But then like go ahead and set up for us and then in delivery like", "start": 258.32, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "go ahead and swing it up to the top for me. Okay. Good. And then delivery right in here. We can have like the club like you feel out here where I'm at. Yeah.", "start": 267.28, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "Got center mass or club face. Yeah. The deeper that sucker gets, the easier it is for the golf club to path out to the right. Yep. If we're back up to the top", "start": 276.0, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "again when we work into delivery, the more on top of the plane the golf club is, the easier it is for it to path more like neutral or definitely left. Yep.", "start": 284.88, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "Okay. So, the first thing that I want you to do like let's not even do anything in like got like two parts I want to run ideas by you.", "start": 293.6, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "First deal is just in general like from back swing into delivery. Back swing into delivery. Okay. Where you can put", "start": 301.36, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "that or work that golf club through this space that influences how it's going to path through the strike. Okay. Okay. So, let's just see one where you're going to", "start": 309.6, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "line towards the black and based on where you're organizing the golf club and delivery, that's going to help the direction that we're going to send energy through the strike. Okay. So,", "start": 317.199, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "let's see this one just a little bit more on top of the plane. Okay. Okay. in that delivery space, which obviously we're going to try to get this golf ball starting left of the alignment. So, just", "start": 326.08, "duration": 21.88}
{"chunk": "see what happens. Okay. I like it. Nice. Yeah. So, we got it left, which is great. Let's hit one more. Just like that. Yeah. And I don't care the ball", "start": 335.36, "duration": 15.479999999999999}
{"chunk": "flight. If it draws, it draws. It cuts. It cuts. It cares. Nice. So both of those start left, which is great. Now we have both of them", "start": 347.52, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "starting left and then small amount of draw on both of them. Y. Okay. So here's second concept. Okay. So go ahead and hug this club. But I'd love to see it", "start": 362.16, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "like or. Okay. Okay. So if we have this big fin out here. Yeah. Let's say you're standing in a pool and the water line is", "start": 370.72, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "pretty much right on that ore. Yep. Okay. If you get into posture. All right. Now, as you turn, obviously that ore starts to get into the water, right?", "start": 379.84, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "So, now if we got in the water, you can influence where that wave of water gets thrown. Y. So, if you go back into kind of like delivery where this golf club", "start": 388.24, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "would be over here. Yep. Right. And the ores over here. Throw a wave of water at me. Okay. So, that's center field more or", "start": 396.24, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "less, right? Yep. Okay. What if I'm over here? Good. Now, notice like in your mind, did you try to do anything in your pelvis?", "start": 404.72, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "Nope. So it responds. Now it might extend a little bit earlier. Yeah, who cares, right? But it's mostly in the ribs or shoulder line where you feel", "start": 412.88, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "like you're tossing energy. So toss at me again. Okay. Toss it over at me. Toss it over at me. Uhhuh. I like that. Okay.", "start": 422.0, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "So if we're here, we're going to hit one where we're going to still start it left. So the golf club's got to be organized more on top here. Y. But then", "start": 430.96, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "from there, if we wanted to send a wave of energy, there you go. Okay. Now, let's go ahead and throw a golf ball in there. Okay. You won't hit me, but I'm going to", "start": 439.28, "duration": 19.838}
{"chunk": "stay right here. Okay. And we're going to aim at the black. Okay. And all we're doing is organizing it", "start": 448.319, "duration": 16.562}
{"chunk": "into delivery. But in your mind, you've got that ore out your right side. All that wave comes right at me. Now, you're a brave guy, dude. You're fine. You're freaking stud. Let's go. I won't even", "start": 457.52, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "blink tomorrow now. What' that ball do? It cut. Yeah. Because what's awesome like the more that I've got to send this wave over", "start": 466.56, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "here, it prevents this from extending. Like this is extension, right? So if I'm going turn but extend, how can I send water left? Like I can't send that w", "start": 477.52, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "that wave left. No energy can go over there. It's just all over here. Yeah. So even if I have it on top of the plane, this is going in here rocks back. I'm", "start": 487.039, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "still like all the energy goes over here. Yep. Doesn't match. If I've got it on top and I go, I've got to get this", "start": 494.879, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "wave left. Look at the pelvis. Yes. Hit that one again. Yeah. I like that. And the cool thing is is like once it's", "start": 501.199, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "on top, like I've got the club in here, right? And then we're going wave left. You can send the energy out of the tool. Like you can release it as hard as you", "start": 509.759, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "want this way. It's almost like you're starting it left and trying to keep it there with the release. You're not having to hold it. But it's the energy", "start": 517.919, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "that you're sending here. Okay. This is the energy direction. Yeah, man. It's all in the rib cage. So,", "start": 526.56, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "right at the black. Now, see, I'm like I was here. Yeah. I'm going to go just a step more over here. Okay. Get it on top of the plane. Wave at me. But full", "start": 535.04, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "energy release out of the club. Fully released. That's so cool. There's no way that draws. No, it did not. So, you can release it harder, harder, harder,", "start": 542.399, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "harder, lighter. I've never felt like, you know, all the way rotated through like that. That was better. Yeah. Yeah.", "start": 551.279, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "And what's nice is like even to neutral this out now, you can continue to feel this like for a player like you where it's like, you know, you're expressing", "start": 558.56, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "this like it's hard for me to rotate. Yeah. Most of the time when it's hard to rotate this, it's coming from here. Like this", "start": 568.8, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "is the fault, right? This is going out here. This has to recover. Yes. like how do I extend and rotate and like have any chance of finding the ball? Yeah. You", "start": 577.519, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "know? Yeah. Okay. So, let's see one now where in delivery, let's get the golf club. I'll stand back here again. Okay.", "start": 586.24, "duration": 16.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "Okay. And deliver it. Swing it back. Just in the back swing. Good. Now, what if delivery was here? Good. So,", "start": 594.16, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "that's more on top of the plank. Back up to the top for me. What if delivery is here? There you go. See how it's deeper? Yeah. And feel where that's at. But send", "start": 602.88, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "me that same wave of energy where I was standing before. There you go. Okay. So, let's see this ball flight here. Okay. So, I'm going to stand over here. This is still", "start": 611.279, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "the wave of energy, but just in delivery. Get that golf club deeper. Yep. Still fully released. All that", "start": 620.079, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "stuff. Wave at me. Now, that one's probably more neutral. Yeah. Feel it like Yeah, that was a different sound. The energy was", "start": 627.279, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "different down there. Exactly. Yeah. And what's cool, like you hit that and immediately the sensor is like, \"Yeah, let's do it again.\"", "start": 636.959, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "Yep. Exactly. Yeah, that was awesome. Okay, now I won't stand out in front of this one. But let's go ahead and set up. And in this in this action again, same", "start": 645.36, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "release. All of these the constant release goes out. We're never trying to hold. We're not trying to barrel it. We're just escape. Okay. Deep wave", "start": 653.6, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "right. So at me. Yep. Yep. Exactly. But it's never under to try to throw that. It's here. It's", "start": 662.64, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "still through, but this is the way the energy. Okay. Okay. Get it deep energy out. Know the direction of the wave. Beautiful. Just", "start": 671.2, "duration": 21.0}
{"chunk": "full thump mode right here. Yeah. Pure. Yeah, that sounds better. That's so good. Now we got a little tiny bit of like buffer off the left with the wind.", "start": 681.68, "duration": 18.441}
{"chunk": "So, it's like trying to hold. So, it didn't necessarily draw there. Better. Man, all of them are like through ribbwise, right? This tames out just a", "start": 694.0, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "little bit. Y, but all we're really doing is just going where can I organize that club and delivery like where is that passing through in space? Y and", "start": 702.56, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "then how where where am I sending energy with the trunk? But it's not like one is like under roll it to try to draw and the other one's not like let me hold", "start": 710.399, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "this energy so that it it never escapes to like cut it. You're still full release. Yeah. Where's delivery? Where's the wave direction?", "start": 719.6, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "That is awesome. That's super simple. That's kind of Yeah, that's easy. That's like dynamic. Yeah, for sure. And I think like Sean obviously is incredibly", "start": 728.48, "duration": 16.159000000000002}
{"chunk": "impressive with his action, like really really high level golf swing. But I mean, let's say that you're you're a guy that just typically overcuts it,", "start": 737.12, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "overcuts it, overcuts it, which you see all the time, or the opposite, right? Yeah. And guys just have a difficult a difficult time with I just can't draw", "start": 745.04, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "it. I just can't. I I I can't cut. Yeah. Well, you can. It's It's just It's not just about the hands. I mean, the hands", "start": 753.6, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "job is just release. We're just always getting energy out, escape the energy, but it's just the dynamics of where the club can be in delivery. Yeah. And then", "start": 761.839, "duration": 16.642}
{"chunk": "that energy direction like where's the wave energy going? It just helped clean up everything golf. So, really good stuff, man. Appreciate it, man. Let's", "start": 770.16, "duration": 17.839}
