{"chunk": "here it's this big like Wing you can feel like that blade right here that's part of the scapula what's so cool about the scap is it is a bone that is directly tied in", "start": 55.199, "duration": 20.642000000000003}

{"chunk": "it's like okay what do we prefer to see and what do we often see okay okay so arms up for us and some of this for", "start": 118.92, "duration": 16.019}
{"chunk": "those of you that watch a lot of our content this is going to be some review but if you lead arm adduct", "start": 127.079, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "you will load the lead posterior complex got it what that really is is scapula protraction", "start": 134.459, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "hmm so that action leaks into the scap the scap is protracting meaning it's that's bear hug mode again so that's dual adduction if we bear hug right okay", "start": 142.86, "duration": 19.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "protraction of the scaps okay anytime you Pro protract a scap you are loading the posterior arm line of either the lead", "start": 152.94, "duration": 16.981}

{"chunk": "loading this complex early in the backswing and for us our definition of backswing is like from P1 to like Max P3 and then we have transition which is", "start": 195.659, "duration": 18.6}

{"chunk": "because then through the strike it's kind of wacky okay so instead what we need to do is let's figure out how we're", "start": 223.2, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "moving the scaps throughout the entirety of of the golf swing okay so we're just going to show the uh boat drill here but", "start": 230.76, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "let's Show Boat drill improperly so this is going to be L spine stuff so nothing is going on in the scaps we're just going to move this way", "start": 238.44, "duration": 15.1}
{"chunk": "okay so we see this a lot see how it kicks out TJ's pelvis it's all on the L spine the scaps aren't really moving here meaning if I'm right here and I'm", "start": 247.379, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "just moving this yeah the scap complex isn't moving all the like pivot is in the start of the L spline like lower T", "start": 255.48, "duration": 15.42}
{"chunk": "right can be fairly unhealthy okay so let's remember elevation depression protraction retraction okay so hold that right up against your your shoulder", "start": 262.62, "duration": 17.938}
{"chunk": "complex okay okay I want you to depress the trail scap", "start": 271.919, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "there you go do that again good now protract the trails Gap there you go", "start": 280.86, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "so what you can do that's really really cool to learn this and learn like what we love to see in the boat exercise is", "start": 288.54, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "you can just hold either a PVC pipe or a golf club right off your Trail side and just move it in a circular manner so how", "start": 296.46, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "there you go and just do it instead of both shoulder complexes moving see how right here I can just move just the", "start": 304.5, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "trail there you go good good now you'll feel it playing here see how playful the shoulder complex gets", "start": 313.02, "duration": 16.519}
{"chunk": "yep that's it yep okay so what you're really educating is the uh like almost the uppermost spiral", "start": 322.8, "duration": 16.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "so if I am working up the spiral line going from lead hip complex underneath the trail", "start": 330.86, "duration": 15.94}
{"chunk": "armpit and over the trail scap to move that I'm going to have this the the scap it is going to respond", "start": 338.759, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "in elevation it's elevated there now I didn't go here going scalp elevation no but as I'm as I'm rotating using the upper spiral", "start": 348.12, "duration": 21.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "the trail scap is elevated sure now in transition we prefer to see a golf club that goes from a slightly above the plane to under the plane the way that we", "start": 358.02, "duration": 19.22}

{"chunk": "you're doing that teach go ahead and set up for uh posterior view with that right across your uh right across your shoulder complexes", "start": 378.06, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "good if we're doing this well you should feel a lot of the movement right in here in the spine there you go this is so much scap see", "start": 385.08, "duration": 17.580000000000002}
{"chunk": "the spine moves here for teach because this Gap is depressing protracting good now it would elevate a bit", "start": 393.84, "duration": 16.139}

{"chunk": "the movement is because like T and C spine is like meant to move or vertebrates we're meant to bend rotate do all this crazy stuff that's t-spine", "start": 419.16, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "and c-spine and the higher we can get with that you're just preventing preventing injury the healthier it is the higher you feel it right yeah exactly we just feel it", "start": 428.759, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "all happen here feeling it in the scaps is a way to move those bends up into the t-spine as opposed to feeling it down here in your L spine yep exactly so for", "start": 438.0, "duration": 18.779}
{"chunk": "teaching folks like actual scat movement what's going to go on throughout the entirety of like the backswing transition and through the hit", "start": 447.24, "duration": 19.561}
{"chunk": "if we're looking at the trail scap first the trail scap will elevate depress in transition and protract", "start": 456.72, "duration": 17.778}
{"chunk": "through the head got you okay can you show that yep absolutely so as you're turning it elevates now it would just depress there you go now", "start": 465.539, "duration": 18.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "would protract to go through the hip there you go there's the hit yes yes it kind of feels powerful too like", "start": 478.02, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "it feels good exactly like if you go this way that action right there is like super powerful you can feel like the the the", "start": 486.06, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "load now is late in transition because this retract like the scap is going to", "start": 495.18, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "depress it's also going to retract because I'm turning away from it so now this like my trail scap is retracted right here so I've loaded up anterior", "start": 504.24, "duration": 17.698999999999998}
{"chunk": "line so you've turned your sternum or gotten your sternum further away from this Gap it's moving here right this is moving away from it yep and that loads", "start": 512.82, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "up that that'd be anterior side of Trail complex Trail complex just by turning this way as you're yep and what's really", "start": 521.099, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "really important here too is I am not actively motoring the scap into retraction so I'm", "start": 530.459, "duration": 15.481000000000002}
{"chunk": "not doing this action this is scap retraction based on on the trail arm yep right I'm loading it because I've", "start": 538.44, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "dropped and I'm rotating here see I'm rotating my chest away yeah that that makes the scap retract but they're two different pictures in my mind sure one", "start": 546.42, "duration": 17.699}
{"chunk": "is it boom the picture is not to go here pictures to go there exactly so now you scap", "start": 555.959, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "attracted but this stuck feel is people from here they're actively Trail or Trail scapula retracting and that pulls", "start": 562.8, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "the handle in the golf club underneath the plane you see that a lot so yeah if we're here in a fairly good backswing position but then I actively", "start": 572.7, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "scap or tract except pulls the Hub or the handle too far back so right now it has nowhere to move now you don't got room to do this what do you call this", "start": 580.08, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "Feel Again well that's protraction yeah okay if it gets stuck back here you can't protract as much right you can but where the energy is going to flow is out", "start": 588.779, "duration": 16.860000000000003}
{"chunk": "this way too far to the right so that's where you see that bro I just ripped ass that's okay so so that's where you see", "start": 597.48, "duration": 15.820999999999998}
{"chunk": "that club head kicking out this way with rapid face rotation it's more the handle that we see kicking out to the right but yes but the face rotates really hard", "start": 610.2, "duration": 19.020000000000003}
{"chunk": "there you go I got you yeah yep because if we get stuck in here exactly because I've actively retracted this Gap", "start": 619.38, "duration": 15.658000000000001}
{"chunk": "when we're just calling it active because the arm I'm actively moving exactly active Yep this would be passive", "start": 627.899, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "yep exactly exactly so the nice thing is about proper Movement we want this we've talked about this before but this Trail", "start": 635.459, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "elbow we wanted to have clear Passage through here so me dropping creates that that room for that to", "start": 643.74, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "happen but also if I drop and then move my chest away from that see how this arm didn't move in space I'm not actively retracting this is stuck somebody goes I", "start": 650.7, "duration": 19.019}
{"chunk": "feel stuck it's because this this Trail elbow moves into the posterior side it's behind me rather than right now it's", "start": 660.899, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "anterior dropping if I turn a bit it's still anterior yeah if I depress oh that gets under the plane properly", "start": 668.88, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "protracting makes me hit yep yeah that's a different picture that's a different picture yeah a lot of people have that picture when they're trying to get the center of mass behind", "start": 677.54, "duration": 18.34}
{"chunk": "it this way yep exactly and they're trying to do this so and we're talking mostly about the trails Gap I mean the the lead scap almost moves just in", "start": 687.6, "duration": 18.078}
{"chunk": "opposition of it right like if I have elevated in the backswing my my Trails Gap the lead scap is going to depress", "start": 695.519, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "that's what creates lead lateral Bend gotcha so if any time that I depress my scalp if I just depress one of them I'm", "start": 704.279, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "in trail Bend Trail lateral Bend if I depress my lead I'm in lead lateral Bend but again the bend comes in the spine so if I'm up", "start": 712.14, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "here my leads Gap is in depression my trail scap is an elevation that's what creates the bend and the t-spine well now we talk about bouncing spirals", "start": 721.019, "duration": 19.081}
{"chunk": "a lot scap elevation scap depression boom it's really bouncing between those scat movements a little bit movements yeah", "start": 731.64, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "we're not really bouncing spirals are but we're bouncing scapula movement boom so if we're in elevation this is in", "start": 739.68, "duration": 18.779}
{"chunk": "depression now go depression elevation there you go so now from here heavy hit protract see ya", "start": 748.62, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "excellent yeah so just hit a little pitchy one here sure and what I want you to manage is the elevation", "start": 759.0, "duration": 15.739}
{"chunk": "depression and protraction here okay this move right here where you're feeling this hole right shoulder complex moving the", "start": 766.519, "duration": 16.141}
{"chunk": "instrument in space there you go very cool because now what's what's really nice about the scaps just from a movement", "start": 774.6, "duration": 15.879000000000001}
{"chunk": "perspective is we can see where the tool wants to move in space elevation makes it move up depression makes it go down", "start": 789.48, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "yep so now I'm above the plane under the plane got you yep and then I can hit sort of moving the instrument and space really", "start": 798.0, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "well boom beautiful and there's the hit good and then just kind of wrapping this up with anterior versus posterior arm", "start": 805.92, "duration": 16.898}
{"chunk": "line loads in the back swing go ahead and set up so we can see anterior side okay what we're looking to do early in the", "start": 820.019, "duration": 20.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "backswing okay is load the posterior Trail arm line and the anterior lead arm line yep okay", "start": 829.44, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "so let's let's have you move I'm going to keep the handle right here but move this pack what feels like underneath the trail humerus", "start": 838.62, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "there you go good so what's happened is this is stretched out this area is stretched out that would be loaded anytime we're stretching fascia we're loading fascia this is stretched as well", "start": 847.26, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "this is loaded so in essence go back to neutral we're looking to move this keep this Trail arm right where it's at", "start": 856.62, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "underneath so I'm pulling this under under yeah okay as it keeps going it'll make the make the arm lines", "start": 864.72, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "eventually move good if you really wanted to look cool just load the hand complex Trail hand complex there you go so now we've got", "start": 873.24, "duration": 17.699}

{"chunk": "the trail arm good good yeah so there's a couple of different ways to really work on the scaps you can work on them like what we", "start": 916.019, "duration": 18.22}
{"chunk": "just did with loads and most people I think feel the posterior Trail load early in the backswing so riding", "start": 927.3, "duration": 19.561}

{"chunk": "the rib complex knocking this Trail humorous out of there so if I'm set up here I have some kind of gapping here between the right ribs like where my", "start": 945.06, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "armpit is and this trail trail arm I'm just moving into that space to knock it out of there yeah boom so when you're talking like moving into the trail", "start": 952.56, "duration": 15.298000000000002}
{"chunk": "humorous that's what you're talking about so humerus right here you're moving your spiral line essentially into", "start": 961.019, "duration": 15.362}
{"chunk": "that yes exactly beautiful it loads up that posterior swings the arms up at which point passively you get your", "start": 968.1, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "sternum away from the club head it's going to load up the other side now you've loaded anterior yes so like what", "start": 977.22, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "you just did show that position in one motion so we're going to knock the right out fall back in here there you go do it again", "start": 984.6, "duration": 20.46}
{"chunk": "just smooth it out boom now smooth it out so it's bounce float good so now you're ready to hit boom so", "start": 994.92, "duration": 17.579}
{"chunk": "you just you just manage the load phase so it makes the hit easier now I can just boom boom boom boom makes it real smooth right down there makes it really", "start": 1003.92, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "easy okay so show us one where you're just feeling the load that same load where you're knocking that trail humerus out towards the camera based on that post that's beautiful and as it floats", "start": 1012.92, "duration": 18.898999999999997}
