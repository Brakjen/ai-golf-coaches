{"chunk": "freaking cool story. And, um, I I just think it's amazing. So, a a a student of ours, he's a a playing professional, very high level playing professional, uh", "start": 469.36, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "uh Chris Cordy, lived with um who now a player that now has full-time status on tour. And he would", "start": 479.52, "duration": 20.919999999999998}

{"chunk": "like, you think about this guys, in the level of precision to be able to do that is just absolutely incredible. And he would do it in one practice session,", "start": 523.599, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "just tremendous. So the point of this next question in your latest vid achieving command of the golf ball then you", "start": 532.88, "duration": 15.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "describe three levels of energy waves either ones, twos or threes and my question is what is the single primary", "start": 540.32, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "movement that you're thinking about to increase or decrease when going between energy levels? Is it something that to do a spiral stretch, woo woo pacing,", "start": 549.44, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "proximal to chest rotation speed, arm speed, etc. So great question and it's easy to go down rabbit holes right on", "start": 559.44, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "like where speed comes from and this and how to allocate energy and blah blah blah. Now part of the reason that that we", "start": 567.12, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "describe things in the ways that we do is because for a higher level players like I'll say even like intermediate", "start": 575.36, "duration": 15.92}

{"chunk": "say 95 to maybe 85 or 80, that's intermediate. If you're breaking 80, you're for sure a very accomplished player. And even if you're shooting low", "start": 593.0, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "80s, I mean, you damn good, man. So, good on you. Um, but anybody from that intermediate level all the way through to to to playing professional golf, like", "start": 603.44, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "a lot of the language that we try as hard as we can to use is just athletic concepts so that I can have this like", "start": 612.08, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "map in my mind of what the golf swing is. It's I was talking to another student the other day and it's almost like we want the golf swing to just", "start": 620.56, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "become a shape. You can't even describe it. It's just the shape of the swing, right? um", "start": 628.16, "duration": 15.438}
{"chunk": "and and you just execute on that shape. So, this goes handinhand with this. And when we're when we're commanding the the", "start": 635.279, "duration": 19.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "distance, okay, and this is also part of the reason that I'm not I'm not a massive fan of clock system when it comes to actually executing shots. It's fine to do this to go ahead and like", "start": 645.2, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "just regulate distance of swing because again, if I only swing the club back here to like P2 and then over here to", "start": 654.8, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "whatever this would be, P8, like I'm limited in how far I can hit that golf ball. Like there's I'm maxed out compared to loading the golf club all", "start": 662.56, "duration": 15.117999999999999}
{"chunk": "the way up here, load more tissue, blah blah blah. So when the the question is this, like how do I command like how far", "start": 670.079, "duration": 16.282}
{"chunk": "I'm throwing the golf ball on the green? So, for example, if I have seven iron here, and for me in Colorado, I hit", "start": 678.56, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "seven iron at my fullest probably somewhere between 185 and 190, depending on how good I feel for that day. Now,", "start": 685.76, "duration": 16.559}

{"chunk": "going to hit full gas seven iron. Um, I'm just going to hit like a softer one to just manage the trajectory and the spin rate and the apex level. Right?", "start": 703.519, "duration": 22.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "So, what we're looking to do here is we're obviously not putting as much energy in. And what I'd like you to play around with is it's almost like if I had", "start": 714.6, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "a uh a wall right here that were perpendicular to the target line and I give you a sledgehammer and I told you that the bottom brick I want you just to", "start": 723.44, "duration": 17.997999999999998}
{"chunk": "chip at. Okay? Okay. So, I don't want you to ham hawk and knock down the whole damn wall. I want you just to chip that one brick out like Jenga. So, I go here", "start": 732.639, "duration": 19.762}
{"chunk": "or up here and go boom. Now, this is the same action that I would have for a much fuller swing. But if I just go bonk and", "start": 741.76, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "tap that thing, that's obviously not going 185 yards. Like that ball right there was", "start": 750.88, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "same action as a full swing, right? And if I grip it like I normally would in a in a golf shot, same map, I mean, that's", "start": 760.56, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "120 yards in the air compared to a shot that's full rip. There's 185.", "start": 769.519, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "Now, those look similar, but it's very easy to see one has less energy than the other. So, when I'm hitting", "start": 778.519, "duration": 18.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "It's more the dexterity of the hit. What is the pressure that I'm going to put on the object that I'm hitting? In this", "start": 787.44, "duration": 15.117999999999999}
{"chunk": "case, it's a wall. In this example, I hit a golf ball. If I gave you an axe and a tree, tree shape differs, right? Like an aspen tree. Looks a heck of a", "start": 794.959, "duration": 18.082}
{"chunk": "lot different than a freaking sequoia. So, if I wanted you to chip away at an aspen tree compared to chipping away at a sequoia, dude, the hit is different.", "start": 804.16, "duration": 18.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "You have different energies in each one of those. Steph Curry freaking hit hits jumpers from everywhere, right? But he's not thinking about", "start": 814.0, "duration": 18.361}

{"chunk": "they're going to put on the ball from the object or or from the tool. That's it. Okay. So the training needs to come", "start": 847.839, "duration": 18.481}
