{"chunk": "one that you love yes yeah okay I'm off my off my mic now let's go into ball flights okay yeah", "start": 312.0, "duration": 19.8}
{"chunk": "um so why why don't you just hit us a couple shots that are fairly stock kind of low rates of energy like 70 75", "start": 322.02, "duration": 15.979}
{"chunk": "percenters okay beautiful let's do one more those hit good by the way yeah that was pretty good okay let's see if you can do", "start": 329.639, "duration": 17.9}
{"chunk": "another can you hit another one that good I think so so this is just stock out 70 75 know the system flushed out", "start": 344.28, "duration": 17.481}
{"chunk": "okay beautiful that ball hit in the exact same spot that's really cool okay so we can actually this is kind of neat", "start": 352.34, "duration": 15.099}

{"chunk": "is going to be at 70 or 75 percent and show me one that starts left of your alignment Target so see where that dot is where those golf balls hit so the", "start": 386.16, "duration": 18.299}

{"chunk": "there so it's like a half a degree left sure now you're definitely going to see that magnified as the ball is is flying out there in space", "start": 416.16, "duration": 17.581000000000003}
{"chunk": "but like we got 15 feet until we hit this screen here right and the golf ball is like just a half a degree left well if you keep seeing it go all the", "start": 424.56, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "way to Apex you're going to notice for sure like on a trackman or whatever that golf ball is slightly left but that's like five yards left there exactly let's", "start": 433.44, "duration": 15.898999999999997}
{"chunk": "do that again go ahead and set up stock sure okay now this one go ahead and start this one right of your alignment Target", "start": 441.419, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "okay beautiful all right so why don't you athlete talk to us about just generally what you're feeling I might", "start": 455.66, "duration": 16.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "get into the science of what's going on here but just talk to us a little bit about what you're sensing there for like anything off of stocks so do you", "start": 465.3, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "want to start with the right one or the left one uh let's start with left okay um so if we talk about Center of mass that's one of the main things that I", "start": 473.759, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "think you can kind of control so Center mass of the gulf Center mass of the golf club um so that Tipping Point right there yeah perfect when I want to start the", "start": 481.979, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "ball left I feel that the center of mass is slightly more on top of the plane okay", "start": 490.199, "duration": 18.181}
{"chunk": "as I'm approaching the Impact Zone so in my body to kind of produce that I'm feeling probably a little bit earlier", "start": 497.94, "duration": 16.338}
{"chunk": "rib rotation okay to keep the center of mass up on top of the plane beautiful and I'm staying in in hip flexion longer", "start": 506.599, "duration": 16.302}
{"chunk": "okay so I can really turn the corner here curve The Hub path around the golf ball again the path meeting that hand path if you will yep", "start": 514.86, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "um that kind of makes sense so that's left shot yeah what's right shot feel like so if we use Center of mass again I feel like Center of mass is falling well", "start": 524.64, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "under the plane again my pattern just what I'm feeling for for a starting right ball well under the plane and I'm", "start": 533.76, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "delaying the rotation of the ribs left towards the target I feel like they're more or less expanding okay instead of", "start": 541.74, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "rotating around so I get this look and you're talking about the left the left side of my rib complex yeah so I'm seeing it go that way okay so you're", "start": 550.08, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "feeling like this almost climbs yep as the center of mass is going down yeah if I want to start the ball a little bit further right okay beautiful and so", "start": 558.3, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "that's a that's a great way to articulate just a sensation of of like what's happening in your swing and guys by the way like at the end of the day", "start": 566.04, "duration": 18.14}
{"chunk": "what we want is you to athletically feel really really nice and what you might even sense from TJ there and I would have the same", "start": 575.16, "duration": 19.139}

{"chunk": "it's really tough because we can like feel it like yeah like even like Rory when he's swinging it well he might be asked in an interview like", "start": 592.44, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "hey what have you been working on to hit it so good and he goes uh I'm trying to do less it's so hard to", "start": 601.8, "duration": 15.779}
{"chunk": "explain right so um let's talk about what's like actually actually happening here in order to do this so let's go ahead and face the", "start": 609.06, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "camera go ahead and set up for me here okay and let's just go into like P6 so just past the delivery sure", "start": 618.12, "duration": 17.979}
{"chunk": "okay at this position right here ideally draws and cuts by the way we're talking about like small differences like you saw TJ's golf ball start like a", "start": 628.32, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "half a degree left half a degree right we're not talking about big old roll Hooks and like big old like wipey cuts from right here for a draw or a cut", "start": 637.38, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "you're gonna look similar okay which is kind of trippy now from right here let's say we wanted to just move the golf bar start the golf", "start": 644.88, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "ball left what we need to do is have the hand complex or what we call the Hub radically Arc into this into this left", "start": 654.3, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "hip complex so before you do this okay this is going to move on a curve into this space okay and see how even when TJ does this", "start": 663.48, "duration": 18.299}
{"chunk": "how it moved away from the space it's over here this would actually move in there so it's really radically curving", "start": 672.839, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "left so it feels like it goes right into the hip there right into the hip now obviously we're not just going to run it right into the hip no and the hands and arms what we typically like to see is", "start": 681.12, "duration": 18.899}
{"chunk": "these are responding to what's happening to the main engine meaning the ribs and the pelvic complex okay so if you could teach I want you to actively move this", "start": 690.72, "duration": 22.681}
{"chunk": "hip complex and the rib complex away so that we could move the Hub into this space so I'm going to keep my hand right here there we go you see how this really", "start": 700.98, "duration": 20.44}
{"chunk": "moves around and curves radically meaning it's a sharp curve right here yes when TJ moved that way notice how he", "start": 713.16, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "stays in dual hip flexion for longer and he shoved the the Pivot Point meaning where the point in space that he's rotating from like if you think of a", "start": 721.62, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "door if the hinges are over here and this would be the door handle this would be the pivot point and the door handle would move around that space okay so his", "start": 729.899, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "right hip complex would be that pivot point in your mind's eye to move this lead hip complex away so see how it would move perpendicular to the Target", "start": 738.3, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "and then away from the target like as fast as you can fast not meaning speed wise but just like get it out of there because we need that handle of the Hub", "start": 747.36, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "to radically curve into that space okay so what does that do well number one it's going to move the path of the center of mass of the club", "start": 756.959, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "or the club head itself more radically left okay okay which we need for the golf ball to", "start": 766.26, "duration": 15.659000000000002}
{"chunk": "be able to curve to the right because this wiping feel yeah okay is what we need what it also does is it's going to delay", "start": 774.66, "duration": 18.541}
{"chunk": "the unload in the hands okay okay and the reason being is the sharper I curve this go ahead and go into P6 again for us", "start": 783.36, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "we would say that this is still loaded see the angle from the shaft to the trail forearm well the sharper I curve this the more that these forces here are", "start": 792.6, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "going to stay loaded loaded loaded so start curving this curve curve curve curve curve there you go what's really interesting look how square that face is", "start": 802.079, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "this really radically curved this direction this doesn't unload so by this not unloading the face", "start": 810.54, "duration": 15.659}
{"chunk": "doesn't flash as fast meaning it's not rotating here yep so we're going to have a dynamic impact where the face may be", "start": 818.399, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "pointing at the Target line or slightly left of the target line but the path is going to be moving even further left than that got it and that's what ball", "start": 827.579, "duration": 18.781}
{"chunk": "flight is we're just in general it's not a hundred percent this but it's a good way of of seeing things where the face is at impact where it's pointed in space", "start": 836.7, "duration": 18.898}
{"chunk": "is where the golf ball is going to start off in general it's different for wedges than it is for driver but just as a starting point we need the face to point", "start": 846.779, "duration": 18.781}
{"chunk": "left of the alignment Target if we're going to start it left actually start it that way yeah yes okay and then on top of that", "start": 856.139, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "we need for curvature for a ball that's moving to the right for right-handed player we need the path to be even further left than where the face is", "start": 863.04, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "pointed so if I'm pointing face roughly down the target line here at impact yep first is the golf ball going to start then down the target line it's going to", "start": 872.639, "duration": 16.621}
{"chunk": "start right on your target line and then if the path is slightly left then the ball would curve to the right but start down the target line still", "start": 881.88, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "exactly so it would be a straight cut straight cut so if we're going to have a pull cut the face would actually need to", "start": 889.86, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "be relatively close to Target line exactly with the path moving further left then the face is pointed yes and what we need to do is really talk about", "start": 897.72, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "how we're getting the face further left than where it already started okay because if you cheat it yeah that's not a what you're doing is", "start": 907.26, "duration": 15.78}
{"chunk": "you're throwing pronation and supination in here which makes the face shut down that Dynamic produces a hook yeah okay so without", "start": 915.66, "duration": 19.019999999999996}
{"chunk": "getting into all the Dynamics of this because it's not within our system anyway so she really gives a crap okay what we need is to curve", "start": 924.66, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "you your main engine more so this is a dress okay okay and this is going to be really subtle guys on camera won't really be able to see this because we're talking about small degrees in the club", "start": 933.0, "duration": 18.539}
{"chunk": "face here sure but what I want you to do is preset impact where the golf ball would start left because of rotation in the chest and in the pelvis", "start": 942.779, "duration": 21.3}
{"chunk": "there it went it went one degree okay so it's slightly closed exactly because I'm curving the you curved so much that now", "start": 952.199, "duration": 19.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "finally this moved to get the golf ball or the face slightly close to where it started okay we're talking about a degree or two sure that's all it takes but now look at the space that you", "start": 963.18, "duration": 19.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "created for the Hub to move that way so just show like a little like stay right here and then just show where the Hub would kind of go through the strike there you go", "start": 972.36, "duration": 18.9}

{"chunk": "that he hits starts left of his alignment Target and then curves back onto it yeah it's every freaking shot that he hits yeah and it's kind of trippy too because sometimes like I'll", "start": 1026.839, "duration": 16.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "be watching like on TV like him play and I go oh it all starts like started left and then you watch where it lands you're like oh okay that was really good and it's like", "start": 1035.299, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "I mean he hits it great hits it right like super efficient golf ball okay so let's go ahead and show another one of those and let's do it at like a low", "start": 1044.0, "duration": 18.36}

{"chunk": "definitely I was able to start it more left yeah and then right just you're good at sensing things because you've hit so many golf balls in your life what it would that golf ball have curved left", "start": 1073.4, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "would have gone straight or would have cut in your mind that would have curved fairly substantially to the right there you go so that is that is a great way and guys try this with driver", "start": 1081.86, "duration": 19.137999999999998}

{"chunk": "and then the golf ball just goes somewhere but you can curve this hard start it left gosh it's so hard to start a golf ball left through rotation you", "start": 1100.4, "duration": 16.021}

{"chunk": "right I have an uphill right to left chipper like a 30 foot uphill right to left putt I can be aggressive with that 100 okay for a right-handed player again", "start": 1168.559, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "okay so there's cut it's a long video yeah um let's talk about draw okay okay", "start": 1175.76, "duration": 15.181}
{"chunk": "um so go ahead and show us the draw again sure foreign boom yep you just do it we're not even going to explain it you're just gonna", "start": 1184.28, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "show and tell first okay we'll show and then we'll tell beautiful okay so here we go again let's", "start": 1196.58, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "go right up here again face onto the camera okay and go into that P6 position again okay", "start": 1204.26, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "okay so here's the idea from right here what we need is the center of mass of the golf club to continue to go down", "start": 1211.58, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "okay so the how TJ is going to do this is he's going to throw an active UD which by the way so ulnar deviation", "start": 1219.02, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "is this that's UD okay if I've already got extension and I'm throwing UD you're also going to have some supination of", "start": 1228.919, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "this Trail form as you do that it just happens like UD leaks into that supination but what it does is it keeps the center of mass of the club working", "start": 1237.2, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "down or under the plane okay that's number one number two the idea here is that the the rib complex", "start": 1245.6, "duration": 19.86}
{"chunk": "this spiral line that goes under TJ's lead armpit goes over his abdomen and then over this Trail hip complex we want", "start": 1255.32, "duration": 19.681}
{"chunk": "the hip complex to extend mm-hmm properly okay so it's not active and that I'm just like trying to extend this", "start": 1265.58, "duration": 15.419999999999998}
{"chunk": "Trail hip because see how nothing's going on in our ribs right now what we're going to do is let this climb and feel like it just keeps working up", "start": 1273.74, "duration": 19.380000000000003}
{"chunk": "and then this gets pulled on the reason we want that is because look at where the Hub just went see how now it's not radically arcing anymore", "start": 1282.74, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "it's going here it's going at the Target and obviously it's going to go up but the up part we don't really need to feel this like up it's more I want the Hub to", "start": 1291.5, "duration": 17.78}
{"chunk": "go more towards the target it's on a much less radical curve okay and the reason", "start": 1300.74, "duration": 16.779}
{"chunk": "for that is is this so again we have this like dual fulcrum system here but in general if we got the golf club over", "start": 1308.24, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "here at P6 okay this in my mind is going down but at the same time you're moving the the upper spiral to move the Hub at", "start": 1316.22, "duration": 15.06}
{"chunk": "me like at the Target Line This is going to start to unload I'm already actively unloading it and if the Hub is going at the Target the unload is here", "start": 1323.78, "duration": 20.459}
{"chunk": "got it so what we're experiencing what you'll feel athletically is a is an earlier unload for the most part there you go", "start": 1333.98, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "that's it and so look at where the center of mass go back to where you just were like that little okay cool in there how are you moving the center of mass through the strike", "start": 1343.159, "duration": 17.211}
{"chunk": "[Music] good and where's the unload there you go see where the golf club's coming from so what we've got as this", "start": 1352.39, "duration": 17.528999999999996}
{"chunk": "whole complex starts to unload more you're going to have the appropriate amount of forearm rotation which is pronation", "start": 1360.98, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "and supination of the arms but passively you don't have to actively throw it it's rotating the rate of rotation the", "start": 1369.08, "duration": 15.420000000000002}
{"chunk": "club face is going to go up slightly because of the interaction of where the Hub path is moving in space because of that spiral and because we're curving", "start": 1377.24, "duration": 20.7}
{"chunk": "this gradually the unload is in here so now there we go there goes the golf club now what's nice it's still very stable yeah it's not like you're looking this", "start": 1386.9, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "way no at all so we're not rolling it in order to do that you're just moving the Hub and the spiral or excuse me the center of mass and the spiral in space", "start": 1396.26, "duration": 19.078}
{"chunk": "to control where the Hub is moving so this is less that is is more of a gradual Arc rather than a radical one like the cut and that makes this unload", "start": 1405.679, "duration": 18.002}
{"chunk": "earlier and makes the rate of rotation the club face go up slightly okay there's draw pattern got it and because of that as well we've got the path", "start": 1415.4, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "moving over here to the right the face also is going to be appropriately over to the right like it's going to be slightly open yeah slightly open with", "start": 1423.559, "duration": 15.541}
{"chunk": "the path moving further right than that exactly so the slightly open to the alignment Target makes the golf ball start slightly right got it with a right path", "start": 1431.9, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "compared to where the face is that's a block draw again slight yeah like ideally it's like oh it started two or three degrees to the right and it fell", "start": 1440.6, "duration": 17.639999999999997}
{"chunk": "back on the target line okay okay so let's do this again and what I think would be really nice is to show you're still within the system so again", "start": 1449.0, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "we're not rolling it over doing anything crazy here but show us a fairly substantial like how far can you push push this system to make the golf ball", "start": 1457.7, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "start over here to the right and then it would draw back and we'll just slow this down and compare it to one that we're going to do move the system way over to", "start": 1466.159, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "the left and hit one to the left so this is the one that starts way right how far right can you get it foreign", "start": 1475.159, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "okay cool now let's hit another one okay and how far left can you get the golf ball started here good", "start": 1481.88, "duration": 15.019}
{"chunk": "beautiful so if you slow both of those down TJ in this video and just put them either side by side or one right after the other then what", "start": 1496.059, "duration": 15.462}
{"chunk": "we'll see is like the differences of what the Hub looks like where the golf club is unloading there might be slight differences in where the shaft appears", "start": 1504.08, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "like through the ribs on the other side at like p8 yep like you're we're gonna see like all these like little differences that'd be P9 by the way it's", "start": 1512.78, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "wrong um we'll see all these like little subtle differences that make the golf ball like you're commanding the golf ball all of a sudden", "start": 1520.64, "duration": 16.26}
{"chunk": "oh I started one to the right oh I started one to the left now just bring them Tighter and Tighter in like you did at the start where it's like one degree left one degree right and these like", "start": 1528.44, "duration": 17.038000000000004}
{"chunk": "little subtle movers yeah but oh my gosh you get to the point where it's like you command the golf ball at such a high level and you'll stand over it and the", "start": 1536.539, "duration": 18.122}
{"chunk": "sensations that you have in your hands and in your whole body is like dude you know where the golf ball is going to start and how it's going to curve it's", "start": 1546.08, "duration": 18.058999999999997}
{"chunk": "actually good that is like next level and those of you that are watching this channel that are higher level players you know that feel", "start": 1554.72, "duration": 15.781}
{"chunk": "and we're always trying to like gain that feel back I assure you you don't get that feel by trying to hit stock ball after stockball after stockball and", "start": 1562.7, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "trying out different things just on for size to see if it works it doesn't work what works is start it right start at", "start": 1572.36, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "left start at low hit it short hit it hard every shot is different than the previous one because you gain The Sensation from that as long as you have", "start": 1580.039, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "a system to go on now you understand shop making you like own your golf swing that way and that's what we're looking for that's what we're", "start": 1588.679, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "looking for ball flights sweet dude baller", "start": 1596.84, "duration": 9.219}
