{"chunk": "today we're talking about how to start your gol swing Super Pump let's dive talking about this idea of like rib sway what the heck is rib sway what what", "start": 0.12, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "is that so rib sways kind of the lateral movement of your torso of your upper body without moving your lower body so I", "start": 14.36, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "kind of feel like my sternum is starting to relocate over my trail and lead hit", "start": 22.64, "duration": 15.719}
{"chunk": "as I'm doing this so because you say this term spirals as well and Y like if you're new new to our Channel like we talk about spiral line all the time and spiral line Tyler if you could face that", "start": 30.92, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "way for just a second the spiral line you can just look this up or we can put it up on the frame it goes like over and through Tyler's scap and then it'll go", "start": 40.079, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "underneath Tyler's armpit now start facing me it goes this way diagonal across his ABD abdomen and then over this this um", "start": 49.16, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "opposing hip complex when you're talking rib sway that's spiral line right like go ahead and set up again and just hug the club for me so", "start": 58.879, "duration": 19.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "if you if you laterally sway the ribs in that direction go ahead and do that beautiful you can even see like in his wrinkles in his shirt do that one more", "start": 67.68, "duration": 18.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "time so this is neutral there's the sway from this hip complex underneath that armpit you'll see all of that like if that were a rubber band it all elongates", "start": 77.36, "duration": 19.16}
{"chunk": "so you're loading up the spiral you call it we rib sway yep which is a fancy way of talking about the spiral line Yep this other idea of geometry can you just", "start": 87.52, "duration": 19.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "hold the club up level to the ground where does the club move in space just show us that where's it moving in space okay so there's this like if we're", "start": 96.6, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "looking right here if I put a sensor right there which would be like the balance point of the golf club we call it the center of mass if you want to get fancy but just in general if we just", "start": 105.0, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "watched where this moved like in that waggle it's that shape it's just like little Circle little oval right in here so its initial movement is this vertical", "start": 114.56, "duration": 19.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "look and then it goes over here and then back into the ball our mind is working in anticipations it is anticipatory how", "start": 123.92, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "do I want to move the golf club in space so you can preset that in your mind on how that is working along with your lateral movement from your feet or your", "start": 131.8, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "ribs y so if you set up again for us let's see one now and this will be like a neckolas waggle so neckolas would always waggle the club if just stay", "start": 141.08, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "right in your posture it would go up he'd pause and then it Go whoop it's like up here hovers boom that shape it's", "start": 150.2, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "the same shape that you made up here right yep if it's that shape we're just doing it down by the ball as you're wiggling your feet this is the waggle go", "start": 158.64, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "ahead and show us that good and if you can do it where you're like really bouncy with the ribs and the feet and making that same little", "start": 166.0, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "shape good excellent now if you can te go ahead and just bounce into that and go ahead and hit us a shot again o really cool", "start": 174.84, "duration": 21.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "waggle beautiful really cool Okay so we've talked about like kind of really like two different ideas here", "start": 185.44, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "this lateral movement from body really feet ribs blah blah blah and geometry in the club so now let's talk about like", "start": 196.28, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "when you're actually like this is all preset preset kind of priming your system and then now we actually want to get into swing start there is an order", "start": 204.44, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "of events here right that we need to follow through with right the order of events should always be the lateral movement first so we're talking body", "start": 212.12, "duration": 19.721000000000004}
{"chunk": "movement first and then the golf club is responsive to that meaning it it's following like if we had two dominoes set up the body would knock over first", "start": 221.68, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "and then here goes the golf club again so let's show F we'll piece this out to start with go ahead and set up to the ball so we're sequencing this thing", "start": 230.12, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "right now we're sequencing this sucker so if you could just show now this lateral movement you'll feel it in your feet you'll feel it in your ribs of the", "start": 238.04, "duration": 16.039}
{"chunk": "rib complex moving good beautiful do that one more time and what you'll see here in in Tyler's knees this is really cool this is like a Rory ISM go ahead", "start": 245.84, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "and do that again okay there see how this knee almost hides behind this knee do that again from from setup watch", "start": 254.36, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "just the angle that there you go see where the shaft goes yeah do that one more time so we're one and ALS so how far did the golf club move not at all", "start": 263.36, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "freaking zero right well we got the rib sway done you feel this pressure in your Trail foot y now if you kept spiraling you've already primed it because you got", "start": 271.84, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "rib sway go ahead and start turning in the chest see how this is just floating along turn turn turn turn turn nothing's going on here yet but your midline", "start": 280.08, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "moved okay so the start of the golf swing we got that lateral movement boom now start turning the midline there's", "start": 288.84, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "two three would would finally be geometry where this is the shape see how the golf club's working up and then it would work in here so this this whole", "start": 297.72, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "like if we want to get fancy from P1 which is a dress to like Club halfway back P2 we got three things going on", "start": 307.199, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "right in order sequential right okay so let's do this again from beautiful setup let's see that lateral movement the club won't even move an inch Good Start", "start": 315.919, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "gently turning and you won't even do anything with your arms hands and Club beautiful now go ahead and start getting that that Center of mass working up", "start": 326.319, "duration": 15.841999999999999}
{"chunk": "beautiful that's all swing start and it's nice because if you do it and I know shoot the golf swing lasts", "start": 333.56, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "like what 9/10 of a second something like that it's like fraking very short period of time but starting your golf swing should not be this like boom", "start": 343.08, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "lightning bolt like uh right it needs to like we talk about waves of energy a lot well waves build they they don't just", "start": 351.36, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "right right they do this they build build build build build and then they Crest right the building portion this initial portion of your golf swing", "start": 360.72, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "should should freaking feel like it takes a while the appropriate amount of time to organize things organize systems get everything working like we want and", "start": 368.759, "duration": 17.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "then you can build into the wave and crash it out yeah so show us this again and show us pieced out if you could and", "start": 377.8, "duration": 15.318999999999999}
{"chunk": "as you're doing it I'll just kind of walk walk through this with you lateral movement and again the club didn't move at all upper spiral which is the chest", "start": 385.36, "duration": 20.081}
{"chunk": "rotation now the vertical nature of this of that golf club and there's the start of the geometry right that Golf Club went vertical so let's see this again", "start": 394.68, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "okay and let's just see kind of that like halfway is back like P2 P3 but it's all bouncy now so you're going one two 3", "start": 403.319, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "lateral chest vertical nature of the club to just get it going and freeze boom boom two three see the bounce now do that again", "start": 412.36, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "boom beautiful okay let's go ahead and hit one now boom boom boom hit that was pretty fun so good but see", "start": 421.879, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "it's organized yeah and so like yeah swing start of course you can have like one thing in your mind that's like your trigger to go yeah but what's nice with", "start": 434.68, "duration": 18.44}
{"chunk": "this and we talk about this a ton is like movement has elements to it it's not just one thing yeah there's a there's a series of movements that", "start": 444.24, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "happen that allow you to like get all the sensories like I feel stuff you earn feel from the actual movement but the", "start": 452.84, "duration": 16.359}
{"chunk": "sequence of that movement so swing start happens 100% before you even actually do start your swing and your Waggles your", "start": 459.879, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "lateral movement your Dynamics to kind of get you organized yeah but you want those things to be able to drip into the actual movement of your golf swing like", "start": 468.68, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "what happens and in what SE sequence yeah so you got three things you got your laterals which are in your feet you'll feel it in your feet like pressures in your feet a lot of that's", "start": 477.24, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "just going to come from rib sway like if you sway that way there's the pressure into the right foot and again the golf club hasn't even moved yet you're just going lateral first then we're going to", "start": 486.96, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "go chest rotation which will get the whole arm hand and Club structure moving and then finally that Center mass of the golf club will just get popped up in", "start": 495.8, "duration": 20.641}
{"chunk": "order lateral spirals or chest and the geometry the golf club that vertical nature of the golf club hit them well any questions you have write them below", "start": 505.4, "duration": 19.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "we will absolutely comment back hit flushers baby let's [Music] go", "start": 515.56, "duration": 17.942}
