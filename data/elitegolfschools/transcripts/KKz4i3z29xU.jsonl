{"chunk": "pelvic rotation which leads to active hip extension okay and the trail hip okay so for us as around here in player we are right our right hip is actively", "start": 55.739, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "extending going out that way exactly because as soon as I start to rotate the pelvis tendency is as this goes out and it doesn't happen every time but like the", "start": 65.64, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "majority of the time that's what's going to happen or we have this flexion pattern where in the transition there's there's more or less just a drop now", "start": 74.22, "duration": 17.939}

{"chunk": "primarily is somebody that drops in the pelvis which in essence is going to elongate the spine so a lot of the space between facet joints and you could probably find", "start": 111.06, "duration": 18.301000000000002}
{"chunk": "a picture of what the facet joint is TJ and put it up for us they're the little fans like these little like fingers that stick out of the spine on my back okay", "start": 120.42, "duration": 18.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "okay and the more that I go into uh active pelvic rotation that space shrinks I'm going to I'm going to rotate", "start": 128.819, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "and so I don't have as much space which creates cellular damage which creates inflammation which creates pain okay so that's where a lot of injuries come from", "start": 138.0, "duration": 16.258}
{"chunk": "sure compared to if I drop that space if anything it gets a little bit further away so I have space to play with there so then rotation and side Bend is fine", "start": 145.319, "duration": 15.722}

{"chunk": "those to bend a lot so if you think about a tree that's standing the only time that it really breaks is when there's enough wind to bend it down", "start": 232.14, "duration": 19.497999999999998}

{"chunk": "let's go to the top go to like P4 for us and before you even do that let's do this and go about this we'll creep up on this sure dissociation is another like", "start": 258.72, "duration": 17.999}

{"chunk": "that swing it to the top again and from there I want you to actively rotate the pelvis", "start": 303.54, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "okay good and if you kept going just keep rotating the pelvis see how far out the golf club wants to go so now here's where injury goes now", "start": 311.34, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "we're going to do this slightly so I don't hurt you but you would tilt in the L spine to make this the the golf club go down now because you got to get to", "start": 320.58, "duration": 16.259999999999998}

{"chunk": "you're static that way you don't feel it as much when it's Dynamic and you get that energy out of there but over the course of time what you're doing is you're just banging up individual like", "start": 337.08, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "joints yep less space more cellular damage inflammation all kinds of problems okay okay compared to let's go", "start": 345.78, "duration": 15.66}

{"chunk": "time okay now we can't get the golf club to the golf ball yet because we haven't turned in the chest so now just turn the chest", "start": 362.759, "duration": 15.661000000000001}

{"chunk": "force it shoots energy out so right now I have this loaded over here on my right side if I turn I'll go ahead and go", "start": 378.84, "duration": 15.299}
{"chunk": "first so we don't claim clubs again so if I go turn here and I'm passive enough loaded it unloads the golf club just", "start": 386.699, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "spits out of there the golf club spits out on relatively a perpendicular line to your t-spine okay got it okay so let's do that one more time so let's go", "start": 396.18, "duration": 16.979999999999997}
{"chunk": "up to the top we're going to show active pelvic rotation good now what would you have to do to get to the golf club to the ground there", "start": 404.94, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "you go so now we're like anti-rotation in the chest and all side Bend sure that leaks down into the L spine problem yeah", "start": 412.74, "duration": 16.558}
{"chunk": "okay so that's ineffective extension because it is active extension in the trail hip because of active rotation in", "start": 420.539, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "the pelvis again active being the operative word okay we need passive extension okay okay so what passive", "start": 428.699, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "extension is TJ you'd be all a little show show guy just hold right here sure okay so backswing", "start": 437.28, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "drop okay this spiral line the upper spiral that goes over or excuse me under TJ's lead armpit is over this this uh", "start": 444.72, "duration": 19.919}

{"chunk": "all the way to finish there you go that is a fully extended position right there it's light got it and it happened because I was", "start": 472.139, "duration": 19.641}
{"chunk": "moving more or less the upper t-spine rather than the hips itself you're rotating like it if I if I just stood", "start": 482.34, "duration": 19.119}
{"chunk": "here and just went level even so and I'm just rotating the chest to face you and I keep pulling pulling pulling your pelvis eventually does something yeah so", "start": 491.819, "duration": 18.901}
{"chunk": "my pelvis rotated yep well I could go I'm going to look at you so the active is what we see first so", "start": 501.72, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "active chest rotation passive pelvic rotation because it got pulled on which is why we say chess is the engine right chest is the engine", "start": 511.86, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "starts everything up and we want passive hip extension okay we need extension otherwise you just", "start": 521.039, "duration": 15.300999999999998}
{"chunk": "stay dropped yeah that doesn't look like a door there yeah yeah like if you just go drop turn and this is frozen you're", "start": 528.54, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "like limiting how much Mobility you have in the forward side like nobody looks like that totally that's worth a dark so those are really the spectrums so", "start": 536.339, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "we've got guys like our preferred pattern we would see uh Hogan we would see Trevino we would see hovland we", "start": 544.98, "duration": 22.8}

{"chunk": "guys there's just Health consequences old Jason day Scotty Scheffler those guys are in this", "start": 565.32, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "like more active extension in the trail hip and they have to bend in their L spine to", "start": 573.72, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "fix it got it health consequences okay um that that's what we're really looking at plus like if we go down just a little", "start": 582.12, "duration": 16.198}
{"chunk": "bit Vijay Singh Phil Mickelson are over here on the like active extension the rate of rotation in the club face is", "start": 590.399, "duration": 17.222}
{"chunk": "just higher yeah okay now they're pretty good players yeah so you can play golf that way 100 yeah um but just know that", "start": 598.98, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "the rate of rotation of the club face is going to go up when you look at like Trevino Hogan those guys the club face doesn't turn", "start": 608.16, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "over it just is like super super stable extremely Square yep exactly so there's positives and negatives from from both", "start": 616.26, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "now what you need to regulate is like what kind of a player you are like if you are a heavier dude like Mama's cooking is", "start": 624.839, "duration": 18.72}

{"chunk": "that's that's going to just work through me into the ball right it translates into that somebody that is smaller so we", "start": 642.0, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "see a lot of extension out of young kids let them extend let them extend let them extend like you need to figure out how to hit something hard", "start": 650.7, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "and there's no real Health consequences to it because they weigh 60 pounds sure so and a lot of like the pressure when", "start": 658.86, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "you put it on individual joint groups is like it's because of all the mass that crushes that one point in space well 60", "start": 666.18, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "pounds is like nothing you're fine plus they're more pliable blah blah and that's why like on the LPGA Tour compared to the PGA Tour live there is a", "start": 674.16, "duration": 21.061}

{"chunk": "still prefer a passive rotation in both like for men women Juniors everybody a passive rotation pattern is going to be", "start": 718.32, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "better but you can still let that go earlier if you're lighter if you're heavier you probably want to stay dropped and turn on that sucker sure", "start": 726.66, "duration": 17.92}
