{"chunk": "we go a lot over technique which is very very important like um you've said it to me before like before you can even touch speed you've", "start": 39.719, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "got to be efficient in what you actually do to the golf ball so that's what all that technique is for but still one of the most frequently asked questions is okay how do I pour on the gas how do I", "start": 48.059, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "hit a little bit harder yeah and I think we're gonna go all over the place so just sure you bear with me okay because I'm in a freaking squirrel mode I like", "start": 57.239, "duration": 16.862000000000002}
{"chunk": "squirrel modes okay so holy cowlick there are so many different ways to go about doing this okay and everybody's system of swinging the", "start": 65.22, "duration": 17.879}
{"chunk": "golf club is vastly different one of the main things that you have to do as as a player and managing this is be very very", "start": 74.4, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "honest with yourself okay if we're being super Frank yep most people don't hit it as far as they feel like they should", "start": 82.08, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "because they swing it like crud fair enough okay like movements whack yeah sequence of movement is whack and", "start": 91.02, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "we could we can see that very easily because I think on the PGA tour smash factor is like 1.48", "start": 100.32, "duration": 19.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "most people don't even really sniff that no they're doing something to the ball that's just so that's the caveat that we got to", "start": 109.759, "duration": 16.599999999999998}

{"chunk": "of them come on yeah friggin let's go grab it up okay so with that being said let's start this off and I kind of like the direction that we're going because I", "start": 182.28, "duration": 18.059}

{"chunk": "going to talk about three main forces when we're talking about movement here okay there's a ton of them but we're going to talk about a rotational Force", "start": 217.319, "duration": 16.381}
{"chunk": "okay okay so meaning our body is rotating and what that's going to do to the instrument it's going to shoot energy out so that's centrifugal force", "start": 225.12, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "which is the outward shoot of anything that's working in a circle so that's also angular velocity so if TJ is turning go ahead and just set up with", "start": 234.42, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "the golf club just hanging right here TJ just like this good and you'll just hold it right in between your first two fingers that way good now see the the", "start": 242.4, "duration": 16.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "shafts hanging vertically yep just start turning in a circle okay we'll see where that shaft went yeah it just shot that's cool yeah it's", "start": 251.34, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "super cool oh it just goes so it doesn't just stay vertical the whole time it shoots out that's angular velocity that's so the rotational Force shoots", "start": 259.919, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "the club head out yes exactly so that is I'm creating a force meaning my body's going and the club is almost responsive to that", "start": 268.08, "duration": 19.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "circles okay okay the other one is a down and up Force okay okay um so we've heard that as vertical Force", "start": 277.259, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "we've heard that as ground reaction force a lot of different ways to describe that but in essence what that does TJ just go to the top you just hold", "start": 286.38, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "the golf club up here okay now just hold it with your right hand if you could good now keep the club", "start": 294.479, "duration": 15.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "up there and just drop a ton okay and now jump only just jump", "start": 301.86, "duration": 16.078000000000003}
{"chunk": "good what should happen is as TJ jumps the golf club is going to shoot out and down there you go exactly nice hops by the", "start": 309.479, "duration": 16.182}
{"chunk": "way it's like Phil Nichols you look like Phil in his mind bro so yeah and what's important as I go", "start": 322.62, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "through these forces what is responsive to the movement what is responding to the movement the", "start": 330.12, "duration": 20.34}
{"chunk": "clubhead the club yeah the club exactly so when you started turning oh the club responded got it when you went down and", "start": 339.96, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "jumped now the club responded and went down and up you went up those damn Club went down and out right okay so that's", "start": 347.759, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "another one and the last one is probably my favorite for this because people just don't do this at all is lateral Force so side to side meaning this is going to be", "start": 356.039, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "our Target line right here okay well and for showing this this is really good this is TJ's Target line so he'd be hitting a ball this way lateral is just and you can do this", "start": 365.4, "duration": 18.180999999999997}
{"chunk": "super athletically so we're just going to boom boom kind of skate and to and fro there you go so TJ is moving laterally here and when we're talking", "start": 375.06, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "lateral sure the pelvis moves a little bit lateral it does but really the idea here is that the rib system is moving laterally", "start": 383.58, "duration": 16.381}
{"chunk": "and always what is responding to what clubs responding to that exactly so if", "start": 392.34, "duration": 15.117999999999999}
{"chunk": "you if you go ahead and set up TJ and you start moving laterally there you go good so let's go ahead and slow this down so move lateral and let", "start": 399.479, "duration": 17.101999999999997}
{"chunk": "this just stay here for a second okay and eventually now you'll go ahead and turns responded now as you move here that will still be going up in space or", "start": 408.36, "duration": 19.56}
{"chunk": "back in space as he's moving lateral so now here's the big one to shoot this out down the target line that rib system goes that way", "start": 417.6, "duration": 20.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "there you go now already that's a lot just thinking about each one of those forces sure individually yeah well what happens in", "start": 427.139, "duration": 19.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "really good golf swings all three of those forces there's a common are working Harmony yeah like you look at Rory McIlroy move", "start": 437.819, "duration": 15.841999999999999}
{"chunk": "the reason he's the best driver of the golf ball in history is he does all three of those forces like phenomenally", "start": 445.5, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "phenomenally yep so good it's unbelievable all three of them yeah so if you want to be a better driver of the golf ball which we're talking about distance", "start": 453.62, "duration": 17.118}
{"chunk": "to be considered a good driver of the golf ball you better booty it you better you can't just Boop 220. man you hit it straight every time nobody goes he's such a good driver", "start": 463.94, "duration": 19.481}
{"chunk": "of the ball yeah they might compliment your wedge game or something but they're not they're not coming in that yeah exactly because your third shot on a par", "start": 473.28, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "four is a wedge you better be good at it because you can't freaking get it to the hole so you've got to hit it hard yeah you have to I mean that's especially", "start": 481.56, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "like you know the aspiring Junior that's playing today like you go watch I watch the usam two weeks ago at Cherry Hills", "start": 490.259, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "those guys are hitting it so it's Colorado for sure sure but it comes in 400 yards it comes off the face and you're like that is not like anything I", "start": 498.379, "duration": 18.22}
{"chunk": "saw yeah there's like a like and I I saw this I'll even throw his name out because he won't mind Jake stiano played at Colorado State and", "start": 508.08, "duration": 15.541}
{"chunk": "played in locals with him in the US Open locals and I'm dude I've seen like good beaters of the ball like the ball goes", "start": 516.24, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "huh and then second gear like there's another one like breaks this like wall bro he hit third yeah one okay two oh", "start": 524.399, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "three and you're like what just alcohol is not coming down dude unbelievable unbelievable right corn fairy tour but", "start": 532.8, "duration": 19.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "he legitimately hits the ball between 380 and 400 yards in Colorado Stock consistently yeah and like total command", "start": 541.32, "duration": 17.86}
{"chunk": "of the ball so especially like saying up and coming Juniors if you're watching this you gotta beat on it have to have to like you can't you can't be content", "start": 550.68, "duration": 18.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "hitting at 270 like you're you're going to get left behind exactly so okay so let's play with this let's hit a couple of shots um what are we gonna mess around with", "start": 559.86, "duration": 17.821}
{"chunk": "Force wise here what do you want why don't we do like one force at a time yes is that that's perfect that's I'm just asking you which course you want to start with well what was the first one", "start": 568.92, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "we talked about first one was rotation yep okay so you want me to just kind of focus on that one yeah and let's just kind of show what we mean if you just", "start": 577.14, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "stay right here facing the golf ball we're gonna pick this up and over onto the right side okay so that golf club now would be leveraged or loaded got it", "start": 585.24, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "so if you just turn we'll just keep it kind of on this rotational aspect here start turning this your ribs and then", "start": 593.459, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "this will respond and shoot good so in essence what what I'd like TJ to see in his mind is if I got the golf club over here", "start": 600.48, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "if I do this slowly see I'm rotating my chest and then the golf club is going to respond there's like a little delay there yep exactly and you could even leverage it", "start": 610.2, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "up over here so we're at like five P5 and that shaft like for those of you weren't working on this should be perpendicular to spine plane got it okay", "start": 618.66, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "so now in your mind if you're rotating around the spine plane the shaft will appear on the other side through there there you go that's the", "start": 628.14, "duration": 19.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "rotational aspect we're rotating around the axis of your spine okay to shoot the golf club around that yes yes and then that that shaft just works around that", "start": 638.04, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "spine so we're there yep exactly so that's the picture let's go ahead and hit one okay where you're arriving into P5 well but now you're just rotating to", "start": 646.98, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "shoot the energy out and around you it's a good good picture I'd say that's a good picture Okay so we're primarily rotational forces a great guy to see do", "start": 654.899, "duration": 17.66}
{"chunk": "this um great rotators on the PGA tour are usually like if they if they use", "start": 670.019, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "their main forces like Road from a rotational aspect we'd see typically kind of bigger dudes like I'm a rotator", "start": 677.579, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "225 pounds I just do this on it so just my mask can shoot energy into the tool okay Brooks kepca a big old Burley dude", "start": 686.66, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "as well yep right look at Brooks great Rotator just goes a lot of the rotational Force yep exactly you don't see his lead foot like d waiting because", "start": 694.68, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "of this vertical aspect he just stays planted on that lead foot you look at like uh Justin Thomas for instance Patrick Reed Patrick Reed that's a", "start": 703.8, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "vertical Force yep okay exactly those are primarily vertical Force guys so let's let's look at like a vertical horse when you talk about unweighting", "start": 711.899, "duration": 15.121999999999998}
{"chunk": "that foot like what do you what what causes that well so this is I mean we'll hear ground reaction force as well so if you go to three", "start": 720.0, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "okay good as the club is still going up here you're going to drop big because vertical force is all a", "start": 729.06, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "um I can't go vertical if I'm here I can't jump jumpers drop jumpers exactly so you will see guys that", "start": 737.82, "duration": 19.559}
{"chunk": "typically will drop quite a bit from like the P3 to P5 range they may even heighten from a dress to P3 slightly so", "start": 747.24, "duration": 18.781}
{"chunk": "they're up so I have a vertical aspect here like a lot of uh like if you watch long drivers they'll be set up they would be", "start": 757.5, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "set up here and their first one of their first moves is this vertical aspect to get taller okay and then as the club is going up", "start": 765.06, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "they'll drop good so now as they're going through impact they're jumping that vertical Force to shoot the energy out you'll", "start": 772.98, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "also this force is great for typically typically is great for smaller so", "start": 781.68, "duration": 15.459999999999999}
{"chunk": "shorter lighter weight individuals okay okay that will help that type of player most often because they don't have as much mass to just use the rotational", "start": 789.72, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "they got to use a little bit of the vertical vertical force is one of the best forces for getting energy out earlier okay and earlier energy Out", "start": 799.32, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "means I'm going to have a dynamic Loft for the shallowness of the angle of attack it's going to get out and then up and I", "start": 807.42, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "get the the shaft pointing see where the shafts pointing for TJ like that ball is going to be launched because it's going up and I've got tons of Loft rotational", "start": 815.399, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "force is great for heavier heavier taller people for the most part because I'm turning that's that's the angle so at a younger age I I trained a little", "start": 823.92, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "bit of that yeah um just hit these like high draws just to maximize the distance but exactly same kind of picture Okay so let's see vertical Force so we're going", "start": 832.139, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "to go vertical down up so we're up down up yes", "start": 841.2, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "first out before the golf club even moves you're going up then you'll go down back up good and you'll see there if you slow that down", "start": 849.6, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "you'll see TJ's foot leave the ground and almost replant around them because obviously it's going this way because you're going to turn we're not just only", "start": 857.22, "duration": 17.700000000000003}
{"chunk": "going vertical but it that one the picture in your mind is vertical through the strike yep for sure yep yep now as as the", "start": 865.92, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "athlete does that feel quite a bit different compared to the previous that felt quite a bit different yeah yeah yeah um it feels like that vertical Force I'm", "start": 874.74, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "if I'm only doing vertical Force I'm going to lose the face a little bit more exactly to be honest yeah like it does vertical yeah equates to to extension of", "start": 884.1, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "the hips right like I would be dropped to be able to go vertical so I have flexion of the hips now I'm vertical and that's what", "start": 894.48, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "shoots it out right so I'm gonna have earlier extension it slows down the rotational force and the rotational Force feels like it stabilizes the face", "start": 902.1, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "so you got to kind of like again play with your steak play with your recipe I think that was the last video but yeah yeah great but yeah if you struggle to", "start": 911.16, "duration": 18.539}
{"chunk": "keep the ball in play sure you probably don't want to be adding a whole lot of vertical Force yep if you keep the ball in play fine you want to bust it you maybe add a little vertical Force yeah", "start": 920.639, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "exactly exactly so and that that leads to the last one um which is this lateral boom boom side", "start": 930.0, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "to side yep exactly exactly and again always the club is responsive to what we're doing and the reason that we want this this out", "start": 937.68, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "right this this shoot out here is it's a very good way like if I see all the pressure in this lead foot yep now as I", "start": 946.38, "duration": 15.181}
{"chunk": "as I'm going back here it shoots the center of mass of the golf club forward okay where you can always think of of", "start": 954.48, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "these forces again this is responding to what I'm doing so if I just go from here to there it shoots It Forward if I'm going around it shoots the golf club", "start": 963.06, "duration": 20.099}
{"chunk": "around me if I'm going up this is going down right so you can just see where the forces are going sure and what's cool is", "start": 972.12, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "when you combine all those in your mind's eye you see this really cool like 3D play of release totally okay so let's", "start": 980.88, "duration": 16.019000000000002}
{"chunk": "see one where we're more lateral here side to side so we'll go before the club even moves from the from its address position we'll see TJ move", "start": 988.44, "duration": 20.04}
{"chunk": "into his Trail foot good then as he turns he's moving in like as the club's still going up he's going into that lead boom there's the land and now he would", "start": 998.04, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "be going away again good exactly so let's see one that's pretty substantial here lateral lateral okay", "start": 1007.88, "duration": 16.541000000000004}
{"chunk": "yep that's I want to do that one more time yeah I think I had the sequence quite right I don't know cool", "start": 1022.66, "duration": 17.139}
{"chunk": "yeah I definitely feel it go that way more uh-huh yep yep and you can just play the play with all three of those that's a good way to just start this", "start": 1034.339, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "okay okay um next these next next like that's like who's one phase two we're just swinging something", "start": 1043.28, "duration": 21.601}
{"chunk": "fast and it needs to be lightweight okay okay so difference between lightweight and heavy so if you had a two by four in", "start": 1052.94, "duration": 17.939}
{"chunk": "your hands lots of mass in that sure so you're going to have we need a heck of a lot more muscle activation during the like throughout", "start": 1062.36, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "the entirety of That Swing it's going to equate to a slow move but you'll know where the two by four is in space because of its mass so it's not that", "start": 1070.64, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "it's a bad way of training it just sure isn't speed training so there's this like old notion of like swing something heavier and you're going", "start": 1079.16, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "to learn to swing faster no that builds slow twitch muscle tissue and you're looking right yep so this is lighter just an", "start": 1087.26, "duration": 20.459000000000003}
{"chunk": "alignment stick a Dell right exactly exactly okay and we're going to swing this with speed this is also to be done there's been some studies too this is", "start": 1097.88, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "where um some companies that just have instruments that you're just swinging in space that you don't have an object like", "start": 1106.58, "duration": 19.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "a golf ball to slow you down sure can be detrimental to health oh okay okay so do this within reason again we're talking like", "start": 1115.64, "duration": 19.62}
{"chunk": "20 or 25 reps starting off okay swinging this and yeah the idea here you could even do 10 reps let's", "start": 1125.36, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "just do 10 reps okay but the idea of this is we're going to make our first rep it's going to be Speedy but the next rep in your mind is going to be more energy", "start": 1133.52, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "than more than more than more than more than more you're just building build from like a base to the 10th rep is going to be as fast as I can swing it basically that's exactly right that's", "start": 1142.039, "duration": 18.540999999999997}
{"chunk": "exactly right let's just do five just so we're not just like huffing okay just first one okay good now show more", "start": 1151.34, "duration": 17.257}
{"chunk": "that's one here's two okay three needs to be faster oh God yeah go okay same inside the systems", "start": 1161.24, "duration": 19.38}

{"chunk": "just a good full go boom okay over the course of time what you're doing is is you're doing two things you're teaching your mind that one it's", "start": 1188.78, "duration": 19.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "okay to go this fast new Milan yep new pathway in your mind yep okay and number two you're teaching", "start": 1201.679, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "the the physiology of it you're building your muscle you're building your muscle in the way that you want you're building fast twitch muscle fiber which just", "start": 1210.2, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "collapses faster bigger energy in that output right where slow twitch is just a slower response and slow twitch muscle muscle tissue is", "start": 1218.0, "duration": 19.479}
{"chunk": "just supportive tissue okay right where okay we need some of that but what we're looking to do right", "start": 1227.299, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "now is we're building boom fast twitch fast explosive tissue here okay so very simple there the other thing that's great", "start": 1234.919, "duration": 16.679}
{"chunk": "um so what is that called even it's a radar What's the title of this swing speed radar yep swing speed radar you", "start": 1243.679, "duration": 16.141}
{"chunk": "can see these like sports quite honestly what we did we just bought these off Amazon I think they're 50 bucks maybe I don't know I I can't", "start": 1251.539, "duration": 19.621}
{"chunk": "even remember but the only the only number I gives you is pure swing speed just gives you pure swing speed every once in a while it'll grab the golf ball", "start": 1261.38, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "and it makes you feel like a beast because it'll go 175 and you're like yeah no it's like it does Miss every once in a while but overall you will see", "start": 1269.0, "duration": 19.74}

{"chunk": "average for where you're at now and as you build over the course of time it's just a great radar to just Track Club speed yeah okay and again", "start": 1287.36, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "50 bucks ish if it's 100 bucks okay no big deal right like you don't you don't need to be go buying all this equipment", "start": 1295.58, "duration": 15.298}
{"chunk": "yeah just buy something basic swing a stick exactly get faster get faster exactly okay so it's a good way to do things too", "start": 1303.559, "duration": 18.302}
