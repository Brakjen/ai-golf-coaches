{"chunk": "beautiful and watch this comes out way different going come on", "start": 8.34, "duration": 19.96}
{"chunk": "[Music] nothing you not a lot dude we're outside today so that's cool it is yeah we have", "start": 15.29, "duration": 19.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "a uh beautiful backdrop being as it's Fallen Colorado yep pretty much the best place on Earth for sure so um", "start": 30.06, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "we got pitching today so let's discuss the golf club first okay because it's not talked about enough simply toe side heel side", "start": 38.28, "duration": 17.941000000000003}
{"chunk": "and then we have three different surfaces on the on the bottom portion of the golf club so we've got Leading Edge which is the knife portion of the golf club", "start": 48.12, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "the bounce is located on the opposing side here so it's this beveled Edge and like you see all these different bounces but this is where the bounce is most", "start": 55.44, "duration": 17.778}
{"chunk": "people think the bounce is the soul is not the soul it's the back portion of the golf club here okay got it so we've got Leading Edge bounce and sole okay", "start": 64.739, "duration": 18.221}
{"chunk": "and heel based and toe based gotcha always there is never a time where we are healed biased heel based when we're", "start": 73.439, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "setting up the golf club so never really exactly with the handle heel dominant exactly never ever ever okay why", "start": 83.28, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "well that's gonna probably lead to a little bit more digging into the ground Club gets stuck through there yeah that would be my idea yep and it", "start": 92.46, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "can we can still do that with the toe side and what you're referring to is still is the Leading Edge right but the the heel side we've got this spoon over", "start": 100.979, "duration": 18.779999999999998}
{"chunk": "here okay and especially in like heavy rough lies sure you throw a spoon into like that amount of material What's it gonna do twist it it's gonna", "start": 110.34, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "grab it yeah right so what spoon you're talking about this area right here exactly so the hosel the hostel X is that spoon right that cavity so if I have a heel biased Golf Club meaning the", "start": 119.399, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "golf club's sitting like this right and I go into that Medium that spoon grabs so what is this going to do is it going to speed up or slow", "start": 128.7, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "down uh that part would slow down this slows down yeah is this into the turf no so what's it going to keep doing so the toe", "start": 137.459, "duration": 16.861}
{"chunk": "will speed up speeds up so if you like Drop kicking it sure use the heel all day baby fair enough okay also just how how the golf", "start": 145.2, "duration": 18.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "club is designed like as far as heel bias and more toe bias as far as ball speed is concerned with irons", "start": 154.319, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "this is a hotter faster portion over here okay so if I have a golf club even like a tight line sitting down here", "start": 162.599, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "so toes off the ground this is I can't use this any longer because it's off the ground so where where's my ball position going to be sitting heel bias yeah so", "start": 170.099, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "I'd set up where the golf ball would more or less be in the heel so even if I hit one solidly meaning I'm hitting it where I", "start": 180.36, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "set up to the golf ball that's a really hot spot right more towards the heel is hotter in terms of ball speed exactly so", "start": 188.099, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "even if you hit it really solid meaning that we're controlling our bottom out right I'm not hitting it prior to hit that drop kicky shot right I'm not interacting with the turf back here this", "start": 197.159, "duration": 18.421}
{"chunk": "is just tight lie like I'm boom right up into the golf ball got it solid controlling the ball the bottom mount the ball is going to come out way faster", "start": 206.22, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "than if I use the tow side or even the middle portion of the golf club and you like it to come out a little bit more dead around the greens absolutely around", "start": 213.48, "duration": 18.299}
{"chunk": "the greens we do not need speed we don't want speed out of a golf ball generally speaking and again this is a pitch shot video we're not going to be talking", "start": 222.599, "duration": 19.321}
{"chunk": "about chipping in this particular video and well let me ask you how do you like Define pitching versus chipping like how", "start": 232.56, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "would you yeah I mean the dividing line chipping stays on the ground um quicker or gets on the ground quicker", "start": 241.26, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "and it's I mean it's a hard place to divide it I guess but really like uh chipping I'm taking probably less", "start": 248.299, "duration": 15.221}
{"chunk": "than than full Loft I'm taking a gap wedge or a pitching wedge or something like that and getting it on the ground quickly letting it roll sure and pitches", "start": 256.139, "duration": 16.501}
{"chunk": "are soft they're high and soft as kind of the dividing line there you go so and like everybody divides it differently sure so like that's a chip shot that's a", "start": 263.82, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "pitch shot sure well some people are like the distance from the hole if I'm 30 yards out now it's a pitch so there's all these different definitions sure how we're going to", "start": 273.06, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "Define it just in this video is the difference between using Leading Edge and using bounce okay so like how you're", "start": 282.0, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "describing like lower shots yeah well what are you using there are you using Leading Edge type shot are you using a bounce type shot well lower shots would", "start": 290.1, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "be a little bit more Leading Edge there you go and so how how TJ is showing that right is is more just in shaft link", "start": 298.8, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "so if I have more shaft lean right without altering the axis of the of the of the face of the golf club sure right now I've got Leading Edge interaction", "start": 307.199, "duration": 20.1}
{"chunk": "with the turf so that's a Chip Shot how we should Define a Chip Shot got it yes exactly okay so bounces more a pitch", "start": 317.04, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "shot more pitch shot so we're delivering the club more in this respect which we would just call neutral so the shaft is", "start": 324.96, "duration": 15.619}
{"chunk": "just more or less within a few degrees standing straight up and down from a face-on perspective okay okay got it", "start": 332.639, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "okay so we are utilizing the soul slash balance of the golf club okay okay so in essence like if you set it on concrete", "start": 340.139, "duration": 19.421}
{"chunk": "right and set it right down here even like just holding the golf club like you can do this at home if the shaft is straight up and down you'll notice that", "start": 350.88, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "the bounce of the golf club is the only portion of the golf club that has Turf interaction there right the Leading Edge would sit up", "start": 358.8, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "because there's always on every single wedge I don't care how sharp it is or how much bounce you're taking off of it there is still bounce on the golf club", "start": 367.38, "duration": 19.261}
{"chunk": "right even if you have a two degree bounce which like is non-existent like low bounce is like four degrees for like a gap wedge", "start": 377.82, "duration": 17.218}
{"chunk": "and then you get a lob wedge which typically is like between 8 and 12. bounce so we're going to use bounce because we're pitching okay so we're", "start": 386.639, "duration": 16.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "we're bounce bias and to some degree toe bias exactly and what I would encourage players to do", "start": 394.979, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "is mess around with the amount of toe bias that you can get away with the more the better and we'll talk about why but", "start": 403.56, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "from one degree toe bias to a shaft that's standing straight up and down so we're 17 degrees twice right okay so", "start": 412.56, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "that's where we're going to start okay so there's our introduction to the golf club now let's just do this let's go ahead and just hit a couple of", "start": 421.979, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "pitches TJ just so that we have a visual of okay what is a pit shot really looking like here we're not even going to describe it we're just going to hit a couple", "start": 430.259, "duration": 16.599}
{"chunk": "good very nice go ahead and hit one more for us good so what's interesting right there teach and we were just talking about this", "start": 445.919, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "prior yeah like messing around with the golf club that golf club right there was heel biased down like two degrees okay and most people do", "start": 462.3, "duration": 18.541}
{"chunk": "this because when we set up to a full shot that's how the golf club looks is it's a little more healed by us yeah exactly I mean even if you have a golf", "start": 472.02, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "club that is I don't know three degrees toe down you're still going to have shaft deflection which is the bow out of the shaft this way with high speed golf", "start": 480.18, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "golf shots like it bows down so it throws the toe down okay so everybody's gonna see a golf club visually", "start": 489.36, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "where the toe is up slightly I think that looks normal and it looks right okay when it's toe down it looks wrong yeah because of how we always approach a", "start": 497.28, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "golf shot it just feels weird right now I've hit a few toe down and it feels right but but when you're setting up to it it's definitely a strange visual", "start": 506.52, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "exactly and when you're saying it feels right you're speaking about the strikes it feels good like the hit feels right yep so what's really interesting that", "start": 515.64, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "was the drop kicky one yeah I felt it almost kind of grabbing the turf a little bit and when it hit the green it didn't yeah it jet it off it didn't", "start": 523.44, "duration": 20.22}
{"chunk": "have the right exactly exactly so super super interesting so here's how we're going to go about just identifying", "start": 533.22, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "Tobias versus Heel bias we're going to do two things okay always with the lead hand you're gonna hold it in your Lifeline okay okay now showing people", "start": 542.58, "duration": 19.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "this like if you can TJ let's get a little bit closer to the camera so so you can show this okay just hold it like you normally would just with the lead", "start": 552.12, "duration": 15.42}
{"chunk": "hand like for a full swing okay so you'll see how the grip of the golf club for TJ right now is sitting under his pinky pad so you have two", "start": 560.22, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "meaty pads right we got thumb pad and Pinky pad yep simple enough and so that acts almost like is a six finger right here to hold the golf club like the", "start": 570.12, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "pressure of the golf club underneath there okay what I want you to do is let the weight of the club head Center of mass this portion here just fall until", "start": 578.22, "duration": 19.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "that there we go now the grip you'll feel this bounce This falls down and now the pressure of the grip comes into the", "start": 586.86, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "thumb pad here so gotcha okay you're holding it in the lifeline because the lifeline is the space in between both pink or both meaty pads in your hands so", "start": 595.08, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "it sits right in there yeah that's interesting it kind of pulls my wrists into like a little bit more UD exactly a little bit more if I'm going to set up", "start": 603.66, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "that way a little bit more tow bias yep and some people may feel a little bit more in the ud sector but what actually happens which is interesting if", "start": 612.0, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "I tell somebody like I'm holding it normal there to put that into a toe down position they're going to go into more UD here to fake", "start": 621.12, "duration": 20.579}
{"chunk": "that out oh okay so this is just a cheat so the lifeline just gets you there exactly okay plus when you're holding the fingers if you will so the golf", "start": 630.24, "duration": 16.980999999999998}
{"chunk": "club's sitting underneath the the pinky pad there's way more range of motion in the hands which is great for leverage", "start": 639.66, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "okay right like in a full swing we need speed so I have a lever here sure there's a swinging Point here there's a lever down here", "start": 646.62, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "so we have a two I mean there's more than this but in essence we have a system that's a a two lever system which can create more speed think of a", "start": 655.56, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "catapult kind of Zoom right that's how you can throw the rock so freaking far but in this situation we don't need Tons of Speed it'll be more beneficial to", "start": 664.56, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "have a one lever system because it's just simpler got it yep okay so that helps with two things one lever system", "start": 673.44, "duration": 17.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "so there's not as much range of motion now in hinging okay in the lifeline compared to the fingers and two what does it throw to the to the how do we", "start": 682.32, "duration": 18.900000000000002}
{"chunk": "affect the lie here more tow bias there you go more toe bias we've got a shaft that's steeper okay okay so let's start with that let's go", "start": 691.92, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "ahead and hit a couple shots I actually only need one shot but TJ's just holding it in the lifeline of the lead hand you can hold it in the lifeline of the trail hand if you prefer", "start": 699.06, "duration": 18.139}
{"chunk": "if you would like to but no big big deal there now this is really cool that golf golf club was toe down that was slightly", "start": 712.44, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "heavy just like the previous heel by a shot sure but it reacted completely differently when it hit the ground yes yes like completely differently yeah", "start": 721.26, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "because now like if around the greens we want a golf ball that's coming out slow so I can have speed I can be aggressive in the hit yeah if I got it heel down", "start": 730.44, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "and I hit it just a degree heavy you got to be very very precise that way yep the ball is going to come out fast sure okay if I go toe down and have a little bit", "start": 739.74, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "of turf interaction prior to the ball it slows down the toe so I still have Loft on it and it'll come out soft sure soft", "start": 749.64, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "shot like that one so beautiful so we're increasing kind of the margin for error here for most people now you can either pure it or hit it slightly heavy", "start": 757.5, "duration": 19.219}
{"chunk": "still be okay and still be okay okay so let's do one more thing because there's I was saying there's two different ways to really throw the toe", "start": 766.8, "duration": 15.88}
{"chunk": "down sure so that's one it's a must so it's always sitting in the lifeline of the lead hand okay and number two we're going to choke it now all the way down", "start": 774.899, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "almost to the steel okay okay just hit one there so now you're gonna have to get closer to it because it's a shorter Golf Club look at how to down that", "start": 782.579, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "sucker is now that thing's like five or six degrees toe down where the previous one was uh was like a degree or two", "start": 790.68, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "beautiful and watch this it comes out way different going come on now so that's awesome yeah and this is why I want players just", "start": 799.74, "duration": 16.3}
{"chunk": "experimenting with like okay I got a one degree toe down and it's a little uncomfortable just looking at it hit a few shots that way your", "start": 810.06, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "comfort will go up because like you're saying the strike all of a sudden feels nice that golf club was like six degrees toe down and as soon as you hit it what did you", "start": 818.22, "duration": 20.157999999999998}
{"chunk": "do it felt right man yeah okay right yeah exactly okay so that's one okay okay two", "start": 827.339, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "we're gonna always tie this back to like our things that we really believe in and that this is the engine sure it's still going to be the engine okay okay when", "start": 837.3, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "you say this is the engine you're referring to ribs chest thoracic blah blah blah okay here yep got it this is what needs to motor the golf club okay", "start": 846.899, "duration": 18.541}
{"chunk": "okay and we were talking about this a little bit before as well but go ahead and um if you can't just set up facing the camera for us to each and let's", "start": 855.42, "duration": 19.139999999999997}
{"chunk": "motor the club you just hold it the same way you just did okay but let's motor the golf club now without using the chest system and just use the hands and", "start": 865.38, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "arm system to move the golf club back good right there TJ's lead wrist went from a slight amount of extension this", "start": 874.56, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "lead wrist and you'll see the slight cup when TJ's holding on to it now moving into the backswing okay what you just did is now bowed out added flexion into", "start": 883.62, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "this lead wrist loaded the trail risk complex so now let's go ahead and do this again but down the line same action how you're going to motor it", "start": 892.32, "duration": 19.74}
{"chunk": "that club face is dead shut so you just move the golf club from a bounce position at a dress to now a Leading Edge position because", "start": 901.56, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "if you just turn yeah exactly do that from face on so you so we can see that see where the shaft is go ahead and set up again for us so shaft is relatively vertical within a", "start": 911.639, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "few degrees swinging to the backswing okay good now how would you get into the strike there you go great for full swing mechanics not so good for a pitch shot", "start": 921.06, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "okay exactly okay so instead what we're going to do let's go ahead and face the camera again sure and let's do this in slow-mo so folks can kind of see the trickle down from", "start": 930.06, "duration": 18.358}
{"chunk": "engine leaks into the arms leaks into the hands leaks into the club this is going to just sit here for a second as you start to motor this and rotate the", "start": 939.839, "duration": 17.042}
{"chunk": "chest okay keep on going keep on going all the way into the backswing good and what we should see let's do that again we can even improve it just a", "start": 948.66, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "little bit so this angle right here go ahead and start motoring the chest that's what I want to see a slight slight bit because that action right", "start": 957.48, "duration": 16.918}
{"chunk": "there we increased the extension and the lead wrist okay that's what we need that keeps the bounce on the golf club if you were to", "start": 965.519, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "leverage it we might throw a little bit of radial which is just hinging the golf club straight up and down but look at the difference in the flange now it's wide open yeah yeah it's it's still", "start": 974.639, "duration": 19.322}
{"chunk": "Square the Leading Edge shaft and Lead arm are all square with one another go ahead and go down the line now for us okay we'll do the exact same thing", "start": 984.0, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "where we're going to go chest chest chest boom a little bit of radial look at the difference of that Golf Club plus now we want this complex", "start": 991.74, "duration": 21.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "Center of mass Club head outside the hand slightly if we load this more it gets inside the house exactly now", "start": 1001.94, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "we've got Leading Edge okay it's under the plane and now we've got a bad shape for pitching if we're looking to utilize bounce", "start": 1010.22, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "through the strike somewhere in that picture there we go so let's hit some shots here now where the image in your mind is this trickle down", "start": 1019.639, "duration": 17.578999999999997}
{"chunk": "from chest goes into the arms into the hands and what you need to feel in the hands is that action exactly", "start": 1027.679, "duration": 20.921}
{"chunk": "there okay yes beautiful grip motor it with the chest the club head will respond beautiful look", "start": 1037.6, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "beautiful and that one was actually hit yeah still worked out yeah you just hit like", "start": 1053.0, "duration": 16.261}
{"chunk": "kind of a tight lie little pitch that'll catch your attention when you're playing Miss hit it to three feet yeah we'll take that's what we want yeah", "start": 1060.5, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "the peered one went in the hole the mess hit one to three feet okay that's kind of the way we would like to see that happen yeah you need room for error I", "start": 1069.62, "duration": 16.26}
{"chunk": "want another crack at that one absolutely quit messing around and hold it just use the chest it'll leak down into the club head", "start": 1078.2, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "Beauty much better on that one yep exactly and so now we have a period one that went to a foot and a half the Miss hit was three feet we don't have any", "start": 1087.08, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "catastrophic like oh shoot just point it right here or it came off really fast because I'm using heel side yeah that's not how you pitch no that's not", "start": 1094.82, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "how you pitch that way let's mix a game a whole heck of a lot harder yep that's a problem yep okay", "start": 1104.12, "duration": 16.38}
{"chunk": "um last piece here we'll just throw in a bit of Rhythm okay okay so the way that this we're gonna really motor this like in full swings we have energy back and", "start": 1112.34, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "then we have energy forward and Luke bracky likes to talk about it as like a either a one to two a two to four a", "start": 1121.7, "duration": 20.46}
{"chunk": "three to six in full swing so meaning Parts energy in the backswing versus Parts energy on the way through exactly", "start": 1131.78, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "so one two yep kind of like that exactly and what we want to see here is one to one two to two three to three it's the", "start": 1138.98, "duration": 18.659}
{"chunk": "same part back and say part forward so never really adding in more energy in the downswing you're just maintaining the energy you had in the backswing is", "start": 1148.94, "duration": 15.001000000000001}
{"chunk": "that the idea but how people are going to view this is a two to one or one point five so they may even feel like", "start": 1156.74, "duration": 15.419}
{"chunk": "it's like less energy on the downstairs yes exactly so interesting study and I can't remember the group if if I can find it then I will we can absolutely", "start": 1164.36, "duration": 16.261}
{"chunk": "add it in the comments after we post this sure but group did a study on acceleration for PGA Tour players in putting and in", "start": 1172.52, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "short game and found that the golf club was actually decelerating into the golf ball at the strike okay which is super", "start": 1181.039, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "interesting super interesting everybody in their dog goes accelerating you got to swing through it yeah the golf club should swing back and it", "start": 1189.26, "duration": 18.701}
{"chunk": "should fall back forward so this right here this is actually accelerating 9.8 meters per second yeah okay", "start": 1205.64, "duration": 20.319}
{"chunk": "but what what we want like where the golf ball is going to be placed if the club is directly underneath me", "start": 1215.6, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "that's going to be its fastest point where's that golf ball placed in my stance slightly ahead of Center exactly so it would be accelerating accelerating", "start": 1224.96, "duration": 16.381}
{"chunk": "accelerating decelerating decelerating decelerating just based on gravity just based on gravity okay just by letting the golf club from here do this huh", "start": 1233.24, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "so how you're going to manage how far you throw it is based on how much how many parts energy we have in the backswing so how much energy am I", "start": 1242.179, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "putting in here to send this away is it a small pitch that I want to hit one foot in front of me is it a larger pitch that I want to", "start": 1250.52, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "throw maybe a few more yards but we're not changing what we do through here we're only changing how much and it's just gonna fall huh that's the", "start": 1257.78, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "idea right yep exactly so the the idea here is what we will see because we've got a deceleration deceleration pattern", "start": 1267.26, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "happening like if you remember the bowling ball experiment in science class where you held the bowling ball right and you let it go and it goes the other side of the room and here it comes it's", "start": 1275.84, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "going to murder you right it always always stops exactly so we have that plus we have turf interaction okay so it's going to slow down things here okay", "start": 1283.76, "duration": 17.941}
{"chunk": "so how far the golf club swings on this side is going to be shorter than how far it swings back here interesting okay so if I'm here going swing boom", "start": 1292.76, "duration": 20.698999999999998}
{"chunk": "and you can sit like I'm not actively shutting it off it's not this boom no right it's here fall yep", "start": 1303.02, "duration": 15.901}
{"chunk": "here fall cool okay so we'll feel it fall here like if you swung it back and let it fall now the only reason it goes over here is", "start": 1310.64, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "because we're going to continue to turn the chest slightly to some degree so if I wasn't going to turn the chest it would exactly", "start": 1319.82, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "but what a beautiful chest there you go exactly and most people won't even feel like they're rotating the chest much sure", "start": 1328.1, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "you're going to like absolutely every player is going to turn over here okay so it doesn't need to be this active rotate there's just a little bit of like", "start": 1336.38, "duration": 16.679}
{"chunk": "if if I'm hitting it heavy sure just move the center of mass of the ribs slightly forward there you go and now you can control the bottom out I see to", "start": 1344.96, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "the correct degree so you just season it up correctly okay so same picture we're going to hit two shots here sure and I bet you dollars the donuts you can't", "start": 1354.559, "duration": 16.322}
{"chunk": "make one of them oh how about I make them both okay here we go so the intention is to make but it's through this system", "start": 1362.72, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "you're managing the golf club you're managing its energy let's pure this go ahead and knock it in", "start": 1370.52, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "really cool shot though I like the way it reacted yeah for sure absolutely okay now you got your one little like", "start": 1383.84, "duration": 19.398}
{"chunk": "one rep knock it in hard ah see and that's actually a good one to see because that one came out low yeah spinny that was a Groove low on the", "start": 1392.659, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "face so this proves like our our whole Theory here is you can either pure it or hit it slightly heavy we can't hit it", "start": 1405.559, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "thin you're not looking for thin on this type of shot interesting exactly exactly and plus like now we're managing the the", "start": 1414.02, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "angle of attack into the ball sure because if I'm motoring it here what's that angle of attack going to be into the golf ball compared to if I'm motoring it with the chest see how like", "start": 1421.94, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "low the golf club stays yeah interesting so the angle of attack is this really nice shallow angle we're not hitting driving low Spinners spin is the enemy", "start": 1431.12, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "in this shot in this soft in this shot exactly we want the golf ball coming in with a low angle or like a small angle attack like", "start": 1440.84, "duration": 18.179000000000002}
{"chunk": "lower angle of attack here with the shaft kind of straight up and down this looks it should look like you just toss a ball up onto the green and it just goes like a that's a bag of sand is", "start": 1449.659, "duration": 20.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "perfect right it's not this hard spinny cool one it's just a toss shot just a toss shot which makes the game pretty dang easy", "start": 1459.559, "duration": 18.1}
{"chunk": "exactly now now exactly because now the golf ball like once it hits you can visualize it as a pot from that point forward rather than like check check oh", "start": 1468.44, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "spun too early now I have 10 feet or it never spun right and it's just super guessy so it's always just boom runs like a pot boom", "start": 1477.32, "duration": 17.579}
{"chunk": "runs like a pot but in order to get that gotta understand the tool first to some degree right yeah we're toe bias not heel bias", "start": 1486.919, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "here understand and bounce rather than Leading Edge and then understanding how our body mainly the chest leaks down into the", "start": 1495.679, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "arms and hands a little bit of Rd here is totally fine to just Leverage The Golf Club but this is the main motor Bingo you start doing that we're going to have some really really nice like", "start": 1503.84, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "responses out of the golf ball around the green and make short game a heck of a lot easier absolutely game on game on pitching baby", "start": 1513.44, "duration": 23.18}
