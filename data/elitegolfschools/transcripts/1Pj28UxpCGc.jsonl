{"chunk": "faves okay our fave exercises so uh let's pull one out of the Junior Academy first perfect progression one is set up and then we go right into progression", "start": 16.359, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "two which is uh preset preset yes and what are we presetting the impact position that's exactly right the active movement of the", "start": 25.48, "duration": 21.119}
{"chunk": "pelvis is to drop drop yep so hip flexion so all that we're going to do is go back to neutral again as you drop I'm", "start": 34.68, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "going to rotate you boom now we're in Impact okay okay so let's do that again and notice here", "start": 44.079, "duration": 16.041}
{"chunk": "TJ does this really well the club doesn't move that much we'll see like things that screw people up is they think that there should be forward shaft Ling and they just try try to shove this", "start": 52.12, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "forward and it gets wacky the The Hub or the grip should stay in the same general space it will move some but not a ton", "start": 60.68, "duration": 18.198}
{"chunk": "okay okay so if we do that again drop turn Okay so feel where you're at in space mhm all right let's just swing one", "start": 69.759, "duration": 15.562}
{"chunk": "back and go right back there again excellent so couple little cheats like this is a cool drill I love this drill", "start": 77.84, "duration": 18.521}
{"chunk": "mhm cuz there's two things that are involved really we've got a static position that we are presetting hence", "start": 88.96, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "the name preset and then from there what we're able to do is now how do I dynamically move back into that space", "start": 96.92, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "and when I what I'm trying to explain there is like obviously you moved to hit the ball so we have movement but there's", "start": 105.2, "duration": 15.038}
{"chunk": "sequence of that movement when we talk about um just general maps for the golf swing those are like biggest global map", "start": 112.079, "duration": 17.962}
{"chunk": "is the engine lies in the chest or in the ribs okay and the arms are like the wheels all right they are responding to it arms hands and Club respond to what's", "start": 121.24, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "going on in here okay so if you do that again te go ahead and set up you're always setting up clean to the golf ball by the way we're never just like running in there trying to get into preset okay", "start": 129.959, "duration": 17.961}
{"chunk": "now show us preset pelvic drop and chest rotation good now let's do this really slowly the chest is going to start to to", "start": 138.72, "duration": 16.999}
{"chunk": "rotate away from the Target and the arms will stay generally in the same position until they just can't anymore there they", "start": 146.84, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "go so see how the chest moved the instrument and along with the arms and hands eventually right okay go ahead and", "start": 155.319, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "set up again this is a really cool look here so go to preset take your right hand off and put it behind your back this is just a good", "start": 164.159, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "map keep your whole lead arm hand and club right here where it's at in space and just spiral away", "start": 172.72, "duration": 16.519}
{"chunk": "there you go so how it would stay uh so the only real reason that the arms meaning from the shoulder complex down into the elbow complex move is we have", "start": 180.959, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "because we have a dual point of yeah see how you can't get the trail arm on yeah so it it would have to be there yeah so the arms in a way or excuse me the chest", "start": 190.879, "duration": 20.76}
{"chunk": "in a way drags the arms not the hands I'm not talking this yep but it drags the arms along got it got it so it's a cool drill because you can like tie in", "start": 200.48, "duration": 18.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "these like little flavors that are like ah it's the whole darn thing yep the other thing that we'll see with guys that do do preset is they'll go drop and looking all sexy in here and they try to", "start": 210.879, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "just stay here in this space and with my body and they'll just run their arms around and try to like sh all the time yeah that's arm engine okay and we're", "start": 220.12, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "not after arm engine we're not after arm engine we're after chest engine and the arms and hands are responsive to that okay yep the body is supporting the arms", "start": 229.84, "duration": 18.238}
{"chunk": "and hands in the golf swing okay let's do one more of those preset exercise so again running through this beautiful setup pelvic drop and chest rotation at", "start": 238.959, "duration": 20.242000000000004}
{"chunk": "the same time now chest engine and the arms and hands and Club respond right back to the same point in space now this is interesting see how it's not the same", "start": 248.68, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "point in Space Mr extension Central yeah that's a big habit of mine for sure so yeah I think for a lot of our players it is right so what you can do like once", "start": 257.28, "duration": 20.96}
{"chunk": "you go from preset and work from here away it's drop here so I'm dropping here and what's going to tow the club and the", "start": 267.84, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "arms back into it is the upper spiral or the chest so I'm leading with the chest but in this phase here I want to drop", "start": 276.639, "duration": 15.639}
{"chunk": "upper spiral to get better you go exactly and you'll just like tow it into the strike here the spiral line toes it", "start": 284.479, "duration": 16.202}
{"chunk": "so we've got chest good drop upper spiral beautiful what a better rep much better much", "start": 292.6, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "better yeah and just it's cleans things up it feels better in the in there in the hit absolutely okay great so that's preset", "start": 300.4, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "okay preset is great because would you say te like what we just went over there is more uh Armand and Club Centric or", "start": 308.32, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "more chest and pelvic Centric chest and pelvic Centric for sure exactly exactly okay so we still need to train the arms", "start": 316.759, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "and hands with this so that we better understand like how the arms and hands system works in with the body system so this next exercise does that got it so a", "start": 324.479, "duration": 18.122}
{"chunk": "lot of our stuff like the the look in general is is is almost this like infinity look in the hands so what I mean by that t go ahead and just face", "start": 333.8, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "the camera here so if we did this with like the hands Hub grip will stay generally in the same spot but we're going to move this the center of mass of", "start": 342.479, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "the golf club this way oh okay there's our Infinity so if we're set up here the", "start": 350.8, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "back swing would consist of there I'm going to transition and hit a see that shape", "start": 359.919, "duration": 15.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "yep so the club's actually swinging like out away from me yeah and this is this is what's interesting most people will watch this like go ahead and set up to a", "start": 368.28, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "gol like doesn't need to be to the golf ball but just hover it above it and show that same shape now oh that's not low", "start": 377.08, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "left that doesn't look right why does it go low left well if we like pair in what we just did preset that action turns", "start": 385.72, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "into that action there you go do that you're like if you put a lot of energy yeah so you're not disturbing the force it's up here under out there you go", "start": 394.24, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "that's where the force wants to go but people screw it up cuz it goes un they're trying to make it go under but they also want to make it go left and in their mind they're trying to do it with", "start": 403.96, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "their arms so they whack out impact yeah like it's like okay I want to make the club go here I want want it to shallow", "start": 411.28, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "but in my mind's eye it also goes there so I've got one idea that it's going this way and another one it like conflicts yeah it does it really does so", "start": 420.28, "duration": 17.037999999999997}
{"chunk": "and we're always anticipatory uhhuh okay meaning that I want to go here so even though I want a shallow I'm not going to cuz this rules yeah so it like whacks", "start": 428.199, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "everything out so we need to know why it keeps curving uhhuh on this circle circles there's not really lefts and", "start": 437.479, "duration": 15.321}
{"chunk": "rights they just keep curving so you say this a lot you talk about not disturbing this Force right so if we're throwing this Infinity we're not disturbing the", "start": 444.68, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "club shooting out into the right here that's exactly right but the only thing that we're going to do with that is we're going to keep motoring the chest in order to finish the golf swing so", "start": 454.479, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "there's two main themes in this whole video here it's how the arms hands and Club system works and how the body system works got it so how what the", "start": 463.56, "duration": 15.398}
{"chunk": "pelvis is doing what the chest is doing okay so you just hit one aspect which is upper spiral chest rotation and the other aspect is just pelvic drop or hip", "start": 471.199, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "flexion hip hinge whatever yep okay okay so this drill go ahead and set up again for me sure okay the map is especially here in", "start": 479.919, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "the in the early onset of this cuz there's no chest rotation in the back swing so we're just going to hinge this once it goes up then it's going to go", "start": 489.759, "duration": 15.762}
{"chunk": "over okay so you see like gas do this a lot woo and they preset it here yep now we're loading the hand complex it's", "start": 497.12, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "beautiful y but now where's the force going that way there you go it's going down and back so we're not going to disturb that we're going to keep it", "start": 504.4, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "going this way if you did that you'd break your ankle uhhuh we don't want that I don't want to hit here I want to hit there sure so there's an appropriate", "start": 512.839, "duration": 19.722}
{"chunk": "time to drop and turn there you go now we're back into what preset looks like same map but now", "start": 522.36, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "we're tying in these guys okay so we'll call this Infinities okay and in essence all you're going to do is you're going to try to pop me in the nose initially", "start": 530.6, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "right where it's coming right up at me and once it comes at me then we're going to start in the infinity shape and then at the appropriate time now drop and", "start": 539.72, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "turn there you go and you never let that unload get Disturbed in your mind it keeps going this way there that's", "start": 548.12, "duration": 17.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "beautiful okay so really chippy one the initial Infinity is right at me shape it off and add the body at the correct time", "start": 557.0, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "what a cool look so I like what we're doing here cuz it's like preset Foundation now we're going to tie in the hands and Club truly into that yep and", "start": 566.12, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "now all of a sudden we're like kind of in this close like really cool system yes absolutely okay so let's do one more of those Infinity exercises", "start": 575.44, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "okay beautiful and do not disturb the force let it continue to work and unload what a cool look yeah that one felt", "start": 584.959, "duration": 15.241000000000001}
{"chunk": "really good and what's awesome is like now all of a sudden like that's just a bigger see how there's a little bit more energy in that went a little bit further", "start": 592.76, "duration": 15.718}
{"chunk": "but it's still an impact map yeah yeah it's not like it's requiring a lot of like force to it it's just easy flow through the map 100%", "start": 600.519, "duration": 20.44}
