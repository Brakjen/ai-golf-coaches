{"chunk": "hey guys we're back Trev lbec Alex Alex today we're talking about how to stop thinning your irons let's do", "start": 0.32, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "it so how to stop thinning your irons um from our perspective I think there's two main patterns we see when it comes to", "start": 17.24, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "things occurring one that you tell me that you see a lot is a flat shoulder plane so yeah like if you look at someone who you know someone's", "start": 27.08, "duration": 16.359}
{"chunk": "complaints is they thin the golf ball a lot yeah typically what that means is I mean the bottom of their Club is hitting essentially the equator of the golf ball right they're coming in and rather than", "start": 35.559, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "getting underneath a little bit they're hitting like you said right down in the middle you got a beeliner coming at you yeah and from from my experience a lot of the players that I work with you'll", "start": 43.84, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "see that they generally will build a decent back swing right so their left shoulders underneath their chin and when they start to transition this this shoulder will start to flatten out so", "start": 52.48, "duration": 19.839}
{"chunk": "it'll get tall we'll go this way and what you'll notice is like my trail side through my side where my my hips all the way up to my shoulders is very straight", "start": 61.8, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "yes and so as I come here where's the club now the club is now in the air essentially and so that's where you start to see the equator of the golf ball be hit that's the most common thing", "start": 71.36, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "that all see from players is they their failure to get this Trail shoulder kind of in posture and underneath their chin you'll see it fly up into the air and", "start": 81.04, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "then from this point forward the body just has to do what it has to do yeah do that one more time go up to the top and then start halfway down where you get", "start": 90.88, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "like you say the trail shoulder more underneath the chin so you guys can see right he's got some wrinkles on his shirt and you hear us talk about all the time there's the side bend that you hear", "start": 98.92, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "people talk about right right shoulder starting to get underneath the left shoulder the lead shoulder starting to get high but now if we go flat shoulder plane again up to the top we're not", "start": 107.799, "duration": 19.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "going to see a whole lot of wrinkling going on over here and then I'll use this alignment so guys as the visual we're a lot flatter than we need to be", "start": 117.28, "duration": 16.798}
{"chunk": "to get down to this ball so if we add that side Bend again or that posture or that tilt that angle is completely changed that club has a lot better", "start": 125.799, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "chance to hit ball first ground second with some compression versus all ball no ground yeah like when I get when I when I focus on getting the right shoulder to", "start": 134.56, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "replace the left shoulder underneath my chin yeah essentially what happens there for me that's my feel is I'll get to there yes I can feel myself", "start": 144.28, "duration": 17.598999999999997}
{"chunk": "impossable now as I continue to turn my club is now going to interact a little more appropriately with the ground obviously catch golf ball first interact with that Turf a little bit someone who", "start": 152.879, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "thins the golf ball I mean they don't interact with the turf they're ever right and if it is it's very inappropriate they're just kind of barely brushing it and you can tell by", "start": 162.28, "duration": 19.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "the way the golf ball flies not very good yes and then one I see a lot is rather than coming out of their posture from a flat shoulder plane", "start": 171.84, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "perspective they just flat out will stand up so they may s in somewhat of posture yeah they're very vertical so like go up to the top again and where we", "start": 180.879, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "can notice this angle that he has here right just looking at his backline he's got some posture or spine angle you hear people talk about but now from here if I", "start": 189.239, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "had a line on his back line this is going to come off the back line and he's going to get very vertical in transition so yes that does lead to Flat shoulder", "start": 197.48, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "plane but here you can see he lost entire he's standing straight up so again what's that going to do to the club it's a lot higher to the ground and", "start": 205.959, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "he's moved his entire Arc of the Swing yeah and essentially as soon as I get vertical I really can't turn anym if I", "start": 214.84, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "try to miss the golf ball so that's where you see a lot of people will stand up and then they have do what they have to do to throw the arms at it sometimes", "start": 223.76, "duration": 15.278000000000002}
{"chunk": "they catch it out of the middle more than likely catch it right on the equator of the golf ball which results in those thin shots do that again face on facing the camera where you start to", "start": 231.959, "duration": 16.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "stand up right you can't rotate anymore so now what you have to do to throw the arms at it and see right there that club head swinging past his hands that's", "start": 239.84, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "where we get the equator of the golf ball or now the arc is more on the upswing correct so now that we've identified flat shoulder plane or just", "start": 248.0, "duration": 19.319}
{"chunk": "flat out losing posture what are some things we can give folks whether it's movement drills feels whatever to help them go in the right direction yeah I", "start": 257.0, "duration": 16.761}
{"chunk": "think a great Visual and like movement feel for myself is and you can use a Club it's really easy is I'll just put it across my shoulders and essentially", "start": 265.88, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "I'll make my back swing and you'll notice that you know the lead shoulder this this club head is right underneath my chin yeah and so now I mean I I know I'm in a good posture like if you use a", "start": 274.32, "duration": 17.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "mirror or a camera confirm that you're in a good a and good posture and then from here I'm just trying to replace my", "start": 283.08, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "my lead shoulder with my trail shoulder so the club head is underneath my chin right now I want the butt end of the club to replace it so then all I do is", "start": 290.72, "duration": 16.519}
{"chunk": "feel that get it underneath there well that's what creates that side Bend for me like that automatically puts me in side Bend so it just again teaches the", "start": 298.44, "duration": 17.041000000000004}
{"chunk": "body I'm here what do I have to feel to get the the butt end of the club underneath my chin okay I go there that starts to I", "start": 306.88, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "mean that that passively takes care of rotation yes helps you get into more side Bend so you stay in posture a little bit better yes obviously you throw a club in your hand and you", "start": 315.0, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "replicate that that's where ball first Turf second start to compress the golf ball a little bit and your your intera with the ground becomes a little more", "start": 323.0, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "appropriate yeah and what I like about that if you could go face on for the camera same drill right we make our back swing we got the club head pointing at", "start": 331.24, "duration": 15.4}
{"chunk": "what would be the ball the chin is underneath your shoulder and then from there as we go to replace stop right there see how that it", "start": 338.72, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "gets flat but it's not a flat shoulder plane so there is this point where we're at equilibrium if you will and then as he keeps rotating the lead shoulder", "start": 346.6, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "starts to climb the trail shoulder gets underneath the chin and he gets that look this is to not get confused with if we go back to the back swing well he", "start": 355.28, "duration": 17.718}
{"chunk": "says I got to get you know this point at the ground my trail shoulders got to work underneath my chin let me do it and you can see that's excessive tilt and", "start": 363.639, "duration": 17.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "hang back right you can see the pelvis is shot towards the golf ball his head Works back and now it's just this Dusty throw my arms at it and try and make it", "start": 373.08, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "work this very uncomfortable like hanging on my trail side like you can feel like a lot of tension like my lower back starts to like fire immediately cuz you're putting a lot of tension there", "start": 380.88, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "yes and then even down the line do the same thing let's do it correctly and we'll have the folks keep a keep an eye on the mic on your chest here so as you", "start": 389.08, "duration": 15.399999999999999}
{"chunk": "start to rotate correctly the mic is starting to disappear from view for you guys looking down the line now if we tilt excessively and come out of posture", "start": 396.24, "duration": 19.8}
{"chunk": "you guys can still see it so you might say yeah I'm getting my trail shoulder underneath but one you're not replacing it from where the lead shoulder was and", "start": 406.16, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "two you're not rotating cuz this grip's not poed back at the ball and in our case you can see his so that would be an incorrect way of trying to do this okay", "start": 414.52, "duration": 16.359}
{"chunk": "so now we've kind of identified what causes what helps us hit the golf ball thin yes some movement exercises what's a physical drill that", "start": 422.84, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "we could do on the Range to help with this yeah so I love giving people the destination and then through like the movement drill we have for them and just", "start": 431.479, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "in their mind they can arrive or create their own road map of how do they get to the destination so we're going to do a preset impact so what you're going to do", "start": 440.319, "duration": 15.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "number one please do this off a tea so that you can have the station set up and you don't have to keep moving it around the alignment s doesn't have to move all that stuff tea golf ball you're in great", "start": 447.72, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "shape so set up to this golf ball for me and we're going to pretend if you were standing in the middle of a clock the", "start": 456.84, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "golf Ball's 12 six is behind you 3 9 Target side is 9:00 so from here we're going to stand up straight and you're", "start": 463.8, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "going to turn your body towards what feels like 10:00 so it's going to be out towards me exactly so that's about 9 so going bring you back just a little bit", "start": 473.08, "duration": 15.640000000000002}
{"chunk": "10 perfect then from there the right shoulder is going to get a little bit lower to the ball the arms are going to lower and the club's going to go just", "start": 480.84, "duration": 15.079}
{"chunk": "behind the golf ball good now from there we are going to preset his hands and move them onto his Trail leg and we'll show this from face on so you guys can", "start": 487.479, "duration": 20.081}
{"chunk": "see this now I'm going to have a t about 6 in in front or so and from here he's going to make a half swing back swing", "start": 497.8, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "and then his goal is to be able to hit that t after he hits the golf ball so he's going to have to move into his lead side get that shoulder underneath his", "start": 507.24, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "chin and he'll be able to hit that t so now so essentially I'm I'm my brain and my body is focusing on the club hitting the T not the ball yes right cuz at some", "start": 516.839, "duration": 21.200999999999997}
{"chunk": "point you guys the arms have to lower in the downswing it's just a matter of when so now we're trying to get the arms to lower and shoot out towards the target", "start": 527.12, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "rather than straight into the ground prematurely so I'm here uhhuh back good girl now we put that t so far", "start": 536.519, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "out there he's never going to hit it but if you guys could see it was T first and then the divots right after it so he did", "start": 544.44, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "his job I never got to the T but the way that I compressed it and how it shot off the face was I could tell that was appropriate yeah so let's go face", "start": 551.76, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "on and we won't hit it cuz we don't want to hit the folks on whole one and so show me that nice preset so he's going to turn it body to it feels", "start": 561.56, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "like 10 good he's going to work it back and so to get his arms to shoot out towards the te what's he got to do well he's got to rotate his body so then yeah", "start": 570.16, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "when he lets the arms go they're shooting out towards the te versus the incorrect way of doing it if we rocked it back", "start": 579.48, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "again if he lowers the arms prematurely it's chunk City or he's got to stand up and lose entire posture right if I'm if", "start": 587.2, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "I'm going inappropriate here and I try to replace my shoulders and go that way yes now you're on the upswing now you're I mean good luck hitting that golf ball", "start": 595.88, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "yeah right like you said if I go here and I just correct throw the arms down at it no chance chunk City Utah yeah so", "start": 605.2, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "make another back swing for me and start to work it down into delivery right about there so now if he did just let his arms go let me get this", "start": 614.36, "duration": 18.44}
{"chunk": "bowl out of the way let's see where he hits the ground there you go so that's his little tell all how do I get in front of this stick to make my divots so", "start": 623.92, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "you go all right let's keep opening let's keep getting into that lead side that shoulder replaces there we go so again the big thing to remember here", "start": 632.2, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "guys is the AR we have to use our arms so I don't want us getting stuck in this it's all rotation no arms the arms have to lower at some point but it's in", "start": 640.44, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "relation to how much you get into your lead side and how much you're rotating to deliver ball first ground", "start": 649.0, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "second guys thank you so much for watching this video we got more on the way we're also excited to announce we have golf schools in Colorado as well as", "start": 657.04, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "Arizona if you go to our website Elite golf schools of AZ or Elite golf schools of Co you'll find all the golf schools for whatever state you guys are looking", "start": 664.88, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "at we got them uh for the summer in Colorado as well as the fall and the winter here in Arizona as well as", "start": 673.88, "duration": 18.159}
