{"chunk": "today we're going to talk about just general understandings of how to hit quality greenside bunker shots when you throw it in here let's get into it let's", "start": 0.04, "duration": 18.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "go bunkers bunkers how about it you love bunkers I do we sat down we're like hey Tyler what do you want to talk about today he's like man we're going bunkers we haven't done bunkers at all on", "start": 14.28, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "YouTube y they okay let's go do bunkers so here we are y first thing stop hitting it in here", "start": 24.0, "duration": 15.079}
{"chunk": "yeah that would help but when you do we got a solution exactly absolutely but I think one of the the interesting things you hear about this like there's like", "start": 31.16, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "sneaky sneaky topics on this like when announcers are talking on on like PJ tour coverage mhm they'll go like oh these in Bunker PGA Tour players love", "start": 40.6, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "bunkers way more than hit it out of the rough yeah and I think most people if you're a like a a mid-range like intermediate player to higher", "start": 49.6, "duration": 18.279}
{"chunk": "handicapper you hear that statement and you go what yeah how is that possible yeah exactly exactly and um I think the", "start": 58.559, "duration": 17.442}
{"chunk": "the truth be told like this area is actually a heck of a lot easier than like especially rough lies cuz you don't", "start": 67.0, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "like the LIE is pretty much the same every single time like you have different density of sand yeah but you're not having to read like how deep", "start": 75.56, "duration": 15.319}
{"chunk": "the ball is in the rough the grain Direction the type of grass like there's a heck of a lot more that goes into hitting like really a appropriate and good shots out of the rough yeah than", "start": 83.079, "duration": 19.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "there is in here so with that being said I'm going to be hitting some bunker shots uh uh and you're going to be almost like explaining kind of what this", "start": 92.119, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "what this formula is y maybe the first thing that we do is I just hit one just kind of a stocky sounds good and then we'll go from there sounds good okay", "start": 101.159, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "awesome let's see how I do here all right awesome so did okay why so first of all I think he controlled your entry point very well okay you know", "start": 108.159, "duration": 18.483}
{"chunk": "if if we kind of started from from Basics entry point has to be without a doubt the most important thing in bunkers um", "start": 121.96, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "so kind of just want to flash the question back on you how do you control your entry point and what things do you employ to you know to make sure that", "start": 129.8, "duration": 15.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "entry point is is very precise sure so just describing and defining entry point it's where the the the club is is first", "start": 137.08, "duration": 17.799}
{"chunk": "making contact with the sand am I right in saying that with definition of that yep okay cool so the kind of to like go", "start": 146.0, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "down that well just a little bit then we'll come back up the well I think this is a misconception for a lot of players because often times when when we're hear", "start": 155.319, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "hearing about these like little quick fixes in the sand MH people come back here and they're like drawing a line like 2 in behind the golf ball and that's where you should enter in the", "start": 163.72, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "sand and this is like an appropriate entry point Y that is true that that is my entry point here yep however it's", "start": 171.76, "duration": 20.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "very easy to like sneakily interpret that as the bottom out of the Swing right and so well like anytime that I've", "start": 180.879, "duration": 16.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "ever drawn a line back here it always screws people up because they go oh well I have to hit behind it which you do mhm", "start": 190.239, "duration": 16.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "however if I'm hitting behind it but my idea is like I got to get back here to do that now my low Point sucks right and we'll hit these shots that are horrible", "start": 198.4, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "I'm either going to leave it in the bunker cuz I like hit back here and the ball's all the way up or I'm going to bottom out and climb and I blade it and", "start": 207.28, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "both stin out of the bunker so truly the bottom out point is probably somewhere up in here but then the exit point is", "start": 214.4, "duration": 20.079}
{"chunk": "right in there so this becomes our divot pattern in the sand where I've got entry point bottom out exit Point gotcha", "start": 223.439, "duration": 20.241}
{"chunk": "gotcha so so with that being said where would you put the ball position on kind of a stock shot in order to accomplish that okay so that that's", "start": 234.84, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "super interesting as well right because Mo most of the time we'd go okay well I'm going to put my this is the bottom out Point that's right underneath my sternum blah blah blah yeah you never", "start": 243.64, "duration": 17.879}
{"chunk": "see a PJ Tour player hop in there like that no it's always in the front of their St forward so there's some like counterintuitive type of information", "start": 252.72, "duration": 19.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "going on right here we got bottom out up here but you see every single PJ Tour player and the ball is up in their stance like right now it's up in the", "start": 262.16, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "front half of my stance right so wouldn't that make my bottom my bottom out here y that' be my entry point here y okay so we got problems yeah confusing", "start": 270.199, "duration": 21.041}
{"chunk": "exactly confusing so I think one of the things like in order to control this this bottom out like the this overall map of this is the same in like uh", "start": 280.52, "duration": 21.72}
{"chunk": "distance wedges and kind of like longer is or higher energy pitches like flop shots have higher energy right yeah like a 30 yard pitch", "start": 290.8, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "you'll see this on almost every single PGA Tour player two where as the club swings away their head starts to move Target side right so as I swing the golf", "start": 300.28, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "club away now I'm going to float in this space it's almost like a little lateral lunge yeah like I'm not rotating at all but everything's moving this way well", "start": 309.72, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "when I do that where's my bottom out go moves forward heck of a lot more forward yep and then even in the forward Direction swing as I'm unloading the", "start": 317.479, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "golf P sure as heck I'm not going to work away from it if anything you can continue to move forward even more right yeah like the number one killer anything", "start": 325.44, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "around the Green's going to be backing up 100% if anything so you want to create the environment where where you can actually move forward through the", "start": 334.0, "duration": 15.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "strike and still get your bottom out in the right spot exactly so I think if we go all right well there's generally going to be more or less the middle of", "start": 341.44, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "my stance and some players will do this like highle bunker players while they'll preset here on the left I'm a fan of that but kind of not as well it's like", "start": 349.12, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "in movement we want space to move into and we want to move into that space right so to learn this you almost might start more biased into the trail side to", "start": 359.16, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "feel pressure here like right now I got like I don't know 7030 sure pressure but if I swing it back now I'm going to be able to move forward during that time", "start": 367.479, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "and control the bottom out because the the center mass of my ribs my head whatever you want to look at yeah is moving Target bias yeah so let's hit one like that just to kind of play around", "start": 375.84, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "with so there's there's middle of the stance generally I'm going to actually start here about 70 30 but now as soon as I make my back swing I'm starting to", "start": 384.84, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "move forward there and now you'll see like every time like now now I can control where that entry point is a heck", "start": 392.28, "duration": 15.161}
{"chunk": "of a lot easier yep yay right y you like I like I like too okay okay so that's entry point yep that's entry point let's", "start": 399.24, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "let's talk about how to control um height in trajectory okay and I got some ideas for you I love ideas so um first", "start": 408.24, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "thing I want to talk about when we're discussing height and trajectory is kind of angle of attack and kind of plane of", "start": 416.199, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "the golf club okay so if we want to hit it High My Philosophy would be to get the golf club as steep as possible and", "start": 423.84, "duration": 15.957999999999998}
{"chunk": "kind of slice underneath that golf ball as much as we can with speed so we're talking from this line we're getting a club head up and down on this plane", "start": 432.319, "duration": 19.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "rather than the golf club that's in here correct I think trackman we'll have to find out exactly cuz we're I'm not crazy familiar with", "start": 441.8, "duration": 15.639}
{"chunk": "with trackman may maybe you are we use foresight here but they they talk about I think it's like vertical attack yeah and it's from like just generally where", "start": 449.56, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "the club head is at about belt level so the club could be back here and working into the golf ball or the club could be back out here and working into the golf ball that's kind of what we're talking", "start": 458.36, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "to yeah okay yeah and you know additionally if if we get the golf club a lot steeper yep um in takeaway and", "start": 467.039, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "down into the strike yep that's going to reduce face rotation that's also true so the more I can reduce face rotation the", "start": 474.96, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "more Loft I'm going to have to use effectively right and you'll see when Tyler does that like his unload like if you swing it into the back there he it's", "start": 483.0, "duration": 19.599}
{"chunk": "a highly UD unload meaning the club is is exiting this way you'll see how the golf club stays out in front of them that way we often talk about like in full swing how the golf club would go", "start": 492.319, "duration": 16.882}
{"chunk": "back in here that's like killer and bunkers yeah right candy y um for the particular shot especially that you're talking about so there's a UD load and", "start": 501.8, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "then from here you'll see where this wrist condition is in the in the lead wrist if you do that from face on we can both kind of do it like we've got this", "start": 510.159, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "UD unload and then from here as the golf club continues to pitch and unload look how much extension there is in that lead wrist shafts totally different like how", "start": 517.64, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "am I going to hit it low from there yeah no chance that's cool yep yep and I think the other cool thing in doing this that matches up really well with what", "start": 526.48, "duration": 16.599}
{"chunk": "we're talking about in the center mass of the ribs the further forward this goes like let's say I'm in here and I move all the way up here to get into", "start": 535.16, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "that golf ball by there's no chance I can get into it if I just handle drag y I've got to get this thing out yeah to get there yeah which is almost", "start": 543.64, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "counterintuitive as well right I'm going forward most people go oh you're going to hit it low nor I'm actually going to hit it high right if I go back to control the bottom out I've got to shove", "start": 551.92, "duration": 17.799}
{"chunk": "the handle forward I got Leading Edge problems no bounce shaft Lan all kinds of crud there yep right yep okay cool so", "start": 560.519, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "we're going to hit a higher shot kind of getting back on topic here y um you do anything different when you when you stand to it or set to it as well like", "start": 569.0, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "posture wise yeah I'll I'll stand a little bit closer to it y um just so I can get the shaft a little bit more vertical that also reduces face rotation", "start": 576.399, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "additionally that's going to help me even get steeper than an original stock setup exactly exactly and what what you", "start": 584.68, "duration": 16.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "can really take a look at here when Tyler's describing this is the center of mass of of his of his being compared to where the golf club is is a", "start": 592.76, "duration": 19.959}
{"chunk": "heck of a lot taller there compared to if he started to walk away from it a little bit and now sit now all of the sudden see how much more shallowed out", "start": 602.079, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "the center of mass compared to uh the golf club is here where the golf ball would be lying that's a totally different map there okay so if we're", "start": 611.079, "duration": 17.322000000000003}
{"chunk": "hitting this High one if this is stock right stock setup all we're doing is getting in there closer to it yep maybe a little bit taller and and the and the", "start": 619.32, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "shaft is going to pitch just a little bit more because of that yep okay but then we're still feeling the same like I'm going to be going forward and as I continue to go forward I'm really", "start": 629.32, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "unloading the golf club here y okay beautiful let's take a look it comes out really soft like spin or too right yeah heck of a lot easier y", "start": 637.079, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "so if we wanted to do the opposite like a lower kind of run out shot yep cuz the other thing that that will do is like that'll spin a hell of a lot more yes", "start": 646.6, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "yes okay that's kind of fun yeah zesty all right so so totally new situation we just hit it like let's just say we just", "start": 654.079, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "flew at 20 ft let's say on this one we have to fly at like 30 to 50 ft mm so you're going to get further away from the ball okay and you're going to allow", "start": 662.24, "duration": 21.081}
{"chunk": "the golf club to go in more of a Roundy pattern around you versus vertical that's going to increase face rotation it's also going to shallow out shallow", "start": 672.92, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "out the divot yep fire the golf ball out absolutely there can almost be like a little bit of a sit here as well and all of that now starts to", "start": 681.68, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "move we're back okay we're back in we had a a a Eager Beaver mower that just had to mow take care of it he did a", "start": 690.279, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "wonderful job yeah looks way different um all right so we were just talking about uh or or getting ready to talk about um this longer kind of blasty type", "start": 699.959, "duration": 19.321}
{"chunk": "of a shot like the first one is more of like a higher launch like definitely softer shots so like kind of shortsighted situation probably right", "start": 709.88, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "right this is more like long- sided situation you almost want to toss it out in the middle of the green and it kind of like skids a little bit might run out some that kind of a shot yeah and and", "start": 718.72, "duration": 17.078999999999997}
{"chunk": "and you need this shot because you know if you're hitting into into a part five you go okay that bunker with green to work with looks pretty good yeah and then you hit it in there and you're like", "start": 727.279, "duration": 18.720999999999997}
{"chunk": "oh wow how do I hit a 60ft bunker shot exactly and I think the key is like I mean even in like chipping pitching", "start": 736.0, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "bunker shots you're not wasting green cuz if you're onedimensional now all of a sudden it's like oh my gosh 60 ft I'm going to toss it all the way there yeah", "start": 743.72, "duration": 18.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "uh no good so um prior shot we're right on top of it faces pretty open this one we're working away little bit more sit so that Center of MK goes down now we're", "start": 752.199, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "we're just set up like you were talking about how the golf club's going to work around me more rather than this vertical type of type of a look y so from right", "start": 762.639, "duration": 15.520999999999999}
{"chunk": "in here same mechanics apply just a little bit of a different visual of the golf club swinging around still got to control my entry point my low point and", "start": 770.16, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "the exit so still working for it all those same mechanics apply it's just a little different shape in the golf club yep so we're right in here more around", "start": 777.8, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "me now I can toss it out a heck of a lot further yeah super firm sand that thing came out fast yeah okay so beautiful", "start": 785.6, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "beautiful beautiful um big big items here I think that we almost like kind of skipped over in a way mhm like wedges", "start": 793.8, "duration": 17.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "especially like I got a 58 what do you got same 58 y what's your what's your bounce I got eight I I got eight too so what that's", "start": 803.36, "duration": 18.798}
{"chunk": "simply meaning is is the beveled edge here this rounded Edge and its neutral setting so from face on if the shaft were straight up and down the golf club", "start": 812.399, "duration": 18.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "already comes designed with 8 degre of Bounce yeah now every shot that I'm hitting I'm throwing the face open which is going to increase the bounce", "start": 821.519, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "substantially yeah but you don't have to do that so even if you're like more newer into bunkers just need something that gets out gets on the green and like", "start": 829.399, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "one one shot by no means do you have to throw the face wide open from here you could actually set the face Square ball's still slightly up like you'll see", "start": 838.839, "duration": 18.281}
{"chunk": "where where my my um middle my stance really is and where the starts yeah but from here you can still hit the same type of shot by as I'm swinging the golf", "start": 847.759, "duration": 20.041}
{"chunk": "club away I'm moving slightly forward continuing to move forward through the strike but I'm unloading the golf club in this manner and that was that UD to", "start": 858.32, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "lead wrist extension type of a map yeah so so essentially you're you're adding Loft to the strike by MH UD by the", "start": 866.68, "duration": 20.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "release versus just opening it y to begin with so essentially the shaft leans slightly backwards strike to add", "start": 876.8, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "bounce and Loft 100% 100% And when you're doing that we're we're still have um there's a couple key components just", "start": 884.959, "duration": 16.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "in like how the Dynamics of the golf club through the strike we're still hitting down on the ball y like like what Tyler just showed it's easy to think that like okay I need this to go", "start": 893.759, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "here an easy cheat is just a lean back on it so I can show this it's it's not that it's this combo of moving the ribs forward while at the same time unloading", "start": 902.92, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "it in that manner that's the that's the look and really what should happen like we also won't see anybody on tour where the golf club is actually leaning back", "start": 912.24, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "it's just when I've moved forward that shaft is straight up and down ah so right over that kind of that line that you drew there but your whole Stern is", "start": 920.6, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "actually forward exactly so all that I've really done is I've move as I've moved forward but see how the golf club is still in its its neutral setting here", "start": 929.48, "duration": 15.918999999999999}
{"chunk": "for this particular shot so if I'm right in here again away forward that's the delivery that I can throw the club into the sand withd and that's such an easy", "start": 937.56, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "like no-brainer shot like that was the dumbest thing ever so easy so easy right so like you can absolutely start to get", "start": 946.56, "duration": 17.558}
{"chunk": "into um and I think this will be like a a maybe a topic for like an additional video in Bunker play just more advanced", "start": 955.199, "duration": 15.642}
{"chunk": "topics in bunkers yeah because like path the attack angle how the golf club is open or or shut com based on what kind", "start": 962.56, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "of lie you have you can do a lot in the bunkers for sure but to start off with I mean shoot you got a golf club that's already 58 or 60 degrees in Loft it's", "start": 971.92, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "not like you need to like really work that hard to get it up out of the I mean I've got a pretty hefty lip here yeah which intimidates a lot of players and they'll run it right right into the lip", "start": 980.6, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "because they just don't understand how to use the instrument we need a downward angle of attack right okay that's really primarily done by the center mass of the", "start": 989.519, "duration": 15.4}
{"chunk": "ribs moving forward cuz now I've got my bottom out up here so it's going to be working downward into the into the sand okay okay uh by the way on that downward", "start": 996.88, "duration": 17.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "look it's not handle down we're not saying that the handle is getting shoved into the sand we're saying that we're actively unloading and if I do that with", "start": 1005.6, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "this UD to extension release notice how the center of mass of the club is going down down down down down yes so so I I want to bring something up so what I see", "start": 1013.279, "duration": 17.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "like most of um kind of beginning students players who aren't very good in the sand they'll they'll try to put a ton of energy um into the grip into the", "start": 1022.12, "duration": 19.839}
{"chunk": "handle versus a ton of energy out towards the center of mass so when you just said you know putting a lot of load", "start": 1032.079, "duration": 15.280000000000001}

{"chunk": "backs with quite a bit of energy feeling energy go in and out out here versus trying to pull the hands through and", "start": 1048.48, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "push forward with with the trail side that's like the biggest fall that we see yeah we see that all the time right and like everybody has their own like little isms that they have based on what", "start": 1057.28, "duration": 17.761}
