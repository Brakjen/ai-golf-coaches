{"chunk": "rotating your hips what's the secret Jackson oo it's actually kind of not what you think what do you think thinking less rotation of the hips less", "start": 14.92, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "rotation of the hips so I think a big thing that we're seeing kind of Tau not to say there's anything wrong with it maybe in our system it's not a", "start": 23.16, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "preference big thing we're being seeing tau is very active rotation of the hip complex active rotation of the pelvis trying to twist these hips open through", "start": 30.92, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "the strike and let me get this straight you're saying don't do that right correct yes so so what should we do instead so my thought process for me and", "start": 39.36, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "a feel for me but how we can picture it is more so of an internal rotation of this femur so I'm turning into this leg", "start": 48.6, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "here and getting my upper body my upper SP spiral rotating through first versus allowing this to now externally kind of", "start": 57.68, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "rotate this yeah cuz cuz when you when you externally rotate the femur like that essentially you're breaking that relationship of the Spiral line right so", "start": 67.28, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "now we've we've moved all of the active rotation into the hip complex and now I'm probably going to have to stall out and and kind of thrust down here at the", "start": 76.479, "duration": 16.081}

{"chunk": "active movement of the pelvis is simply to just drop straight down drop straight into the ground so if you just imagine a straight line coming out of your tailbone or your sacrum we just want", "start": 101.56, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "that that to go straight down in the ground yep that's all the pelvis yep that's all the pelvis really does is is just drop and then the movement of the", "start": 110.64, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "upper spiral or the chest or the ribs or whatever you want to call it right that eventually is going to pull on the", "start": 119.84, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "pelvis around yes yeah now I know a lot of people are going to watch this and say but but coach I see in all highle swings a separation right of the hips", "start": 127.2, "duration": 21.401}
{"chunk": "from the upper body so so the reason that we see that separation is because as we are stretching our arms up into the right here as we're creating a big", "start": 138.0, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "stretch across the arm lines and the spiral lines what we're doing is we're dropping into the ground as that happens as I drop you're going to see some", "start": 147.12, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "separation right you're going to see the appearance that the hips are opening before the chest opens that is not", "start": 155.64, "duration": 15.879000000000001}
{"chunk": "something that we want to like not see right correct but I think what we're really after is what is the intention that actually creates the right pelvis", "start": 163.519, "duration": 16.56}

{"chunk": "movement that we're after no um so Jackson why don't you hit one for us I I just want you to kind of demonstrate this breaking with the lead leg so", "start": 181.4, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "essentially you're turning the upper spiral into the lead leg can you kind of show us what that might look like yeah", "start": 190.4, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "and a good feel that I would say I kind of have is is we've posted on on social as well of kind of these stepping drills", "start": 198.08, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "stepping forward so in a sense that's kind of what I'm feeling is I step into that lead side or I kind of Stack into that lead side with my joints and now", "start": 206.56, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "I'm feeling tension in this leg I cuz I put inevitably put Force into the ground okay and I want to almost feel like I", "start": 216.159, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "maintain that as I rotate and let everything release okay so cool that is what I'm trying to execute here once you send one you hit driver", "start": 223.92, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "about as good as I've seen anyone head driver so okay now you tell me like like decent", "start": 232.56, "duration": 15.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "one right yep did you actively rotate your hips I tried to actively well not actively but tried to rotate him as little as I possibly could that's", "start": 243.36, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "interesting right like I thought you were about to say you actively shut your hips right almost almost that's the Sensation that he's creating there like", "start": 252.56, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "he's preventing the hips from rotating open too early he's actually keeping the pelvis and the hip complex shut for longer which then pretty much allow you", "start": 260.68, "duration": 18.48}

{"chunk": "ripping a driver because they've whacked out all of that ability with this early and active hip rotation right so let's go ahead and see one more like that up", "start": 286.28, "duration": 15.681}

{"chunk": "we especially with driver we go oh I want to hit this harder so we go I'm going to rotate harder ah to hit it yes", "start": 319.24, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "but if we're thinking of how a wheel spins the center of that wheel The Hub is spinning slower than the tread so why", "start": 327.639, "duration": 17.481}
{"chunk": "do I need to go harder here to get this out faster probably don't you don't no no so you're you're getting the energy out of the club head with this feel as", "start": 335.6, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "well like actually fully releasing the club um and and when people you know early active rotate the hips that's their map they actually can't get the", "start": 345.4, "duration": 16.799999999999997}

{"chunk": "yourself to move the upper spiral into the hip complex yep yeah that's actually a big sensation a lot of people can feel", "start": 402.28, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "is how shut to get yourself on the opposite Spectrum if you're somebody that is an active thrower over the hips an active fire is how shut can you stay", "start": 410.759, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "and how long can you stay there interesting you'll just start to find new ways of of relating to this movement it feels athletic it feels athletic this", "start": 421.039, "duration": 16.68}
