{"chunk": "what can I control each wedge at to kind of have a consistent ball flight consistent Spin and kind of where does that golf ball go from there so you", "start": 160.8, "duration": 15.639}

{"chunk": "more what I'd like to see this would be your first rep of the day by way here we go the ice cold baby hit uh let's hit us", "start": 203.799, "duration": 16.242}
{"chunk": "just um kind of a not a stock wedge but something that's kind of 34y or whatever what club do you have I got wed you got lob so 60 yeah 60 60\u00b0 so what are we", "start": 211.64, "duration": 18.479}

{"chunk": "ice cold so that's so good God I just I wish people could actually see that ball it's", "start": 229.72, "duration": 16.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "so good that and like it it's it's awesome and like one of the things that I want you to notice go ahead and hit us one more here Alex is the Cadence in", "start": 243.319, "duration": 19.402}
{"chunk": "which Alex swings wedges and this is why like I think he he thinks on full Full swings full wedges he's going at 80%", "start": 252.48, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "like that ball is so flighted just such a dart let's go into kind of some specifics of this like how folks can try it so so so number one we're going to", "start": 263.24, "duration": 17.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "hit on this like main topic a ton we need super super low speed in the rotation of the chest because the more", "start": 271.32, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "energy somebody's putting in here to rotate and I've got a golf club that's that's loaded back here as I rotate it's going to spit energy out of the golf", "start": 280.8, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "club yep and so that unload right now the actual loft of the golf club at the strike is heightened cuz the shaft isn't", "start": 288.759, "duration": 15.562000000000001}
{"chunk": "leaning forward so that may be good for irons up into driver and like longer full full shots and even if you're trying to hit like a special like if you", "start": 296.96, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "got like a front pin and you got to stop one like that's I mean that's the that's what you need to do yeah let's just talk about shaft Lan first like a really", "start": 305.16, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "simple way to to look at shaft Lan Alex if you could just face the camera and go ahead and set up so at a dress we're in an unloaded position in the hand complex", "start": 313.24, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "sure okay right like super soft in here relatively soft in here the shaft is leaning forward a couple of degrees it's nothing ridiculous right and it's not", "start": 322.4, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "maybe neutral where it's zero it's leaning forward forward a couple of degrees yep well if we just did this go ahead and keep your chest facing here just picked it up and put it back over", "start": 332.28, "duration": 18.439}
{"chunk": "here that would be a loaded position okay would you agree yes like you can probably feel it in the hand in like forarm complex the golf club's loaded up blah blah blah blah blah yep", "start": 341.6, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "so let's just take this structure of the arms hands and club and turn it back into the strike utilizing the chest so you going to keep this structure the", "start": 350.919, "duration": 15.56}
{"chunk": "same and just turn turn turn ah yeah now all of a sudden we have shaft Lan huge there you go so a good map if we go back to neutral again is at", "start": 358.479, "duration": 19.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "some point in the back swing you can go ahead and turn now let's turn in the back swing the golf club gets loaded well from here we just want to motor", "start": 368.319, "duration": 17.522}
{"chunk": "this complex back into the strike just using chest so all you're going to do is drop a bit and turn and now all of a", "start": 376.68, "duration": 15.078999999999999}
{"chunk": "sudden we get in the same look okay so all we're doing is really loading the golf club we're leveraging it in the back in the back swing and then from there just looking to turn that into the", "start": 384.319, "duration": 18.441}
{"chunk": "strike yeah so let's hit let's hit one out there just feeling that as I throw your golf clubs don't mind me okay still like kind of that 34y one", "start": 393.72, "duration": 21.479}
{"chunk": "but that's the picture in the mind good I feel nice it does feel nice I also got a little bit extra distance", "start": 403.84, "duration": 16.078}
{"chunk": "there with it too so what's interesting the extra distance comes because we have less Loft all of a sudden yeah like if I load it and then I", "start": 416.28, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "just motor it in like that 60\u00b0 golf club is no longer 60\u00b0 you turned it into a sandwich yeah like or even less like 50", "start": 424.24, "duration": 17.559}
{"chunk": "oh let let's do that one more time go ahead and set up to it okay we're just going to swing it into the back swing again kind of a 3/4 look okay good the only thing that I I", "start": 433.639, "duration": 18.802}
{"chunk": "want players to really manage and this is kind of the weird thing this is a theme for us at all times is if you just start to drop and", "start": 444.759, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "turn where that Golf Club wants to go and you're really yeah it wants to go over yeah exactly so if you're a good player you're going to recover with just", "start": 452.599, "duration": 15.761999999999999}
{"chunk": "side bin to tilt it under and now we got big issues no good um so we've got to manage the tool at the same time so if", "start": 461.16, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "we go back up to the top again so as you're dropping and turning we need the center of mass of the club need to go behind it needs to go behind some so go ahead and start dropping and turning and", "start": 468.72, "duration": 17.360000000000003}
{"chunk": "so now we've got it in a delivery position that's nice it's back here so now as I keep working this down behind look at the difference in the angle of", "start": 477.68, "duration": 16.599}
{"chunk": "attack that I'm going to have here it's still going to be a shallow angle of attack shallow if the club were up here if we didn't organize it yeah this angle", "start": 486.08, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "of attack is a heck of a lot more severe the downward angle is going to be crazy yep that shallows it so we're managing the same the angle of attack yep so if", "start": 493.199, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "you if you're a guy that's hitting these right and you're going okay I'm going to drop and turn and you can just sense like dude I'm just taking free pelts", "start": 502.319, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "right and this is like the poor man's way of looking at angle of attack which is fine like most folks aren't going to go out with like trackman flight scope whatever big heavy technology people", "start": 510.919, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "don't have access to all those numbers yeah you just need to manage these two things like one okay this is easy to see", "start": 520.0, "duration": 15.761000000000001}
{"chunk": "that I've got the golf club leverage sure I'm going to motor here so now I have less Loft and I'm keeping the load correct right I'm not letting this go", "start": 528.04, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "yeah and I mean the the the load you're not letting it go due to the rate of what we're rotating at exactly and the only other thing that you just again", "start": 536.68, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "need to manage and when I'm saying manage like the the analogy that typically we use is like how we're seasoning up our steak right if you look", "start": 545.04, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "some peppercorns on your steak that's great but there's a point where there's too many on there and you're like I I want some steak with my pepper now right", "start": 553.92, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "so it's not that you need to get crazy with shallowing the golf club or having the golf club get behind you some people need that some people really don't so go", "start": 561.88, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "ahead and hit us a couple more Alex if you could just these like little 70 yers", "start": 571.0, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "beautiful okay so now let's do this same overall pattern in your mind but let's go to full now okay so", "start": 578.8, "duration": 21.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "this will be a full stock if you will lob wedge I don't hit many of these yep", "start": 590.8, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "that's so good so that ball about 90 that ball is awesome and made a super interesting comment before hitting that shot I don't hit too many of these why", "start": 603.36, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "don't you hit too many of those with lob wedge you've got 60\u00b0 of Loft and it's it's one of those yardages where if I do", "start": 612.92, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "need to hit this full uhuh I've probably got a yardage with my sand wedge that I can control a little bit better and I bet dollars to Donuts you're hitting", "start": 620.56, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "Sand Wedge so you can keep the ball I want the ball flight a little bit lower exactly I I just I feel like when I take full Swings with my wedges mhm it's just", "start": 629.44, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "a little out of control you know the speed gets a little quick the timing's maybe just a little bit off but I'm really paying attention to how much can", "start": 637.32, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "I control the golf ball as it flies and as it lands on the green so you're talking about this word control control with a wedge like we hear about driver", "start": 645.0, "duration": 17.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "all the time we want High lunch low spin bums nobody talks about wedges wedges we want low launch High spin it's the", "start": 653.44, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "opposite that's where a lot of people are like why would I launch my wedges lower that's not going to produce as much spin it actually does exactly that", "start": 662.8, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "exactly that it's the total opposite of what most people think of most people think of low launches like this Stinger bullet that just like right that's not", "start": 670.76, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "how a wedge responds like that one right there is so cool because good wedges the ball looks this is so hard to explain", "start": 678.959, "duration": 18.242}
{"chunk": "the ball looks aggressive and soft all at one time it's like a way like it's here but when it lands it's looks like a", "start": 687.76, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "sandbag right it's not this like big high floaty one that just floats all over the place so when you're saying out of control out of control number one is", "start": 696.959, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "going to be vertical launch that's way too high yes while at the same time the spin is going to go down because of that and now you it's this knuckle ball that", "start": 705.88, "duration": 15.879000000000001}
{"chunk": "floats and it's in the air for way too long your proximity is going to be horrible that way let's touch on this one last thing this would be a good", "start": 713.839, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "place to kind of finalize this video is we're we're talking about angle of attack but when we're speaking about angle of attack like when you see that on", "start": 720.92, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "any uh any technology they're talking about the angle of attack at the moment of the ball right right right there so", "start": 730.0, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "if I if I'm bottoming out here right I'm going to be climbing into the ball so that angle of attack is going to be high sure so if I got a golf club that's", "start": 738.72, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "working up and I skinny it that ain't going to work like that so we got to manage the bottom out here Y how are you managing the bottom out I'll be honest", "start": 747.079, "duration": 17.161}
{"chunk": "as soon as you asked that I was like I don't really know yep that's usually my answer to a lot of things trolling low point with a wedge yep I'm it's it's got", "start": 756.12, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "to be in the speed of the Swing once I get a little too quick that's where low Point gets all out of control for me so how Alex is speaking by the way is how", "start": 764.639, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "we would like every single player to speak because it's so funny there's just like bell curve like you learn learn learn all these things and then once you get like a really accomplished golf", "start": 773.16, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "swing it it turns out to be like you start talking like a 30 handicapper again I'm trying to like control my rhythm it's like these super like", "start": 781.92, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "regular things to say but we got to understand where those come from yeah so you say this really awesome deal which is like I'm managing like how much energy I put in it I'm keeping energy", "start": 791.56, "duration": 20.319}
{"chunk": "low okay well if we look at at at uh low Point go ahead and set up in here for us and we'll just do this together we'll just hug the club good posture", "start": 800.8, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "we've talked about back chain dominance again you can stay right there back chain dominance is simply my pelvis being behind the the center of mass of my ribs so at a dress obviously we're in", "start": 809.72, "duration": 20.079}
{"chunk": "back chain dominance right now yep well this is why we want like especially with wedges you can start to understand this idea of flexion in the hips and rotation", "start": 819.279, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "in the in the thoracic or in the ribs in that when I drop and I turn to go over here see where my head's", "start": 827.959, "duration": 18.0}

{"chunk": "pelvis is still in flection behind the center mass of my ribs like right now still in back chain yep we just need to see it in 3D space the 3D space is", "start": 845.639, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "rotation so I'm rotating there's back swing if I drop and turn the chest now all of a sudden the center mass of my ribs is up ahead of where the golf ball", "start": 853.279, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "would correct and so when you say manage speed I sure can't do that with speed because if I turn hard here it's going to pull on the pelvis that's where the", "start": 862.88, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "spiral line goes and it look like this more that's why driver extends earlier because I have more energy in the system sure well wedges we sure as heck don't", "start": 871.04, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "want to do that n because now we're just sending Moon balls out there for a lot of different reasons okay okay so like overall theme and I know we're only", "start": 879.72, "duration": 16.319}
{"chunk": "hitting like a few different shots like we were just talked about 3/4 yeah and 100 um I'm not I don't know about you", "start": 888.12, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "but like I'm not a huge fan of like this idea of like 9:00 to 3:00 with every single wedge and then 10 to 2 and like doing that because it's so like", "start": 896.16, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "dependent on energy I could do 9 to three firm or I could do 9 to three really lazy and I'm going to get a way different look so I would prefer more", "start": 904.959, "duration": 19.081}

{"chunk": "ball compared to 15 it's the same system but we almost want to go okay there's 40 yards I know my system what's the amount of energy that I'm going to put in so if", "start": 923.12, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "we've got this idea of of just that like that's a great place to start um I think the last thing to throw on here is when", "start": 932.519, "duration": 20.521}
{"chunk": "we're talking stock shots we need to go to maximum energy in the ribs until we get to a ball that's that's outside of", "start": 942.56, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "the launch Zone yeah so paying attention to where theall launches and then kind of keep I mean that's just a mental note to make everyone's going to be a little", "start": 952.199, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "bit different too well a little bit but those numb a little bit Yeah and they'll be vastly different with what they actually feel person to person but the", "start": 959.959, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "numbers should be very similar yeah like the ball with lob wedge on stock shouldn't be above 32\u00b0 of launch which is going to be crazy low", "start": 967.6, "duration": 19.72}
{"chunk": "for a lot of folks cuz most folks I like they're going to launch it at 45\u00b0 so 32 is like what but they'll probably end up", "start": 977.24, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "actually hitting at the same distance if not further with way less energy yeah and then we get to Sand Wedge like you said like your pitching wedges an", "start": 985.36, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "iron so it responds a little bit different but but Sand Wedge will be somewhere in like the 28 maximum launch gap wedge will be in the like 24 25 yep", "start": 993.72, "duration": 20.078}
{"chunk": "and then pitching wedge was again 18 to 22 for you which is fantastic and again if you need to launch it higher like okay we can do that but 95% of the time", "start": 1003.399, "duration": 20.521}
{"chunk": "we need boom we're we're just talking like stock wedges like how to how to hit consistent stock wedges just on a daily basis like there there's going to be", "start": 1013.36, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "times where you got to launch it really high obviously there's be times where you got launch a little throw but yeah those are specialty shots but almost everybody man if they just knew how to", "start": 1022.56, "duration": 15.679}
