{"chunk": "go so there's the chest see it moves the club because the rib started to move it moves the club and what it just just did is you moved the club on top of the", "start": 203.959, "duration": 19.159}
{"chunk": "plane because of this so it's gliding up it's gliding cool I mean I see I see people do this all the time right where they go they go pelvis back yep", "start": 212.599, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "and then they know the the club needs to be on top of the plane so they lift yeah so it gets whacked out so do that at the same time pelvis and arms that just", "start": 222.12, "duration": 17.439999999999998}

{"chunk": "where my mid Line's pointing yep okay so my midline is pointing right here at the camera if I turn over here okay like I was and I drop where's it look like my", "start": 276.56, "duration": 18.72}

{"chunk": "my midline over here yeah and I drop pressure goes to Target there you go so this becomes the pivot so the whole look is I'm Ro I'm I'm here now as I go turn", "start": 296.039, "duration": 20.921}
{"chunk": "turn turn and drop I'm there see how TJ's midline kept moving in this space as he dropped so you're not dropping an", "start": 306.08, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "early unwinding there you go that's the whole load perfect okay I mean took a minute", "start": 315.199, "duration": 15.639}

{"chunk": "some point of course this lead arm is going to start to lift so I'll I'll be the lifter here you're in charge of turning so slowly do this okay so good", "start": 344.08, "duration": 19.200000000000003}

{"chunk": "where do they go oh dude there you go so it's yes so now we need to bounce pivots", "start": 377.8, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "cool all right so let's talk that so we just talked about the whole load phase so if you could te just hug the club or throw the club down one or the other okay and show just the load phase back", "start": 386.639, "duration": 16.761}
{"chunk": "swing and transition okay perfect because TJ's up here like how much pressure do you feel like you have here compared to your", "start": 395.12, "duration": 15.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "Trail foot maybe 8020 okay 8020 the more that you're up here 8020 is the further back you can put your your pivot or push", "start": 402.28, "duration": 16.999}
{"chunk": "your pivot so this this now and we'll do a step drill actually te this is the pivot this is a door knob step this foot out of there", "start": 411.24, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "there you go okay do that one more time", "start": 420.4, "duration": 16.399}

{"chunk": "flexion comes from like I want flexion rotation I want to keep the flexion state in my hips I always early extand it's because of how you move you move", "start": 437.199, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "horrible you big dork sure okay so if we're going back swing pivot based on the upper", "start": 445.879, "duration": 18.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "spiral good now bounce pivots because this is going to curve there you go this is also where trading of the bins", "start": 455.56, "duration": 20.359}
{"chunk": "happens right okay like right now TJ's in a very in a in a very neutral spine show the pelvic action that we talked", "start": 465.919, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "about for backs sping good so right now he's in a slight amount because this was the main engine for for movement slight amount of right Bend got it okay as he", "start": 474.44, "duration": 20.118000000000002}
{"chunk": "starts to Upper spirals do this slowly now he's moving into lead Bend okay and where he's at right now", "start": 484.039, "duration": 15.681999999999999}
{"chunk": "he's where's your pressure up towards Target up towards your target so it's in the lead foot so we've got us the proper amount of lead Bend start slowly", "start": 492.28, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "pivoting properly now you just bounced oh yeah yep now you're in now you're in trail Bend so you went from lead to Trail because of how you pivoted here", "start": 501.72, "duration": 17.478}
{"chunk": "but the only way that we can have this pivot here is being up here far enough so that now I can go that way if I do most people never get up there far", "start": 510.879, "duration": 17.002}
{"chunk": "enough right absolutely okay so there and it's because they early unwind mhm early unwind so it's all yes so so many", "start": 519.24, "duration": 20.32}

{"chunk": "target is not not hit no that's what we we classified as like swing vers hit a swinger vers a hitter okay so swingers look like they're active active with the", "start": 538.44, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "pelvic rotation like even in the transitionary phase and then they'll rotate like kind of tumble the golf club along the plane that's a swinger that's", "start": 548.2, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "a swinger a hitter like if I had a PVC or um a like a sledgehammer and an Axe and a wall right here I I wouldn't just", "start": 556.48, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "open up and then throw it I would first probably step and then from here I'm going to turn but look at where the pivots going to be", "start": 565.12, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "exactly don't you hit me with that I'm kidding I'm going to step so I'm at my midline still over here here's the pivot point and I'm going to go boom yes", "start": 573.32, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "that's the hit that's a hitter versus a swinger okay again it's just our terminology fair enough okay yeah Maps improving Maps", "start": 581.24, "duration": 16.879}

{"chunk": "back swing our back swing good go all the way to transition perfect hit", "start": 597.32, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "it perfect okay so really all that stuff that we just talked about the most the craziest of drills", "start": 605.48, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "would be three steps yeah yeah you can do three steps we're talking about pretty much the entirety of golf swing in this video uhuh I don't know what to title this thing we'll figure it out do", "start": 616.48, "duration": 19.599}
{"chunk": "cool things with your golf swing look neat okay boom upper spiral to control the pivot", "start": 626.079, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "pivot perfect okay now we'll we'll just mess around with this we'll do two different modified two pieces okay set up to", "start": 634.519, "duration": 17.362000000000002}
{"chunk": "it show me back swing to transition is one movement pivot", "start": 643.56, "duration": 18.68}

{"chunk": "you know why cuz it like when people go oh that was really good there's feeling athleticism yes athleticism means that", "start": 665.8, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "we sense things so we feel bounciness we feel when stuff loads we feel when stuff out unloads it just feels nice and that's where Rhythm comes from yeah so", "start": 673.92, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "Rhythm kind of coming from the uhhuh from the lower half here yep okay now let's let's show a 60% but it bounces", "start": 683.36, "duration": 17.279000000000003}
{"chunk": "through all three phases we're never to a position we're through these transitionary phases boom boom", "start": 692.12, "duration": 15.92}

{"chunk": "this stuff for a long time sure but I mean you'll fall into the system so fast now let's just test the system throw as much energy as you can into this while", "start": 709.12, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "while staying within the confines of the system stay a hitter okay and it's still bouncy we're never rigid boom boom", "start": 718.959, "duration": 18.959}
