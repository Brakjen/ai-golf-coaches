{"chunk": "was it a great shot a good shot or good enough shot good enough shot okay and that's a that's kind of a that's kind of an area that a lot of especially like", "start": 347.16, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "our players that we start to introduce they have a hard time kind of answering that question cuz we all know what a great shot is sure flushed perfect ball", "start": 356.88, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "flare my target though that's easy y good shot okay flush maybe not right at my target but still kind of in the realm", "start": 364.72, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "of appropriateness for what I wanted to do sure right and then good enough is where are a lot of our kids get challenged like good enough what's that", "start": 372.56, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "mean yeah like I consider good enough as I hit it somewhere near my target right I caught it somewhere on the club face uhhuh contact was pretty like it was", "start": 380.919, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "still solid in terms of contact y but if we're on the golf course and you hit it and it is playable somewhere near your", "start": 391.08, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "target that's good enough yep right cuz I especially higher level players and we work a lot with Junior golfers yep they", "start": 398.68, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "hit the golf shot and it's either perfect or not perfect that's exactly right super black and white there's no why it's like was it was it perfect right at my target flush perfect ball", "start": 408.28, "duration": 19.638}
{"chunk": "flight or was it not and if it's not yes they go nuts so this is also interesting cuz I'm hitting seven iron here and you're like heavy in decade and", "start": 417.319, "duration": 17.642}
{"chunk": "have been for quite a while now like what what's what's my if I'm a tour player what's my percentage of just hitting the green with seven iron um I", "start": 427.0, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "don't even know G percentage with that I know so if you got seven iron in your hand your dispersion meaning your far your farthest left shot to your farthest", "start": 435.879, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "right shot is about 22 yards okay so so from here to here so good enough if you're on the Range and you can keep whatever Club you have inside that", "start": 443.919, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "dispersion and contact with solid yeah that's good so in essence like 33 ft from the right and 33 ft from the left cuz we got 11 on both sides of middle", "start": 453.24, "duration": 16.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "you got this you got this target right in the middle which you got your dispersion on both sides that's crazy like hitting this and that and that's", "start": 462.12, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "from a a pin like that's not even sand like 33 ft away from the hole because most of the time tour players aren't even looking at the hole they their points reference is away the only time", "start": 469.84, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "coutour players aiming right at the pin is when they got a wedge inside of like 80 yards yeah other than that they're like middle of the green and you know maybe I push it online maybe I pull it", "start": 479.4, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "online but yeah they're just trying to hit that dispersion rate cuz they're I mean they got guys telling them hey your SAR dispersion is terrible you can't aim at the pin yeah right", "start": 488.4, "duration": 19.959999999999997}
{"chunk": "so why I ask you is it great good good enough is because when you have a shot that's one of those three I want you to elicit some", "start": 497.68, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "sort of positive reaction to that interesting so you think positive reaction good emotional reaction so like if I was to ask you what would a", "start": 507.96, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "positive emotional reaction be for you what would you say uh thinking of my kids and my wife okay excellent okay so what I would say is anytime you hit a", "start": 515.599, "duration": 19.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "golf shot where you elicit a great good or good enough shot as you're holding your finish as you're looking at the golf shot in your brain you're thinking", "start": 524.64, "duration": 15.598999999999998}
{"chunk": "of your wife and your kids that's awesome cuz now you're building an emotional reaction to your shot yep right the way the the way the brain works is I it's much more complicated", "start": 533.399, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "than I know but for what I do know yeah when you elicit an emotional response to anything right we're talking golf here so you hit you hit a good golf shot", "start": 542.16, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "positive reaction that gets stored in the subconscious okay now that shot you just hit is stored in your subconscious", "start": 551.519, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "forever it's never going to go away okay same goes for a negative shot though so you hit a you hit a bad shot right you hit a little thin one not quite bad", "start": 558.959, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "reaction you get like you know you give yourself like some some you know negative body language or you say a word or you drop the club those are all", "start": 567.48, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "negative emotional responses okay so here's a question on that too so like from what I know and this could be right or wrong coach that that powerful", "start": 575.519, "duration": 21.12}
{"chunk": "memories come from high emotional stimulus response yes is that yes yes so from a standpoint of being", "start": 585.76, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "able to be confident where confidence would come from from like first te jitters if you're responding more so to what you deem a negative shot would be", "start": 594.68, "duration": 19.479}
{"chunk": "emotionally compared to the good shots you just have memories of poor shots that interesting so if you want to talk", "start": 603.959, "duration": 15.161000000000001}
{"chunk": "like how do you get confidence how do you you know is confidence created as confidence something you've have you can create confidence yeah it just takes a lot of reps you can just do it right", "start": 612.2, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "here you do it right here you do it on the golf course cuz if you think how many how many reactions of people if you go play around of golf how what percentage of those reactions are going", "start": 620.48, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "to be NE versus positive the the the the negatives usually outweigh the positive by like 75 25 most of the time yeah the crazy part", "start": 628.64, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "this is where like deep rooted in the evolution of humans like you know back when humans were first like existed yeah", "start": 637.44, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "caveman survival animals want to kill so fight or flight yeah always negative reactions", "start": 646.0, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "always like they wanted to associate negative reactions to survive so that's more so why we want to respond to the negative it's almost a lot it's a lot", "start": 653.92, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "easier for our brain to pick on up on stuff that's negative and the way the subconscious works is if I respond to something negatively it gets stored in", "start": 662.88, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "my brain right so if I have one negative reaction it takes three positive reactions to offset that wow so if you", "start": 671.72, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "if you react negatively 10 times in a row it's going to require 30 positive ones to get rid of what you just did interesting so that's where all the", "start": 679.639, "duration": 15.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "angst comes from for folks over the top of a golf ball you get you get over a golf searching for this confidence you talk you talk to Golfers who so you know", "start": 687.279, "duration": 21.721}

{"chunk": "hit the golf shot give yourself 3 to 5 Seconds where you've got no reaction you just hold your finish stare at the golf ball", "start": 715.92, "duration": 18.679}

{"chunk": "objective okay and the reason why we want to do something that's objective is it's not emotional right so if we don't elicit emotional response it never gets", "start": 760.32, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "stored in our brain okay so now the bad shot we hit will never get stored as long as we're consciously not reacting in a negative way okay interesting so", "start": 769.44, "duration": 20.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "objectively I think of a big green marshmallow good or something that's really easy that a lot of our kids have had success with is hit a golf shot not", "start": 779.6, "duration": 18.759999999999998}
