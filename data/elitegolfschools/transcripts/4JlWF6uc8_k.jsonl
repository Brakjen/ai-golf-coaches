{"chunk": "ribs and when you're talking about Center mask cuz there's like I can have the center MK of my pointer finger Center MK of my bicep ribs like what", "start": 38.2, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "Center Mass are you talking about we're controling Center Mass the golfing club perfect and those of you that are like what the heck is that I think the", "start": 45.68, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "easiest way to to really figure it out is just hold it like that kind of the balance point of the golf club every club right so Center mass of the club", "start": 54.68, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "and you're saying how you motor it instead of doing it mostly with the hands and arms MH you're talking about the ribs mhm what the heck are you", "start": 62.879, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "saying how do we move it with the ribs well get a little bit of action of kind of that rib sway rotation sure um this", "start": 70.68, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "is the engine anyways so the shapes that I make from here should be able to follow with the club beautiful so your", "start": 79.759, "duration": 15.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "action let me I'll trade you ball for a Club go ahead and just show off that moveie yours man just go ahead and hit one into the screen there for us", "start": 87.24, "duration": 15.48}

{"chunk": "throughout the entirety of your swing yeah so first thing kind of from setup if I kind of break it down I'm thinking", "start": 108.479, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "ribs are going first and as I'm spiraling up uhuh I want this feeling like it gets vertical okay um now obviously it's not going to look that", "start": 116.159, "duration": 19.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "way right for me sure as I now start to transition change direction I just feel ribs are taking everything this way okay", "start": 125.479, "duration": 18.762}
{"chunk": "keeping everything there okay I don't feel it as much dropping with the hands gotcha it's just letting my body be the engine super just react to it yep and", "start": 135.8, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "when you're saying body being the engine we're kind of talking about the ribs in that instance correct yes okay cool so trade you back okay this is kind of a fun little", "start": 145.48, "duration": 21.04}
{"chunk": "exercise and uh we'll throw uh credit where credit should be due this was taught to me by Luke bracky okay so one", "start": 154.8, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "of our favorites we just hold the go a medicine ball just like this elbows are straight out and what we're looking to do is move the axis of the elbows", "start": 164.28, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "meaning if I put a line through my lead elbow and a line through my trail elbow we're looking to move this ball we call call it spiral baring the ball in this", "start": 172.48, "duration": 18.718}
{"chunk": "fashion right here so just show me that beautiful now as Jackson's doing this what's really cool you'll see from a face on perspective lead elbow lowers", "start": 181.519, "duration": 19.841}
{"chunk": "then it'll heighten lower heighten and it's trading lead elbow Trail elbow and this is an under pattern it's very", "start": 191.72, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "similar to our boat drill with the PVC pipe but if you do that from down the line go ahead and show the exact same thing you'll see how this elbow in space", "start": 199.92, "duration": 17.838}
{"chunk": "okay go to neutral for me okay now slow motion start spiraling see the direction that the elbow is moving in space now it goes down back", "start": 208.799, "duration": 20.282000000000004}
{"chunk": "forward now it'll rise and then it comes back out again just keep doing the same exact exercise so see where this is moving in space it's almost like he's", "start": 218.4, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "making this like Circle in space in this way and it's primarily done with what my ribs rib baby yeah so you're not", "start": 226.159, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "cheating and showing like bunch of crazy like arm stuff yeah exactly or like moving the ball around with your hands no all done with the ribs Y which is", "start": 235.64, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "freaking sexy it feels good you're pretty sexy dude okay so let's look let's look at this like in a different perspective as well because what you", "start": 243.56, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "were talking about is how we motor the center of mass of the club like if this is a golf club Center Mass is down here yep go ahead and set up with that ball", "start": 251.439, "duration": 15.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "again okay and let's do it from face on I think it'll be easier to see this PVC pipe is kind of indicative of Jackson's", "start": 258.44, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "midline see it's vertical right now the ax of his of his elbows would look just like this so in essence go ahead and start moving see see the difference in", "start": 266.6, "duration": 19.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "how steep that just got okay now show right here just you spiraling that ball go back to neutral forming okay", "start": 276.16, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "slow motion start spiraling the ball that's now perpendicular to where Jack Jackson's elbows are now go the other way look at where the center Mass just", "start": 285.6, "duration": 19.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "went it fell so this whole idea of shallowing you can shallow it like six ways to Sunday like there's a ton of different ways to do it but if we are", "start": 294.28, "duration": 21.44}

{"chunk": "like I'm just general and to be honest like ja Jackson's like he's one of our best movement coaches really best sacrum", "start": 323.319, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "move in the academy when it comes to to to just general movement and all all the coaches that we have absolutely okay so when he does this like you'll see his", "start": 330.88, "duration": 19.679999999999996}
{"chunk": "his play in the ribs and what it does to affect the center of mass so again you're not doing anything show show cheating just with the hands okay so", "start": 340.44, "duration": 17.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "we're not Gary Sheffield here no okay instead we're going to go Barry Bonds do this in slowmo boom great now go ahead and start", "start": 350.0, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "changing in Direction and just keep it moving but do it in slow motion and you'll see how the center of mass The Hub which is the point right where his", "start": 359.08, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "hands connect all is playing but the the shaft of the golf club is always perpendicular go ahead and go back to", "start": 367.24, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "neutral for me is always perpendicular to this see how the shaft and the axis of his elbows if you start slowmo moving", "start": 376.8, "duration": 20.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "stays perpendicular yep okay keep moving oh look how cool that is it's just all done in the ribs all done in the ribs", "start": 385.68, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "all done in the ribs which is great and that's the main shallower so go ahead and set up for us again gra ball", "start": 395.16, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "here great and if you can Jackson just show us one to the top just a P4 position great see how tall the shaft is", "start": 403.12, "duration": 18.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "there go ahead and set up again let's actually just go to P3 which is kind of our idea of what the end of the back swing would be", "start": 413.0, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "so P3 lead arm is level now as you bounce so right now heavy lead lateral Bend M okay as you bounce from P3 up", "start": 419.96, "duration": 17.24}
{"chunk": "through P4 to P5 go ahead and show that same same shape with the ribs there you go look at the difference and now how how leveled out the center mass of the", "start": 428.84, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "golf club went behind you primarily because now you traded you're in trail lateral Bend instead of lead lateral so stay right there if you just turn to set", "start": 438.12, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "the golf go behind the ball boom there's impact and it's Square that's so cool okay so let's do this go", "start": 446.56, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "ahead and hit us one with this same idea of spiral in the ribs spiral in the golf club spiral in the medicine ball however you want to term it that's the that's", "start": 454.199, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "the picture in your mind okay but kind of a slowmo one and what we'll do is for for folks to see this we'll just slow you down and show how you're moving in", "start": 463.479, "duration": 18.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "that transitional period from like P3 to P5 but nice amount of play in those ribs as you're doing that beautiful let's go ahead and just tap", "start": 472.56, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "one in there you get six iron hit six iron like 140 beautiful so so cool stable stable", "start": 481.72, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "and what's nice like when people go like generally Athletics mhm it's like a stupid term sometimes right right show me an athletic golf swing you're like", "start": 491.4, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "what the heck does that mean yeah you're like I guess Athletics is just like one it's Dynamic and two it's like super", "start": 500.599, "duration": 15.161000000000001}
{"chunk": "sensory like the picture that I have in my mind like right there you have a picture of like what you're doing in here to motor the ball motor the golf club motor your elbows whatever it is", "start": 508.4, "duration": 16.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "it's yours but it's sensory you have a picture in your mind exactly and you can feel it you sense it the feel of it right what are my ribs doing in space to", "start": 516.959, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "motor that around and you just get heightened and it should like especially for good athletes like you you make that golf swing you should immediately go like oh dude that feels so good so good", "start": 525.68, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "feels nice oh yes right feels very nice feels very nice exactly okay so let's show a couple of exercises to and I", "start": 535.36, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "don't even know if you know this one uh Jackson but have we ever talked about the figure8 drill this exercise I'll just show you this so again if we have if we have this", "start": 543.24, "duration": 20.04}
{"chunk": "here this is just generally uh like boat drill for us if you were holding on to the medicine ball we'd be right here so it looks very similar if I had the golf", "start": 552.76, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "club down here and I'm starting to motor the club in essence the center mass of the club is making the shape of a figure", "start": 560.92, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "a okay so we can feel like where the golf club's exiting how it's transitioning how it exit over here how it transition in the other side so we're", "start": 568.36, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "just making this movement and then eventually once you feel it w hit show us one of those from really nice setup", "start": 576.68, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "and then from there hover and in your mind you're just making there you go so you're motoring the center mass of the club the only", "start": 585.32, "duration": 18.078999999999997}
{"chunk": "thing that I'd like to see go right in here and freeze good so the center of mass now is is going to exit and because of the ribs control the center Mass", "start": 594.48, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "Field Loop here yep to go there there's the loop here now it's exit Loop feel where it's at yep up keep it going now", "start": 603.56, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah so you're motoring the center of mass around in space primarily again from the ribs once you feel that feel free to go ahead and just chip one into", "start": 612.079, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "the screen cool so now like was that heavy thin perfect what was that heavy yep so", "start": 620.16, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "let's just move the center M uh of the ribs forward to control where the bottom out is a bit just move the bottom out", "start": 627.92, "duration": 15.040000000000003}
{"chunk": "forward same [Music] exercise beautiful shapes", "start": 635.56, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "beautiful so kind of a fun drill yeah CU again Athletics it's Dynamic it's moving it's playful but also that sensory", "start": 644.44, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "aspect where yeah there's that it's not even just here it's like I can feel we of the club all the way around so now it becomes this like really holistic", "start": 652.76, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "experience M the super holistic experience is like you can feel what the strike is like before you even hit it so it's like yeah I've got result because", "start": 661.839, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "I'm flushing out the ball I feel where the club is I know what my body's doing to support that it's just like that's why I think uh tour players have a", "start": 671.2, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "really difficult time describing what their experienc in their golf swing like if you go hey Justin Rose or Rory or DJ", "start": 680.399, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "like they'll feel different what do you feel in you're swing and they're like they can't like get it out because it's so big it's this huge holistic", "start": 689.16, "duration": 19.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "thing that they're again it's they're sensing it's really difficult to articulate it's it's extremely difficult I mean I struggle so much just", "start": 698.24, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "describing it to the kids what I feel because it's like I feel completely different than and it's exactly like you said and I think that's our job right is to like", "start": 707.519, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "identify that person how how do I put myself in them what are they thinking what are they seeing what are they feeling so that now I can have the", "start": 716.68, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "experience because I'm in you in a way and go okay boom this is what we need to do different rabbit hole but these", "start": 725.48, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "exercises are really really good ones for understanding the ribs role yes and how it Motors the center of masses", "start": 733.959, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "around cuz the ribs what we feel in here can be a play a massive role in in t-spine Bend this lateral Bend", "start": 740.92, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "right there's rotation in that cuz obviously the ribs are like massively involved with rotation and we just talked about it here like pushing the", "start": 749.92, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "divot forward is all because of lateral movement in the center and mass of the ribs oh and that's really what the ribs do is they do those three things lateral", "start": 758.44, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "then we have lateral Bend and rotation if you're able to manage that man it's so much easier to motor the golf oh so easy okay perfect okay last", "start": 767.76, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "thing um to make this like a really fun holistic experience just drill wise let's see three shots and we'll just call them your ones twos and threes so", "start": 777.04, "duration": 19.278000000000002}
{"chunk": "and that's just energy level if I've got this medicine ball here and I'm moving it at a one it's passive y two is more energy in the ribs and three is like big", "start": 787.279, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "waves Big W big wave and that's going to also leak into the golf club okay okay so let's do some figure rates above it", "start": 795.32, "duration": 16.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "what feels like a one and then you can set up to the ball and show what a one feels like from from actual setup okay", "start": 803.88, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "okay boom now we're hover one a super passive feel that energy good now go ahead and set up to the ball go", "start": 811.68, "duration": 22.12}
{"chunk": "one beautiful didn't manage divot okay yeah it was kind of fun again slightly heavy so we can just move the divot forward div forward okay show me a uh", "start": 823.04, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "hover figure eight drill again two beautiful excellent go ahead and set up to it okay let's move the divot forward", "start": 832.279, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "same energy two beautiful that was freaking good see how easy that is too it's like so easy just move the freaking divot forward big", "start": 842.519, "duration": 19.48}
{"chunk": "deal it out now show Big Wave three beautiful okay let's go ahead and set up same figure eight", "start": 850.72, "duration": 15.597}

{"chunk": "rip it back now it's that's a really good point too because now you can feel the same like a motor in the center of mass because of the ribs but now I can really control the ball and wedges might", "start": 880.92, "duration": 19.039}
{"chunk": "feel like they're ones mid irons are kind of twos drivers three mhm but it's the same system just with different energies you can and your ball at that", "start": 890.8, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "super high level and you're moving the instrument as it's designed very efficiently very efficient okay", "start": 899.68, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "ribs move the center of mass based on how you're moving the ribs super fun Jackson wary ladies and gentlemen flush them out it's been a", "start": 907.56, "duration": 17.12}
