{"chunk": "that first one would love to answer yeah so yesterday how can an old guy generate more", "start": 92.72, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "cluball that's great so the the the question was how can an older gentleman create more Club head speed so this a", "start": 100.759, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "great question we get this question pretty often like speed is one of those things that everybody's looking for more", "start": 109.52, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "and before let's just find two different like lenses here there's a difference between speed and distance you can have", "start": 117.479, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "a 100 mph Club speed and only hit the golf ball 200 yards that would be a thing so we want efficiency first so the number one thing that we want to take a", "start": 127.719, "duration": 17.522000000000002}
{"chunk": "look at especially with driver if you can in your home setup or if you can't do this at your home setup just go to PJ tour super store you can take your", "start": 136.56, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "driver in there and just get proper numbers like how's the golf ball launching how's it spinning and what's the smash Factor just in general off the", "start": 144.68, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "face like with driver perfect smash factor is 1.5 and what where that number actually comes from is how fast the ball is coming off", "start": 153.36, "duration": 20.44}
{"chunk": "compared to how fast the club head speed is so in the example of 100 mph Club speed if I'm smashing it at 1.5 the ball", "start": 163.8, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "would come off at 150 mil an hour so that's where smash Factor comes from but then we need launch and we need proper spin", "start": 172.84, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "and there's an optimal for this but somewhere roughly this will just be for all Club speeds like from 80 mil an hour", "start": 180.72, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "all the way to 115 ideally we're launching the golf ball somewhere around 13 14 15\u00b0 is and then we have a a a spin of", "start": 188.28, "duration": 21.36}
{"chunk": "about 2, maybe 2500 somewhere in there and what that means is like the golf ball is going to launch then it's going to hit and then it's going to run out", "start": 198.04, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "it'll give you the optimum carry and run out so you get like Optimum distance there that's the distance formula not necessarily the speed", "start": 207.239, "duration": 19.602}
{"chunk": "formula so speed guys like number one correlator with speed is the player's ability to jump so older folks you don't", "start": 216.4, "duration": 19.559}
{"chunk": "need to jump as much but we need the opportunity for working vertically now if you're going to work vertically that means that in this transitionary period", "start": 227.239, "duration": 15.798999999999998}
{"chunk": "as the golf club is finishing working up in space you'd be dropping to some so my booty moves here now you'll notice", "start": 235.079, "duration": 17.442}
{"chunk": "when I drop kind of drops in this space the reason for this is if I'm dropping in this space one it's a very healthy", "start": 243.12, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "move but two the only way to jump is to lower in the first place so now from here if I turn and just rotate up that's", "start": 251.04, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "the vertical move that we see out of all these folks that hit the golf ball a little bit further and gain Club speed now for older folks too you have limited", "start": 259.88, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "Mobility for the most part so once you drop in so right in here as I drop now as I turn I'm going to turn but see how the left", "start": 269.28, "duration": 18.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "foot can work out of the space so the whole thing this would be obviously I have seven iron here but you can do this a driver you're here drop gone that", "start": 278.199, "duration": 18.0}

{"chunk": "your preference who looks like a hit any any ADV um that's a great question because like here's what I'd encourage", "start": 514.479, "duration": 18.401}

{"chunk": "lot of the stuff that I prefer man I love that stuff like right in here where the player dropping turn and the club goes behind we're right in here to be", "start": 557.64, "duration": 16.560000000000002}

{"chunk": "intention is and he has a lot of that in his actual swing but here's the deal I think a lot", "start": 583.2, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "of people see our stuff and they're like oo a rotational swing well yeah there's rotation in the golf swing there's also", "start": 592.44, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "vertical Force there's also lateral Force you have angular Force you have all these different forces and what I'm looking to do always is organize those forces for each individual player so", "start": 600.2, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "they experience better Golf and they hit better shots at the end of the day the arms do lower to some degree they do go", "start": 609.64, "duration": 15.799}

{"chunk": "and you're going to enjoy practice you'll feel nice you move nice tissue elongates blah blah blah so what I would", "start": 702.36, "duration": 16.639}

{"chunk": "same spot but I got it there in two totally different ways and what you've got to start to understand guys is like if you actively thr thow a movement it", "start": 771.199, "duration": 19.841}
{"chunk": "it's it's going to leak because it's Dynamic into additional movements after that so the first action is me taking", "start": 781.32, "duration": 15.758}
{"chunk": "this lead arm and moving it right across my Bo my body this is adduction of the lead arm if I do that hard enough it's eventually especially if I hold on to", "start": 788.839, "duration": 17.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "something that has mass to it like a golf club if I go hard enough notice what the shape of the golf club looks like here look at the shape of my arm", "start": 798.24, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "because of this adduction of the lead arm it moved M into an internal state after I threw it across my body so there goes the golf club behind me so I rolled", "start": 806.36, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "it inside it's because that is a distal to proximal Act and the golf swing is a proximal to distal act so instead what", "start": 815.36, "duration": 18.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "if you just moved your rib cage in way that looked like this and what if you tried to keep this hand right out in front of you so notice how the ribs are", "start": 824.56, "duration": 18.639}

{"chunk": "in front of me while I did this see how the right arm is still absolutely on top of the left compared to me racing this across now the left arm has climbed and", "start": 843.279, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "it's worked on top of the right we'll look at the two different looks here or here now it's tall see how the golf", "start": 852.759, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "club's right up on top of the plane it's because the ribs have moved first and the arms get towed along so you just set up to shots going proximal and then the", "start": 861.36, "duration": 18.12}

{"chunk": "how it's just the ribs that are being pulled like this spiral tissue is elongating and if I kept turning it would now start to turn the pelvis and", "start": 1380.52, "duration": 15.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "the pelvis would rotate into this space so why this creates depth is two reasons one the spiral tissue pulls in this", "start": 1387.919, "duration": 16.681}

{"chunk": "who does that that's really freaking cool to be able to get to that level so we just built this out which I think we're like crazy pumped to do but look", "start": 1667.039, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
