{"chunk": "let's hit one more just focused on focused on press pressure the feet yep okay lateral curve back up into lead curves", "start": 0.12, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "away that was even better that was even [Music]", "start": 10.2, "duration": 23.75}
{"chunk": "better let's start this again oh now brown cow hi TJ hey bro how you doing I'm", "start": 22.4, "duration": 20.8}
{"chunk": "awesome man how are you good good dude we're uh uh back outside maybe one of the last times that we'll be outside uh here in in Colorado I want to hear that", "start": 33.0, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "I know got a pretty fun video here absolutely a lot of questions on this one mhm what are we talking about today there te uh creating space in the golf", "start": 41.96, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "swing um I think a lot of people struggle with just feeling real bunched up down at impact like they don't have any room to move whether that's their", "start": 50.76, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "arms their chest Etc yeah yeah and I think that's um it's it's funny because golfers um you know we're fortunate", "start": 58.16, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "enough to work with a a lot of players and a lot of golf nerds as well and one of the things that um is always interesting is the saying", "start": 67.72, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "that you know after we start moving and they kind of get into a system that we really like they go man it feels like I have so much room or so much space at", "start": 76.759, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "the bottom hear that a lot okay and that's kind of important too it's not like we're talking about space up here at the top we're talking about like the hit area and feeling like we just have", "start": 85.119, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "room to do stuff down there like the arms have like passage they can move they can swing like I don't feel like I'm like bottled up and like I don't", "start": 94.36, "duration": 19.16}
{"chunk": "have room to operate down there which is like a highly unathletic feel no yeah like feeling all bunched up down here it's like what are we what are we doing", "start": 103.84, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "yeah yeah yeah exactly and just it's this again this idea of of space is like massively important so again where does", "start": 112.32, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "it come from how do we create these spatial pieces right so um let's just start with just a general concept te if you go ahead and set up for us you got", "start": 120.24, "duration": 19.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "it the number one spatial piece that we're going to look at here number one is the the radius that you have just", "start": 129.52, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "created and set up from your sternum to the club head like the middle of the club so the radius is just the middle portion of that Circle it's just this", "start": 138.0, "duration": 15.998999999999999}
{"chunk": "space like how far away you are so you can just kind of visualize a straight line coming right out of your sternum yep pointing right of the club head exactly exactly so if you just make a", "start": 146.519, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "back swing for us let's go ahead and just do that okay did your sternum get further away or closer to the ball in that move", "start": 155.12, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "a little further away a lot further away like probably another foot so it's moved clearly this way right yes exactly okay", "start": 163.879, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "well where did that come from interesting okay so we talk a lot about like this thoracic region and what it does again this is review for those of", "start": 172.76, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "you that watch our Channel a lot which thank you um but the main purpose of the chest and its", "start": 181.4, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "movement is um it we move it laterally we'll rotate it and there is in our in our C and and T spine primarily we've", "start": 189.44, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "got this thoracic Bend this lateral Bend okay okay so again this is kind of piggybacking off of like one of the videos that we did very recently which", "start": 199.28, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "is this idea of lateral move first so if I have this space right here away from the golf ball if I move laterally just this move", "start": 207.2, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "am I getting closer or further away from the ball you're getting a little further away from it there we go if I just turned okay and we'll talk about proper", "start": 216.72, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "turn here just in a second and I'll do this properly if I turn did I get further or closer to the ball further away from it okay so a lot of people", "start": 224.799, "duration": 18.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "like if you stack up this lead side and and the the visual here is like these lead side joints like main joint joint groups knee complex hip complex shoulder", "start": 233.48, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "complex there's two ways to turn and and really when we're saying Turn I'm just moving this midline and rotating it away from the target okay got it so I could", "start": 242.84, "duration": 16.958999999999996}
{"chunk": "have a pivot where the pivot is is more so in this like right side and so if I were to turn I would look like this okay", "start": 251.439, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "okay this would be improper because these lead side joints just crashed into this space so they all go towards the", "start": 260.239, "duration": 15.641}
{"chunk": "golf ball in that respect if the it's in the right yes got it exactly so what we'll see is this idea that the the the", "start": 267.72, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "player will exactly immediately move ESP you'll see it definitely in the knee and definitely in the shoulder this just responds okay but it crashes into this", "start": 275.72, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "space here closer to the golf ball got it and now like one there is no lateral move if you're moving that way yeah I'm I'm All stacked up on this side too", "start": 284.84, "duration": 21.36}
{"chunk": "exactly so your sternum may have gone a bit away a little bit away from the golf ball but it's not far enough because", "start": 294.24, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "these lead joints are actually closer to the ball got it so to create space late what would you have to do well I'm going to have", "start": 303.28, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "to yeah jump up out of the way right yep which causes this extension move here where you just went with this Trail hip if you go in extension here which means", "start": 311.16, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "this hip is coming into this space here where does your sternum go uh towards the ball or away from it away from the ball right they just work in opposition", "start": 320.16, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "so if I move my pelvis forward so this is just hip extension this has to go back to keep me just in general balance okay so I'm I'm creating some space with", "start": 329.68, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "the sternum but I'm doing it with with this move yes and maybe there's some problems with that there's a lot of problems with that right because the the", "start": 339.0, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "issue with this space feel is like if I go into extension here I I don't I no longer have room for my arms to swing", "start": 347.479, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "underneath my trunk as soon as I go here this this is where the arms want to swing and I'm in the way so guess what they're out and around I don't have any room in here M you'll see these guys", "start": 356.919, "duration": 19.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "like that way where the room between like the handle and their pelvis is really has really shrunk so the player", "start": 366.52, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "experiences this feeling where the arms don't have room I don't have any space for them to swing across or underneath my trunk or the", "start": 374.479, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "thoracic so there's a sequence to this in that we need the sternum in like the early portion of the back swing to", "start": 383.56, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "really be creating this space because the pivot is more in the right hip sock or excuse me the um the lead side joints", "start": 392.759, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "okay so the right side those joints would move this way there you go now just as the athlete like if we both have", "start": 399.88, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "a golf ball right here sure okay getting ready to hit if I go this way okay where did your sternum go relative to the golf ball in that move", "start": 410.08, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "closer good compared to this way further away like how much more room do you have now tons yes yep and what we'll see like", "start": 418.72, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "almost in every single like really high level player that we love their their pattern like Rory you'll see his lead leg actually go into a bit of extension", "start": 427.84, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "to start like a bit it's not a ton he's and he's not just pushing this it's because he's moved laterally so the knee almost hides behind the trail", "start": 436.8, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "knee uhhuh there it is is yeah so just this early lateral boom see that like this knee just hides got it then from", "start": 446.84, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "here as he turns and is reentering his turn makes his sternum move away and now as he drops and move into moves into the lead side way more flexion so he's moved", "start": 455.319, "duration": 21.12}
{"chunk": "this back into this space but it's no closer than where it started at a dress meaning when I'm saying it's I'm saying", "start": 466.159, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "the sternum isn't any closer okay he like not like in transition Rory's crashing all the way in here M right he just if this is our start point we move", "start": 474.52, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "away yep and then back to the start point exactly there you go because now from there like what what we're searching for is this idea that as I", "start": 484.28, "duration": 18.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "rotate my t-spine okay or my thoracic through the strike that my arms can get shot out and the curve like this whole", "start": 493.159, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "like low left yep phase like this thought and like we see this like the club is low left yeah the the reason it's low left is because of the", "start": 502.24, "duration": 18.118000000000002}
{"chunk": "curvature in the thoracic this High exit okay kind of a different topic but it's important for the whole piece here is if I crash and I'm creating space this", "start": 510.919, "duration": 19.442}
{"chunk": "locks down I'm no longer rotating this so as I fire the arms where do they exit way high exactly compared to off of it", "start": 521.32, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "drop back in now as I turn all I'm doing is letting the energy go out but I'm not trying to make it go left it goes left", "start": 530.519, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "that free rotation of the thoracic that creates the low left exit yes to really achieve that you've got to have space to", "start": 538.92, "duration": 15.159999999999998}
{"chunk": "do so you've got to be in here where now I can freely rotate exactly shoot the arms out so a lot of it is just a sequence of stuff like if I rotate early", "start": 546.44, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "chances are I'm going to crash the lead joints into the golf ball space and the sternum isn't far enough away to be able to drop back in yes but if I go lateral", "start": 555.56, "duration": 20.12}
{"chunk": "early uhhuh and then turn with the pivot being in here yeah see how this lead stayed away from this space like let's let's do two different movements here go", "start": 565.16, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "ahead and show proper movement good see this knee pretty much the entire time stayed away now in transition watch where it goes it'll", "start": 574.0, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "come back into this space there you go but your sternum isn't any closer than where it started compared to go ahead and start again okay go ahead and pivot", "start": 582.12, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "poorly meaning the pivots in your Trail side so all this would work into the space see this knee immediately crashed mhm and so now big pelvic rotation to", "start": 590.04, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "get that out of there and then see how that moved the sternum away so now you created space from the sternum but you don't have space for the arms to swing", "start": 599.8, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "freely and you want both right we need them both working like when people say oh man I have space what they're really saying is the arms have room they have", "start": 608.8, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "free passage under the trunk got it rather than if I do this I have I no longer have that yep okay so there's kind of a lot there so how do we take", "start": 617.32, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "this and like just generally digest it sure okay so to have space when I say that we're saying that the arms have", "start": 625.88, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "free passage to have space in the hit we need to move in proper sequence in the load phase okay load phase is from P1 to", "start": 633.72, "duration": 19.919}
{"chunk": "P5 and generally P5 is just this delivery position and what we want from there is the idea now that the pivot can", "start": 644.12, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "be in the trail uh hip complex and Trail shoulder and Trail knee complex so I'd be going", "start": 652.6, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "lateral chest rotation or thoracic rotation once I feel that go now I'm just going to drop and that dropping gets me landed back up in this see all", "start": 661.2, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "this knee flexion mhm that's where the load the finish of the load that's perfect so from right there trail trail", "start": 669.6, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "trail this is all the pivot and let's go ahead and do this with a step so if we're here M if we stepped we'd look like this there you go and that creates", "start": 678.32, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "space again lot the space yep there you go and there goes the sternum away and so what do the arms hands and Club get to", "start": 687.44, "duration": 19.238}
{"chunk": "do shoot shoot out yeah just goes yeah it's like it's like hard to even get into the ground that way like you got so much space there you got room yep yep", "start": 696.519, "duration": 16.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "totally exactly and for driver we'll actually see what you just did in certain players totally Patrick Reed uh Lead Foot D weights well you'll definitely see the long drive patterns", "start": 705.72, "duration": 18.560999999999996}
{"chunk": "too right this V weting going that way so what's really important here if we're going to going to do that I can't just drop improperly and be back like most of", "start": 714.44, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "the pressure is in my trail foot if I'm going to have the pivot back in this like Trail hip complex I had better be", "start": 723.44, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "up here like I've got 70 80% of my pressure up here right now because now as this becomes the pivot who boom now", "start": 731.839, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "I'm good you can move away yeah and with long drive pattern that's the lateral move mhm but what's kind of coola here", "start": 741.76, "duration": 15.719}
{"chunk": "is we're combining two of these forces together in our minds because the rotation rotational Force this angular Force to shoot out there's my space so I", "start": 749.68, "duration": 19.681}
{"chunk": "can do that also creates the lateral Force the opposing Force so I've got this pressure up in the lead foot if", "start": 759.16, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "this is the pivot rotate rotate rotate see where my pressure starts to go yep now I'm more like 50/50 in here totally so as the lateral starts to work away", "start": 767.36, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "and we'll see this in drivers for sure like long drive pattern I'm away away away guess what the club gets to do shoot out it shoots an opposition I'm", "start": 775.48, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "going that way because of curvature not because I'm just doing this like Rocky stuff through the strike up here turning see how I'm going away from the Target", "start": 783.8, "duration": 17.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "and allows this to shoot out because you've got such good thoracic rotation that moves you away yep so it's not it's not like you're just tilting back yes", "start": 793.399, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "right it's so all this talk the reason this is like such a deep conversation yep is", "start": 803.079, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "because this idea or this feeling this athletic feeling of space for the arms to swing freely is in 3D space and", "start": 809.839, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "that's difficult to visualize sometimes human beings suck at 3D space totally we can see 2D so lines yeah yep like this", "start": 819.56, "duration": 20.401}
{"chunk": "oh he's dropping I see that well I'm on this plane 2D right as soon as I drop and turn it's like okay well where did the pelvis really good like this math", "start": 829.56, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "equation starts in our mind M it's like rubbing the top of your head and your stomach in opposite directions at the same time two simple feels it's hard to picture and hard to like execute on", "start": 838.44, "duration": 21.159}
{"chunk": "absolutely yeah okay so working on this like what we need from a dynamic perspective is the ability in the", "start": 848.279, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "transitional phase so we'll call that from P3 to P5 okay that the player is working back into this", "start": 856.72, "duration": 15.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "space so that they can get out of that space through the strike and they're getting out of that space right there because of rotation and the pivot point", "start": 864.36, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "there you go and the golf club could just go wo out yeah got it yep so try practicing this very good thing for", "start": 874.72, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "players to do just to experience this is big lad you can do it with wedge just try it with seven iron at first and then you can just kind of tame it down so it", "start": 883.44, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "feels right but big lateral move big away big drop in for load so we're huge", "start": 892.48, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "here boom I'm way up here it feels like I've almost like dynamically invaded this space so that now this can be the pivot and I can shoot all this out", "start": 901.16, "duration": 18.44}
{"chunk": "that's what we want so that's the feel right yes so if we're just looking at unload phase it's the pivot that's back here and you've got all this pressure", "start": 911.16, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "that's gone into like this space up in here like we're up there there you go so that now this can stay back there and all those there you go and you can see", "start": 918.639, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "how the golf club would just shoot out yeah okay so let's see one that's", "start": 926.839, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "cruisy okay but we got big lateral big away kind of into P3 got it right so just show us kind of P3 and it's just", "start": 934.759, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "going to be lateral away good now ideally we're right here so I'll help you okay so as I'm motoring", "start": 943.72, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "this up into P5 like through P4 to P5 you just drop back into that space good excellent now from there turn and shoot", "start": 952.839, "duration": 20.48}
{"chunk": "it there you go okay let's see one kind of cruised out lateral away drop back", "start": 963.319, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "in and then shoot beautiful beautiful now when TJ does that that's really interesting did you hit that well no is that hosle yeah", "start": 971.68, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "it was hle it's awesome pretty good okay so th this is where you get to diagnose correctly this is actually kind of fun uhhuh so you hit it on the hosle did you", "start": 981.36, "duration": 17.559}
{"chunk": "feel like you shot energy out I did you did do that so we need more space which means that this is the pivot we need to shoot the pivot back into the trail hit more so we can curve away more let's do", "start": 990.279, "duration": 18.482}
{"chunk": "the same exercise more space on this side right yep exactly you can even feel as if like because of the space that you're creating you're going to hit it", "start": 999.56, "duration": 15.359000000000002}
{"chunk": "on the toe on this one let's do the same exercise let's drop back in good beautiful much better there you go", "start": 1007.0, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "so again you're messing with the system and in order to be able to feel good through the strike totally see one in in", "start": 1015.519, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "one motion now sure lateral pivot to move it away drop back in pivot to turn it away", "start": 1023.48, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "oh and what's awesome like I can see it and you can feel it how easy it was for the golf club to just go it just shoots", "start": 1034.48, "duration": 15.038}
{"chunk": "through energy or through the through the impact and again if we talking like feelings that we're searching for with students that's one that I'm hunting for", "start": 1042.959, "duration": 16.042}
{"chunk": "is like the golf club feels free just totally free like it gets so far out away from you fully released all that goodness yep but we get all the like", "start": 1050.0, "duration": 18.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "really good stuff because thoracic rotation is the main face stabilizer so it doesn't feel like it's spinning out of there it feels like it easily", "start": 1060.039, "duration": 15.399999999999999}
{"chunk": "releases blah blah blah mhm okay final topic on this okay and this can help just like kind of sense if I'm moving", "start": 1067.76, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "well or not just where the pressure is going okay so let's go ahead and just set up together here and we're going to set up", "start": 1075.6, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "so that we're like feels like we're either like on the balls are slightly into the toes to start with so we're definitely not heel loaded we're more", "start": 1083.48, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "like balls of the feet toe bias got it okay when we go lateral we're going to stay out in that ball of the foot we're not like if I rotate right here I'm", "start": 1090.72, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "going to go I'm going to go into the heel straight to the heel yep so I stay out here now as I curve I'm going to go", "start": 1099.28, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "into the the the arch of the Trail foot and probably 70ish per that's right here in the arch of the foot okay SE meaning", "start": 1106.2, "duration": 16.599}
{"chunk": "70% of my weight here 30% of my weight here okay okay now as I turn and I'm and I'm dropping now I'm going to work back", "start": 1114.919, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "heavily like 80% up here into the ball of this foot okay so it traced from away into the arch and then goes back up this", "start": 1123.919, "duration": 17.322000000000003}
{"chunk": "way yeah maybe we could show that from here too yep so it goes away then curves a bit into the arch and then back into", "start": 1133.32, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "the meat of this foot got it now from there that's just the load phase that shape okay there you go beautiful now", "start": 1141.48, "duration": 15.000000000000002}
{"chunk": "from there as you curve you're going to go into the heel and then away and it curves away that way there you go and if you just kept spiraling you go all the", "start": 1149.12, "duration": 16.439}
