{"chunk": "it, my path is definitely going to be left and my face is also going to be be left. So, the reason for bringing this", "start": 567.519, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "up is your your ball position with driver compared to to eight iron is going to be different, especially when", "start": 574.48, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
