{"chunk": "use these shots on the golf course so talking about trajectories high shots low shots I think this uh piggybacks well off the previous video", "start": 9.0, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "of draws and Fades yes it's important to know how to hit them but again doesn't mean you just got to go out there and free ball at hitting every shot shape", "start": 24.48, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "every trajectory just because correct I think everybody like we're really good examples of this of like our stock shots yes go a certain height yes right like", "start": 33.28, "duration": 17.319}
{"chunk": "I've I've very much been a lower ball hitter over my career you've very much been a higher ball hitter over your career and you've we've both embraced those kind of roles that our ball", "start": 42.079, "duration": 17.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "flights kind of have yes and we just kind of stick to them yes obviously you play enough golf you're going to find yourself in situations where it's like okay I have to launch this higher yes cu", "start": 50.96, "duration": 17.558000000000003}
{"chunk": "a tree in front of me or something in the in the way or I have to keep this under the wind or keep it under some tree branches and I'm sure we've all been in those situations before and", "start": 60.079, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "maybe we've tried to hit that shot and we haven't really had the correct either setup or just kind of the correct map of how to do that right so I'll hit the", "start": 68.08, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "high shot and how I go about it is just like the previous video with shot shapes it's going to start with setup I'm going to have a stock set up now from here", "start": 76.96, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "personally I make the stance a little wider and we're talking half a step in both directions from here the only other", "start": 86.96, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "thing I'm going to do different is when I try to come back into impact I'm trying to have the shaft pretty vertical not a whole lot of shaff as that starts", "start": 95.2, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "to De off the club okay that makes sense so you're trying to get the like you said when you're getting back to the golf ball at your impact Point yes you're trying to let more or less you're", "start": 104.92, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "trying to let that club head get a little more released as you're getting to impact not so much after impact yes so yeah I'm wanting it to be the way", "start": 114.28, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "I've described as the clubs at its truest Loft rather than when there shaff Ling it's delofting what the the original LI or Li angle Loft angle is of", "start": 122.88, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "gotcha so that angle that we have that angle of attack at impact is going to be just a little bit higher than we would see for a stock shot right okay so stock", "start": 132.64, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "setup then half a step in both directions then again I'm going to start to have a more arm swinging motion so the arc is more in front of me and", "start": 140.44, "duration": 18.999999999999996}
{"chunk": "you're going to see that my exit exit's going to be much more between my shoulder and my head versus down here in the rib cage armpit area so we're paying", "start": 149.56, "duration": 15.639}
{"chunk": "attention to two things we're paying attention to where the club works up at the start and where it releases and finishes during the follow through correct and what club seven seven yeah", "start": 158.319, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "that's definitely a higher trajectory for seven iron well and the other thing to notice too is I made a very small divot just about picked it so that tells", "start": 170.68, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "you the club's coming in very shallow this way so I'm picking it rather than really compressed anded hit one with a", "start": 177.36, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "little more compression a little more of an angle of attack here just for kind of everyone for everyone to see at home like what that divot looks like yes so this will be more of a stock swing yeah", "start": 185.319, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "so just let's just make a stock swing to be able to compare the differences there yeah definitely more compressed launch is a little bit lower but yeah", "start": 194.799, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "that big thing you can pay attention to is what that divot is doing there I think that's a key indicator of just simply what angle that com", "start": 203.4, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "down I think too if you can Pi if maybe he'll get picked up or not but just the sound between the two there was more of that like kind of picked clean and then", "start": 210.68, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "there's more of a a thump correct you can tell by the ears like there's obviously a difference in the sound obviously makes sense since we're trying to hit a little bit different shot yes", "start": 218.4, "duration": 17.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "so if I'm you know learning how to hit the golf ball high when would I need to know or when would I need to know when to use it when I'm on the golf course", "start": 227.36, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "yeah I'd say um the simplest one is anytime you have to go over something that would be the easiest way to me that's that's basic as far as okay", "start": 236.68, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "there's a tree I have to go over so I need a little bit more of that throwing motion the other one I think that starts to go towards more of an advanced player", "start": 245.439, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "is a front pin yes right you don't have that whole lot of you know the pin's three to five Paces on you don't have a whole lot of room correct so you want a higher ball flight that's going to land", "start": 253.72, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "softer and stop quicker you know like the the swing I put trying to hit it high was probably like me trying to max out the height then you start to play", "start": 263.0, "duration": 15.079}
{"chunk": "okay well how how high correct how much closer is it to the stock swing and you play with that right that was me trying to go okay if I really had to hoist this one up here's like the nth degree in", "start": 269.759, "duration": 18.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "which You' see me do it yeah there's definitely parameters to how much do I release the hands how much do I continue to let the club Head released obviously you get to play around with that at the", "start": 279.84, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "ring yeah and I'd say probably the last thing to touch on is speed is your friend more speed more spin correct so play with how much speed and when you", "start": 287.6, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "want to apply it yeah so I mean to to make it simple the faster I swing the easier it is for me to let that club Head release quicker which obviously", "start": 295.28, "duration": 16.279}
{"chunk": "produces a little more higher ball flight and we're back and we're back yeah so now we talked high and we've seen like kind of a stock trajectory yes", "start": 303.759, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "now if we want to keep it low or lower lower but I think lower is the key word we we're not trying to hit it you know 10et off the ground it's cool to be able", "start": 311.039, "duration": 15.801}
{"chunk": "to hit that shot but just for a a normal golfer anyone watching at home that wants to just learn ball flights and trajectories this would be I would say for me my ball flight that goes a little", "start": 319.12, "duration": 18.158}
{"chunk": "bit lower is going to be you know five to 10 yards maybe lower maybe even less than that it's probably going to be less than that but the key thing that like", "start": 328.319, "duration": 16.482}
{"chunk": "like trino talked about is I'm changing half of it's in the setup half of it's in how I think about swinging the golf club yes now what I want people at that", "start": 336.16, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "watching to understand is like I'm not trying to change my swing I'm trying to swing the same way yes there are certain characteristics in which will'll change", "start": 345.12, "duration": 15.639999999999999}
{"chunk": "so for me to be completely honest with you ball position doesn't really dictate a difference for me I don't try to change my ball position unless again I'm", "start": 352.72, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "trying to Stinger it under the under the wind it's got to be really but for a stock shot if I'm trying to hit this you know close to the same distance I'm", "start": 361.08, "duration": 15.318999999999999}
{"chunk": "going to set up to the golf ball with a stock stance stock setup and what I'm really controlling here what I'm trying to focus on is one the most important", "start": 369.199, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "thing for me is lowering the the speed of the Swing yeah a lot of people confuse okay if I'm trying to hit a golf ball lower they'll put that golf ball way back in their stance and they'll", "start": 377.919, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "really try and hit down on it with a lot of speed well when you do that your angle of attack gets steeper and the more speed that you swing with the more spin you generate and that spins what", "start": 387.039, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "gets the golf ball to go in the air so the easiest way to lower spin is to swing softer yes and so that's what I'll do that's my main focus is okay if I", "start": 396.08, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "know what my normal swings feels like at 85% all right what does it feel like it's 70% what does that do to the ball flight and then the second thing is as", "start": 403.68, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "I'm going through the Impact Zone I'm really trying to feel like my hand stay in front of the club yeah a lot of shling right so like what we were talking about earlier the opposite of", "start": 412.16, "duration": 15.358}
{"chunk": "hitting the golf ball high I need my hands to stay in front of the club head as long as I possibly can yes that angle of attack stays a little bit lower yes", "start": 419.919, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "and then my abbreviated finish is going to look like Tommy Fleetwood so you know we're trying to hit this golf ball low here and low is relative for everybody", "start": 428.28, "duration": 16.361}
{"chunk": "but yes I'm trying to hit this golf ball under the wind or just kind of at on a window that I want to be repeatable uhuh so stock swing stock set up for me and", "start": 436.16, "duration": 19.958999999999996}
{"chunk": "all I'm trying to do is control again the speed at which I swing it and really abbreviating and holding my finish what club do you have there and", "start": 446.199, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "that's eight yeah see that's pretty low for an eight again relative right right and I think I think for me it's like that sound it makes when it comes off the club face but for for me one of the", "start": 455.0, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "checkpoints that I pay attention to is again where yes I can pay attention I know that hands lower instead of you know you", "start": 463.879, "duration": 18.44}
{"chunk": "look like you had the hands up here a little bit more and there's obviously a a a conscious effort to make that happen so I'm really just paying attention to again that that speed of my swing", "start": 473.56, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "through the Impact Zone and making sure that my hands are all kind of staying in front of that club face yeah and I I think with that you know couple shots", "start": 481.919, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "that come to mind or you know when I would hit this would be into the wind trying to flight it more for distance control what's maybe another one that", "start": 490.479, "duration": 15.399999999999999}
{"chunk": "comes to mind when you would hit it lower I mean distance control for sure I think something that a lot of people will get in the habit of that's", "start": 498.159, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "obviously a bad habit is it's into the wind and they've got the the the club that goes the distance that they're they're shooting their their shot at and", "start": 505.4, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "they try and just hit one either up into the wind or like we were talking about earlier back of the stance and trying to hit down on it so definitely controlling distances right controlling that speed", "start": 512.88, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "of the swing under the wind so that it doesn't spin too much also like I think the easiest way to look at it is just if I was looking at this from face on like", "start": 521.88, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "the faster I swing here like I didn't consciously do anything to my release my club but my club wants to get in front of my hands", "start": 530.64, "duration": 18.520999999999997}
{"chunk": "the faster I swing if I'm trying to control the speed at my swing I know it's a lot easier for my hands to stay in front of that clubit yeah and I think", "start": 539.76, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "one one thing to know on that you know a lower shot is going to require the player to be in a little bit more flexion butts back chest is down to keep", "start": 547.68, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "that shling yes versus a higher shot you're going to see a little bit more extension and it's not so much right the thrusting extension it's more extension", "start": 556.2, "duration": 17.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "up because that lets the club lever come out you get more of that neutral shaft dangle kicks the club correct it's not it's not inappropriate extension at all", "start": 564.76, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "it's understanding that for certain shots to hit requires more flexion or if you're trying to hit a higher golf shot it requires a little bit more extension yes playing around with that is", "start": 573.76, "duration": 17.879}
{"chunk": "definitely an easy way to figure out okay what does it feel like to first get into that extension feel two what does that do to the ball flight yes right so I think especially like we talked about", "start": 582.48, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "in the last video of shot shaping left and right right to left the same thing goes with the trajectories you go play around with it like you're going to find", "start": 591.48, "duration": 16.361}
{"chunk": "a trajectory that you hit that it's pretty easy to produce yes on a repeatable scale figure what that is and then just kind of roll with it and then", "start": 599.48, "duration": 15.558}
{"chunk": "just you know practice this on the Range or practice this on the golf course and at at some point you're going to have certain windows that you hit certain clubs out of that are easier to produce", "start": 607.399, "duration": 18.802}
