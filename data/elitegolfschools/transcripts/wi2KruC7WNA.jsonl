{"chunk": "it actually usually helps you get the club back to the golf ball albe it it's not the most appropriate way or healthy way but your brain and your body go okay", "start": 367.28, "duration": 17.159}

{"chunk": "so just imagine if I was giving you a lesson I said okay we're going to stop early extending stop humping it but you're still pulling down well now I've moved your low point back because", "start": 383.72, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "there's no mechanism to save you correct now you're like you're blending like inappropriate swing Now with an appropriate swing and you're kind of like blending the two together so it's", "start": 392.28, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "like yeah it makes sense why you're hitting three feet behind the golf ball because you're actually actively rotating more appropriately but now you're still you're still pulling on", "start": 401.16, "duration": 16.881}

{"chunk": "rate the chest rotating at a certain rate what are some kind of drills or some some feels that people can do to help them with this yeah so the first", "start": 451.319, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "one we threw the G shallower on you and what I like about this is there's a line on it we'll talk about that in a second that people can look at for reference so", "start": 458.96, "duration": 17.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "what you're going to do with this guy is make a back swing and that pad is going to be pretty much right up against your right peck so from here if you guys are", "start": 468.52, "duration": 18.558999999999997}

{"chunk": "better spot now is it perfectly going to be parallel no but we want it working in that direction cuz now Club head's laying down appropriate amount of", "start": 494.44, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "rotation versus the arms lowering he's going to be in a much better spot to hit this ball so the drill is in piece is with piece number one being taking it up", "start": 502.84, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "to the top okay Piece One Piece two is starting a downswing where this pad feels like it's pushing into his right PE to about", "start": 512.0, "duration": 20.438}
{"chunk": "P5 and then from there piece number three is going to rock it back a little bit and Chip this ball out there and there you go I honestly love", "start": 521.399, "duration": 16.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "the fact that you caught it a little thin cuz that tells me the arms did not lower probably felt like you were looking at the ball this way yeah I really did like as I was getting into", "start": 531.76, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "the shot I was very uncomfortable I was like okay yeah very very much in a in a lot of side Bend there on my trail side so we're going to do that one more time I'm not going to walk you through it", "start": 540.2, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "we'll just have you demonstrate the pieces okay so up P4", "start": 548.24, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "P5 much better yeah and so what that really trains us to do is get the body rotating or the ribs rotating and this", "start": 556.48, "duration": 21.241}
{"chunk": "lead arm starts to work almost back so it's not us keeping the arms up and back but because the ribs start to rotate", "start": 566.36, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "into it you close this Gap so the arms stay up without you leaving them up that's another big thing we hear well I was told to leave my arms up and rotate", "start": 576.16, "duration": 19.160000000000004}
{"chunk": "maybe not the best description but you see that in players where the club's up here for a second and it has time to change its Dynamic yeah the club starts", "start": 586.68, "duration": 15.680000000000001}
{"chunk": "to passively shallow you always hear that like okay get the club to passively shallow yeah that's going to happen as the upper body and the ribs are starting", "start": 594.12, "duration": 16.758}
{"chunk": "to work appropriately or we're not actively trying to lower the club so now the club is allowed to fall into that spot yeah you hear all the time like get", "start": 602.399, "duration": 16.762}
{"chunk": "the club in the slot this in my opinion is what all the teachers before us were talk about this is how you get the club into the into the slot that's how it", "start": 610.88, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "happens and what's really cool is if you if you grabbed a water bottle is what you start to see with the arms is this Trail arm starts to work down and", "start": 619.399, "duration": 19.001}
{"chunk": "towards while the lead arm feels like it goes up and back so you get this little shallowing effect or when a force is applied on the club you get it to", "start": 628.72, "duration": 17.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "shallow but the arms relatively speaking stay up but the body has opened up so much more versus that's that's no good cuz now you're way up here and you're", "start": 638.0, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "tall yep so again kind of I wouldn't say myth busting but clarifying what people mean or meaning when they say", "start": 646.68, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "leave the arms up Shallow etc etc yeah we're not trying to keep the club up here and just turn we're trying to let the arms in the club passively work but", "start": 655.56, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "we're not actively putting them into a certain spot yes you get a little bit of more lead arm working internal so you can think elbow points more up towards", "start": 666.0, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "the sky or the lead Palm points more to the ground and this Trail arm starts to work down in front of you and again you're not sitting here going oh do this cuz now you're going to start to leak", "start": 673.519, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "into some extension it's just these passive things happen through some good rib rotation so now what I'd like you to do is we're going to do this in TW piece", "start": 682.399, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "you're going to go up to the top and from P4 you're going to try and feel that squeeze meaning that pad's going to go into your PE and then we're going to", "start": 691.8, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "hit this ball okay so4 pause start from there feel it push and then straight into the ball yep you're going to go from the top okay so up pause squeeze", "start": 699.12, "duration": 21.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "go yeah yeah and immediately I can feel myself again we're talking about where I'm feeling like I'm at an impact down I'm like way more here again exaggerated for me", "start": 710.44, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "but I'm way more in the shot for a lot longer than I am when I usually stand up yeah very cool you and I fall in the Campa we go from the top and it's always", "start": 719.92, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "been I mean we were always taught up one go two and it was always this so our arms were way faster than our body so then we get that extension starts to", "start": 726.92, "duration": 17.481}
{"chunk": "leak into some low back problems because we're just we're doing it inappropriately Y versus boom now we're in a good spot now the arms have all", "start": 736.56, "duration": 16.279}
{"chunk": "this free passage down to the ball so now what we're going to do if you don't have a g shallower linan stick we're going to put this underneath your right", "start": 744.279, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "armpit a portion is going to be underneath there make sure you guys squeeze it tight and it's in there so it'd be under the the trail arm right if we had a left a golfer be under the", "start": 752.76, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "trail so now what we're going to do is make a back swing up until the point the stick is on his arm which is usually right about lead arm parallel for most", "start": 760.8, "duration": 16.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "people yep we're going be right about P3 so from here if he's an arm poar this guy's coming off immediately and we know we're in trouble and you got immediate feedback so from here we got to do a", "start": 768.959, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "same movement as when we had the G shallower keep that stick on for as long as possible so we need rotation and we need a little bit", "start": 777.959, "duration": 15.960000000000003}
{"chunk": "more side Bend versus if you have the tendency to arm pull you're going to be in trouble yeah this is this is a drill and exercise I love to give students", "start": 785.76, "duration": 15.081000000000001}
{"chunk": "just because from a kinesthetic standpoint it's so cool to be able to get up obviously the lead arm parallel and just feel what the body has to do", "start": 793.36, "duration": 18.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "correct to maintain that connection correct right you're just like in slow motion I'm just trying to feel where's the where the ribs moving what are the arms doing to maintain that connection", "start": 802.8, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "it's really cool to just get that feedback immediately yeah and again someone gets this this drill and they're like man like it's really hard to hit golf balls well let's take a step back", "start": 812.16, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "and not even hit them you can sit in a mirror for hours and just play with that and like you said kinesthetically your body's like well the objective is to do", "start": 820.44, "duration": 19.680000000000003}
{"chunk": "this okay and things just start to happen again a lot of passive reactions occur without trying okay well I heard", "start": 829.44, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "to do this and this and and then all of a sudden you're like I'm so whacked out man I don't even want to like try anymore correct I know this is when you give a lot of students of your so walk", "start": 838.199, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "me through how you tell them to do this drill yeah so if I was if I was explaining this or giving this drill to a student I would immediately I always tell them to never start with a golf", "start": 846.759, "duration": 17.721}

{"chunk": "to feel the same thing lead arm up to parallel that felt pretty similar the reaction of the golf ball told me that that was pretty dang close to what I was", "start": 1034.36, "duration": 16.361}
{"chunk": "doing and what's great too is like for folks at home you take you take a video of maybe doing the drill once or twice with the stick another video without", "start": 1043.4, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "compare side by side and you go okay looks like I got to go back or you know what looks pretty similar let's keep grooving yep so just being in that constant Loop of okay where am I at how", "start": 1051.4, "duration": 16.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "well is this transferring do I need to make adjustments or not and then if you really feel like things are progressing with obviously these are very freezer drills like we're stopping at a certain", "start": 1059.48, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "point we're starting again if you feel really comfortable with that okay that last really like test to see how you're progressing is start at a dress get the", "start": 1068.36, "duration": 18.279}
{"chunk": "lead arm up to parallel back to the golf ball all in one fluid swing again how do I translate a drill to a full swing this is the best way to do it so I'm gonna", "start": 1077.32, "duration": 17.24}
{"chunk": "feel the same thing again the golf ball is not going to go more than 50 yards for me I'm trying to make the same speed same rate of same rate of energy in the", "start": 1086.159, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "swing but it's all just one fluid swing well what I love about it too is we're challenging folks to make full", "start": 1093.48, "duration": 17.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "range of motion relative to the drill but we got to dial back the speed yes and for guys who are gals who are really quick with the arms it's almost", "start": 1102.48, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "impossible because the arms they're meant to go fast that's where the power is at the bottom to deliver this golf ball or this golf club but to get you", "start": 1111.4, "duration": 15.879}
{"chunk": "into delivery we got again we got to match rotation rates versus the arms lowering y you got to really challenge yourself to be in conscious control of", "start": 1119.159, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "your speed of your swing throughout the entirety of the drill or your practice session because for a lot of people and some of my students it's like really the", "start": 1127.679, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "biggest challenge we have is just controlling the speed yep right and when people are used to yanking down the arms the the conscious level it takes to", "start": 1135.48, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "control that speed is it's tough very tough very tough so what I'm going to have you do the last one I got this from TC when use same thing alignment stick", "start": 1144.4, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "in a club you're going to take the club in your Trail hand just like me if I had an alignment stick I'd be holding it in my left hand resting it on my trail", "start": 1151.6, "duration": 17.638}
{"chunk": "elbow and it should also start to kind of settle in your lead elbow so you're going to be like this looking like me we're both elbows bingo", "start": 1161.039, "duration": 15.681999999999999}
{"chunk": "so now we're going to swing it to about lead arm parallel and then when you get there put your left hand on the", "start": 1169.0, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "club ah so it's relatively one you get to see where my arms at if you're too high you might find yourself or if you're too much that way so that's a little bonus you get to see but", "start": 1175.96, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "generally you're going to be here where the alignment stick will hold and you'll play with it to where it's you know 50/50 just balancing on my forearms yes so now we got to start transition how", "start": 1184.76, "duration": 19.56}
{"chunk": "long can the club or his hand stay up here in space but the outside part of the stick starts to tip back so if I were to sit here and help him he's going", "start": 1194.08, "duration": 18.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "to do Transition and can it fall back fall back fall back just crank it out as much as you can go go go go yeah and see how much higher his arms are but he's", "start": 1203.159, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "open so if he were to swing this stick is eventually going to fall back behind him but he's going to be falling into the inside so helping him again he's going to Max it out and look how much", "start": 1211.96, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "that club falls behind him are we really wanting him to do that no but if he's been an arm poar he's never had that feeling in his life that's not", "start": 1221.0, "duration": 16.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "we're going to Max it out because as soon as I introduce this golf ball this thing's going to Goat that much it's going to move fractionally correct exactly so we go up to the top I'll help", "start": 1229.2, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "you get set here and now he's going to try and leave the arms up forever Crank that stick back and tap this ball right check the tape probably", "start": 1237.919, "duration": 16.642000000000003}
{"chunk": "didn't fall too much but it did fall a little bit now we're going to do one incorrectly where he's just going to oh I can do that yeah he's just going to straight yank this club in the ground", "start": 1246.52, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "and what's nice is hopefully you guys can watch this back and see how does the how does the alignment stick react if he pulls down like chunk that's even better yeah", "start": 1255.4, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "it's even better so clear difference right lowering the arms and pulling down versus not so again what I really like about this", "start": 1264.24, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "drill in particular is how much it requires the arms to stay up but we still get the arms playing in", "start": 1273.48, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "space so this is where that I talked about the left arm feels or the lead arm goes up and back but the trail arm goes down and forward it leaks him into some", "start": 1282.76, "duration": 17.919}
{"chunk": "side bend the club reacts by laying down he's free and clear to drop this club on the ball so I that's how I would do that", "start": 1291.039, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "one get it set get it to react hit a ball same thing with your drill take the stick off do the yeah it's just", "start": 1299.96, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "progressing through yeah this one for me at least from from the three we've worked on this is probably the most uncomfortable one so this is probably the drill that I would have to spend the", "start": 1309.44, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "most time on without a golf ball to just feel myself work the club work the arms appropriately obviously check myself on video to make sure things are working", "start": 1317.36, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "appropriately and then introduce the golf ball I think a mistake that a lot of players get into is like they'll try to introduce the golf ball too quickly", "start": 1326.12, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "into a drill especially if it's a brand new movement pattern that they've been introduced to ex it's exciting you're on the Range you want to hit golf balls but in in reality like a lot of the stuff", "start": 1334.0, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "that we do here can be done in a garage in someone's backyard because again we're training lowering rates of the arms versus rotation rates of the chest", "start": 1343.48, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "that's not something that we need the golf ball to give us feedback on no that's the the feedback comes from the video camera that we record ourselves on", "start": 1353.52, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "or the mirror that we practice into obviously introducing the golf ball Pro provides an extra layer of feedback but it's not that direct feedback", "start": 1360.88, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "correct guys thank you so much for watching this video a quick shout out to Tyler C TC he's been a great resource", "start": 1369.159, "duration": 16.681}
