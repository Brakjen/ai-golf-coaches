{"chunk": "stay high so as I stay dropped inside ankle bone goes in here why I love teaching players this and and most of the time like if I see", "start": 694.519, "duration": 18.722}

{"chunk": "supporting what I my intention is in my ribs my arms my hands and the club okay our term passive simply means", "start": 822.0, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "that it's responsive okay so like let's let's say that I have like we talk often about this idea of like passive release this", "start": 831.199, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "is Active Release like I'm suating here to throw this club down my coronal plane this is an I'm actively sending it over here now as I", "start": 839.56, "duration": 15.839000000000002}

{"chunk": "when it comes to ground reaction force which again it's a kind of a silly Force cuz like we're going to have it like if you get on a scale there's numbers that", "start": 911.24, "duration": 19.201}

{"chunk": "Earth how much do you weigh zero zero you don't weigh anything if you had a scale like right on you like if I was here just Dro into the Earth", "start": 956.56, "duration": 16.44}
