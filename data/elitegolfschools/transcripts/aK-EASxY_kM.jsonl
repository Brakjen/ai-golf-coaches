{"chunk": "what's nice you've moved in in a in a few different ways that's really really important especially the transitional phase go ahead and go into the back swing again lateral", "start": 263.96, "duration": 19.439}

{"chunk": "transition kind of what would have been P5 mhm into the there you go that would be roughly delivery so the golf club would be back in here in space and now", "start": 332.44, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "as you start to turn turn turn turn turn turn the golf club would look like it's in here and you've gone all the way from like somewhat into the toes definitely in the balls of your foot all the way", "start": 341.12, "duration": 19.118}
{"chunk": "into like the outermost yeah yep that's all rotation and turn from these lead joints curving out of there uhhuh so what's happening down here in the foot", "start": 350.199, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "complex is really driven by what we're doing in the upper spiral exactly okay when we're kind of going into this even deeper like the sequence of this", "start": 359.72, "duration": 16.6}

{"chunk": "yeah and just well and I think even maybe uh cuz blending sounds like they all happen at once which they they don't right there's still a sequence but we're", "start": 420.72, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "just buffing off the transitional areas of each movement so it's a smooth transition in between each movement instead of lateral Rotation by no means", "start": 428.759, "duration": 18.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "are we saying it's position position position right it's it all flows in between yep exactly which we need to have the only thing that's that's difficult is transition because we have", "start": 437.919, "duration": 19.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "the lateral movement of the ribs yep and the drop of the pelvis happening at the same time same time so have two simple movements like this is not that complex", "start": 447.4, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "no this is not complex nope right but when they happen together it's like rubbing the top of your head and your stomach in opposite directions at the", "start": 456.72, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "same time each Act is simple yeah but you've got to be able to manage the drop and the lateral movement of the ribs definitely yep yep so um in doing this", "start": 464.44, "duration": 19.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "let's hit a couple of shots here I think this would be a nice way to go ahead and start blending this let's hit a couple of shots like a 100 yards out there okay", "start": 474.8, "duration": 15.318999999999999}
{"chunk": "TJ's got six iron and typically you hit 6 iron 200 yards or so about that y okay and with a club let's see the freezer", "start": 482.159, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "first okay so let's go lateral first good wonderful and this was a test for you actually notice how the grip and the", "start": 489.319, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "club head didn't move MH okay you moved the ribs into this Trail humorous the golf club isn't firing off over here", "start": 498.319, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "beautiful now as you turn excellent now the golf club starts to go ahead and work back and TJ does this really well as well see how he Leverage", "start": 506.96, "duration": 15.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "The Golf Club there's certain amount of extension some amount of pronation little bit of radio like just to get the golf club leveraged here and if you", "start": 514.959, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "wanted the lead arm to lift as well just to get to the top you're more than welcome to do that beautiful now from there we would see drop and the lateral", "start": 523.88, "duration": 19.24}
{"chunk": "movement of the ribs going this way there's there's beautiful transition now we would just turn all the way up into", "start": 533.12, "duration": 15.359000000000002}
{"chunk": "finish while letting the golf club unload beautiful let's see that again just in freezers so we got", "start": 541.279, "duration": 15.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "one two 3 4 beautiful that was", "start": 548.92, "duration": 16.679}
{"chunk": "excellent now let's see that let's see it in a practice swing first right next to it all the time that you need just to", "start": 556.959, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "feel the movement the sequence of movement but we're buffing off all the transitional spaces there one 2 3", "start": 564.959, "duration": 23.0}
{"chunk": "4 beautiful now hit one at that same Pace great one two 3 four beautiful now", "start": 574.839, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "the question here is did you make the movements that you sought to make right and were they buffed off in", "start": 587.24, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "sequence mhm great that's excellent let's do that one more time and then we'll show a posterior view of this lateral", "start": 597.44, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "rotation drop sway turn beautiful beautiful K one more with a little bit more energy there so now", "start": 609.079, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "we'll go ahead and amp it up so we hit it 150 yards but 150 is like 75% of your max at 100 right right okay same", "start": 617.959, "duration": 19.161}
{"chunk": "movement same sequence you're just managing the energy beautiful what a great way to practice cuz at that pace", "start": 627.32, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "too you can really feel this movement then this movement then this movement then this one there's enough time mhm to", "start": 636.68, "duration": 16.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "go ahead and like I did it or I didn't yeah right that's fantastic so we got face on let's go ahead and see what this looks like from poster okay T go ahead", "start": 645.56, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "and hold it Clos line Style again so one of the really nice points in space to take a look at don't mind me back", "start": 654.32, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "here sacrum tailbone okay so show us the lateral rotation great now we're going to drop and", "start": 661.639, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "sway good and then all the way to finish from there beautiful okay so let's take a look at where that sacrum really is", "start": 672.079, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "moving in space let's do this Dynamic now okay with the clothes line still okay but we're feeling this all the edges are buffed off", "start": 681.32, "duration": 16.281}
{"chunk": "lateral rotation drop sway turn great so in slowing that down we'll", "start": 689.8, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "be able to see where the sacrum is moving in space MH and what we'll typically see with our our favorite movers from this view here this", "start": 699.12, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "posterior view is the sacrum will just barely move lateral to start away from the target but then from that point forward and some people don't even in", "start": 705.76, "duration": 18.76}
{"chunk": "the back swing it'll just stay and then it progresses ly work towards the target into P5 P5 is it's like furthest forward", "start": 716.2, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "because we've got quite a bit of pressure into the lead side M right in delivery so that now I can go ahead and curve away from there the guys that hit", "start": 724.839, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "at the furthest the guys that are our favorite movers from P5 all the way to like p7 impact their sacrum moves the", "start": 732.68, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "most their tailbone moves the most away from the target so as we move into the transition here that's p yep so we're", "start": 740.639, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "the furthest forward that it has been so if we just go from here okay just from here go back to aess see how much", "start": 749.76, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "further forward it is that was substantially like four or five inches further forward there you go now as you start to curve the ribs rotating the", "start": 757.56, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "ribs there goes the sacrum back at me beautiful and there's impact and that moves substantially uhhuh quite our favorite movers like Ricky great mover", "start": 766.16, "duration": 20.76}
{"chunk": "DJ great mover like those guys their Sacra moves the most but you'll see it like gradually and it's not this like fake out I got to get it up here it's", "start": 776.12, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "because I'm turning in space okay the pelvis moved and rotated because the upper made it so now my my sacrum is the", "start": 785.68, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "furthest forward that it ever will be at five I'm here dropped in now I'm going to curve boom and there it goes away yeah right and what we're not really", "start": 794.16, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "trying to make it go towards and away because of lateral movement in the pelvis no again the only thing that the pelvis is really doing actively is", "start": 803.36, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "dropping is dropping so by staying dropped As you move Lateral with the ribs that's going to create some of that sacred move that we're seeing exactly", "start": 811.639, "duration": 16.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "it's just a really nice point in space to just pay attention to because it can kind of be a tell for how's the pelvis moving it also can kind of leak and you", "start": 820.279, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "can kind of see how uh the rib unit is working as well for sure okay so let's see another one here but with a golf club now okay and let's see a pieced out", "start": 828.24, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "uh progressional sequence movement exercise where we're feeling lateral to start now we're going to", "start": 837.48, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "turn good now we'd go drop and Sway and now from there you just turn but where's that that sacrum going as you work all", "start": 845.32, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "the way into finish beautiful that's excellent okay so let's do that again let's hit this one about 100 yards or so and then we'll just pick up the steam", "start": 853.759, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "all buffed off same movements same sequences nice and buffed off between each sequence beautiful okay now let's see one about", "start": 862.959, "duration": 18.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "150 yards or so again we're keeping these buffed off we're just playing with the energy that you're putting into the", "start": 876.72, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "system beautiful that was freaking hit so good that was flush yep okay now let's hit one", "start": 887.24, "duration": 16.281}
{"chunk": "stock same movements same same sequence of movements manage the", "start": 896.48, "duration": 15.318}
{"chunk": "energy beautiful what a great look so curious in doing that performing those exercises can you start to sense like", "start": 903.279, "duration": 16.602}
{"chunk": "where things are moving just a little bit better where sacrum is moving where pelvis is at ribs definitely just having an awareness of those two areas in", "start": 913.04, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "particular um I can feel that as I'm finishing the turn here I'm not just keeping moving in this direction I'm", "start": 920.56, "duration": 15.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "allowing the sacrum to curve back yep which pulls me up into the Finish yes exactly so definitely increasing the awareness of that yep yep yep so let's do this again from a lateral perspective", "start": 928.16, "duration": 19.319}
{"chunk": "and we'll we'll showcase one or uh just holding onto your clothes line okay okay so here's where Noggin starts okay let's", "start": 937.959, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "go ahead and start moving good and now we're going to turn from there beautiful now from here go ahead and drop back in good now your", "start": 947.12, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "head is slightly further forward than than it was at the start that's because the center mass of the ribs move further forward than they were at a dress right", "start": 956.8, "duration": 16.76}
{"chunk": "this is the furthest forward your head ever needs to be so now as you curve it's almost as if your head is on a wall there you go and youd stand all the way", "start": 965.24, "duration": 18.878}
{"chunk": "up as you go into your finish there you go and you'll notice right there there's a little relief late and the head floats forward it's totally fine it's way late", "start": 974.759, "duration": 18.362}
{"chunk": "we're talking from five all the way through to like nine uhhuh the head doesn't move forward it just stays on this wall gotcha for driver it", "start": 982.72, "duration": 18.64}

{"chunk": "going to keep moving laterally through the strike all the way in the Finish it's like no your lateral is done up in P5 from there you've got to be moving", "start": 1019.759, "duration": 15.68}
