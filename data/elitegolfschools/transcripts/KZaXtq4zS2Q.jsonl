{"chunk": "spend three hours on just this topic but in general let's let's let's come about this from like uh ground reaction force or like if I'm standing on a a a", "start": 2589.68, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "pressure mat so I can see where pressure is moving okay um so number one what I prefer to see this isn't 100% but my", "start": 2599.44, "duration": 20.52}
{"chunk": "preference is to see players that at the address position they're up over the top of the golf ball more and you can see from here like my heels are almost", "start": 2609.28, "duration": 17.798}
{"chunk": "coming off the ground right now so I definitely have a bias into my toes or into the balls of my feet okay so I'm not starting here where I'm back like", "start": 2618.359, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "you can definitely see that now I've got like all this heel pressure so the reason being is in", "start": 2626.599, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "movement it's like in the name we are moving from one point to another point no no no no no I would like to see", "start": 2633.559, "duration": 19.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "people continue to pressure more and more into the heels throughout the entirety of their swing in general okay", "start": 2643.92, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "so th this has to do more with like the the shapes of of um of like Spiral tissue as well as like proper drops so", "start": 2651.48, "duration": 18.681}
{"chunk": "if we start with this drop if I'm if I'm in a squat rack right now and I drop most um proper trainers even go eyes up knees don't pitch forward so your booty", "start": 2661.24, "duration": 19.239}
{"chunk": "drops in this space so if I'm on that pressure mat right now where does it look like the pressure is moving pretty clear to see that it's moving more like", "start": 2670.599, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "heel bias right I'm not going this way that's toe bias it's here so that's one moves this way number two spiral tissue", "start": 2679.599, "duration": 19.162}
{"chunk": "anterior space and then it goes right in here underneath this armpit and look at the direction that it's traveling it's right through here so if I pull on that", "start": 2689.0, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "tissue like if I had a crane pulling on this like this lat or like my rib cage right here this tissue would be", "start": 2698.359, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "pulled that way away from the ball so if I'm on my heels already and I'm getting pulled in this direction I can't stay in Balance there", "start": 2706.24, "duration": 19.76}
{"chunk": "but if I'm on if I'm over like on the balls of my feet toe bias and I start to get pulled in that direction totally fine if I drop I can move in that", "start": 2717.119, "duration": 16.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "direction and then if if you're my target I have the same looking spiral line on the other side right so this spiral tissue gets", "start": 2725.8, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "pulled this way now what's really cool when you think about the golf swing is if I want to take this instrument and I", "start": 2733.4, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "want to shoot it both out and down on that plane this way this is the active hit I want to be able to support that", "start": 2742.8, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "especially through the swing like through the strike so if I'm in here and I drop in turn but look at where all this this is shooting these ribs are", "start": 2751.64, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "pulling here look at where the golf club can unload so they balance each other but if you watch my head like throughout the course of the Swing so definitely", "start": 2759.839, "duration": 15.841999999999999}
{"chunk": "more like on the on the balls of my feet toe bias I'm going to get pulled away drop away pull away so there's not a time where I'm invading and falling this", "start": 2767.72, "duration": 20.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "way so if we're looking at that movement and how would it translate to like", "start": 2776.839, "duration": 15.442}
{"chunk": "quantitative data in foot pressure we would see a shape where if this is the target line and let's say the like I've got", "start": 2784.92, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "foot and foot here so ball of the foot ball of the foot so my pressure starts right here we would see it go away away", "start": 2795.28, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "away almost like an S back swing transition when I drop and then through swing it would almost work away again so", "start": 2802.52, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "I'm going away away away so I'm always pulled away and you'll even see this on the PG tour if somebody loses balance at", "start": 2810.8, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "the Finish they'll look more like this so they step back in this space you'll never see somebody swing and fall", "start": 2820.04, "duration": 17.36}

{"chunk": "there's a driver a ton that's where they if they lose balance and step they're stepping away more heel bias that's a", "start": 2839.52, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "good way to look at it okay the only other topic that I'd love to take a look at too here is if we're looking at just health and movement like in the feet", "start": 2847.04, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "which is a great way to help um control the pelvis as well as like the femurs and how they move in general it would be", "start": 2855.96, "duration": 17.998}
{"chunk": "awesome to always see the pressure stay more on the Outer Rim outer edge of the foot so it never gets on the InStep see", "start": 2865.359, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "this this is this is couple things add adduction of the femur that makes this foot pronate so it shoves the arch to the", "start": 2873.04, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "ground okay so that act is also going to shove the pelvis forward and it'll look like this so banking is a common term", "start": 2882.88, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "for it I just don't like the movement because I'm always trying to keep somebody's pelvis more underneath them so they can turn and burn on top of that", "start": 2890.72, "duration": 16.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "so if I'm moving here and I turn and I'm looking this way like now I'm going to go ahead and land even here I've got pressure on the outer edge of this foot", "start": 2898.72, "duration": 20.558}
{"chunk": "and the same thing here still so and you can really see like if I drop and get ready to go out of there look you can see like this bow out where the spiral", "start": 2909.599, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "lines on on each leg are engaged if I'm on a pressure mat right now we're going to see the pressure on the outer edge of this foot and the outer edge of this foot and even going all the way up into", "start": 2918.319, "duration": 16.922}
{"chunk": "the finish right now I've got pressure on the last three digits of this foot and the pressure never got on the big toe so", "start": 2927.68, "duration": 18.999}
{"chunk": "I'm here and I'm going outer three edges from down the line would look like that rather than", "start": 2936.839, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "banking is this kind of a look so it'll get shoved on the InStep roll up on the big toe and the pressure never gets on on the outer like three digits and", "start": 2945.799, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "definitely not on the Outer Edge that's the preference do you have to be exactly like that no you do not but you want to be careful with how much of this", "start": 2954.88, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "adduction how much banking you throw in because at the end end of the day it influences the pelvis and all this lateral movement the pelvis whereas if I", "start": 2963.319, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "go in here see how pelvis stays underneath me outer edge Outer Edge keep on motoring keep it on the Outer Edge you'll never lose the pelvis too", "start": 2971.68, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "laterally with that type of a map hopefully that answers those questions yes sir I think we might have time for one more short one yeah let's", "start": 2979.52, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "do like a little quickie right here especially because we started a little bit a little bit late today all right so this one's from Jamie Chen um cool can", "start": 2988.0, "duration": 18.0}

{"chunk": "swing in your short game is way away from what you're building in your full swing so two totally different patterns one so it's hard to match that up um but", "start": 3097.88, "duration": 20.84}
