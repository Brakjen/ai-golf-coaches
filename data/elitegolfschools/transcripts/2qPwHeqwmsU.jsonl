{"chunk": "[Music] it I'm excited I'm excited too you texted me about this one um I did the", "start": 9.5, "duration": 19.34}
{"chunk": "reason for this is is a better understanding of rotation and the direction it's moving okay and it moves vertical", "start": 19.88, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "always rotation moves vertical there's a vertical bias to rotation okay let's uh", "start": 28.199, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "let's Okay I I okay so what I what I am describing here and we talk about this quite often is the spiral line right right so if if we're just following the", "start": 35.32, "duration": 20.279}
{"chunk": "spiral line and we start from a let's just neglect the lower the lower half from right now so so upper spiral upper spiral so from my belt line up got it TJ", "start": 45.559, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "spiral will start right here yep okay there's another one over there obviously yep but for right here starts right here on this hip complex the outer side of the the hip complex goes across his", "start": 55.84, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "abdomen underneath the armpit under the armp pit over the scal and up like right underneath his skull got it and hence", "start": 65.04, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "spiral it goes up it goes up okay okay and it's not you could go well obviously it goes you could follow it down and run that Highway and you could do that", "start": 73.6, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "highway so it could go no it doesn't go down no why doesn't it go down because when we're turning either direction so if I'm", "start": 83.28, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "going to my back swing or if I'm going in my forward swing it is always from the top that is that is looking to work", "start": 92.32, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "away from the lower half so in essence like right up here underneath my skull yes is the start of the Spiral line yes so if I'm loading a spiral line just", "start": 99.92, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "like I would load a rubber band it extends and stretches so from this point to this point is elongating okay this is the very most", "start": 108.92, "duration": 19.559}
{"chunk": "Port upper portion of the Spiral yeah so if we're talking here okay going down over the scal under the armpit and then across to TJ's neighbor so it's like", "start": 118.2, "duration": 18.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "down to the scap then across to the lead hip yes okay so what you're what you're doing is you're elongating from that", "start": 127.719, "duration": 16.761}
{"chunk": "lead hip essentially to that exactly so even like if I'm if I'm walking so if I wanted to pull this left leg at the camera okay I would I would really pull", "start": 135.959, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "from my head like see how see how my head's like going it's it's moving in this shap shape yeah so I've got some amount of of of uh lead side Bend", "start": 145.36, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "lateral Bend in the SE sepine that has worked up and it's pulling pulling up in this in this fashion here yeah see it's C spine all the way down the scap and", "start": 155.08, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "it's really easy to see it from the armpit across the abdomen to this hip this shape that all expand right yes you see it it elongates sure this distance", "start": 164.12, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "gets further away or or this distance is elongated because this point gets further away from this point woo yeah czy okay so if I do that in Gate pattern", "start": 173.0, "duration": 17.078}
{"chunk": "even it's this way to pull this forward to land and then I'd go the opposite way right you see like really good sprinters like that's their yeah yeah exactly all", "start": 181.599, "duration": 17.722}
{"chunk": "that stuff in the lower half we've talked a lot about that but the fact is if this the uppermost spiral line is the", "start": 191.0, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "initiator of movement and the initiator of rotation yeah yeah there's the away yeah if it's", "start": 199.799, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "going to elongate it's going to move you away right because it's not it's not like the spiral it's not it wouldn't be a spiral if it was just yeah straight across this way you just be going this", "start": 208.599, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "way like a top yeah yeah which you look at that and you're like that's not a good movement you look at this and you're like oh that guy looks better than this guy he does okay", "start": 217.239, "duration": 19.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "so if that happens so in essence we've got this vertical look to the rotation okay it causes extension", "start": 226.879, "duration": 21.12}
{"chunk": "sure yeah extension is a great thing gosh I'm so glad we're covering cuz so many students message me they're like why can't I stop extending", "start": 236.64, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "I'm like you're supposed to you are supposed to and by the way you're supposed to extend here's where you can extend you can extend from", "start": 246.12, "duration": 21.24}
{"chunk": "P1 okay so position one is a dress all the way really to about P3 and the extension is because this distance I'm", "start": 255.6, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "pulling here this distance is elongating see how my pelvis isn't really doing much yet but then as I keep pressuring that and pulling it it is going to pull on this", "start": 265.639, "duration": 17.001}
{"chunk": "hip complex oh yeah I feel it there it goes and so this is working into an extension State yep okay and I'm not saying that we look like this and it's", "start": 274.16, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "just like artificial like right no it's because the upper spiral demands that it hold on right that also", "start": 281.84, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "extends extends the spine to some degree yep it it's it's all a a response yes exactly so you can extend from P1 to P3", "start": 290.68, "duration": 21.401}
{"chunk": "okay and you can extend from P4 to P Infinity uhuh the space to drop yeah is", "start": 299.96, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "P3 to P4 yeah that's that's our dropped right and again we talk about this a ton the pelvis doesn't like it's not in", "start": 309.6, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "command of rotation we talk about it from time to time and understanding pivots and oh yeah of course there's there's rotation in it but it is we're", "start": 320.319, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "seeing the spiral line create that rotation for the most part and we got to bounce back and forth between Spirals and D that's in a lot of our transition are which is why the spiral line is such", "start": 329.8, "duration": 18.040000000000003}
{"chunk": "a beautiful model because it's got both rotation and extension in it yes and if you just follow that model you're going to knock two birds out with one stone", "start": 338.96, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "right exactly so we're not rotating the pelvis and extending exact it's exactly spiral right yep so if we just did this", "start": 347.759, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "te why don't we uh let's do a three-part swing okay and you are going to allow your pelvis to extend it's not an active move", "start": 355.56, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "it's a passive move but you're not trying to trap it down at all from P1 to P3 we're going to use the upper spiral to work in a vertical manner so even", "start": 365.56, "duration": 18.759}
{"chunk": "your hat level should heighten there you go good and P3 would be right in there got it okay now from here let's let the", "start": 374.639, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "lead arm continue to lift and you're going to drop as you do that there you go so now you've dropped in now from here brother this spiral line is going", "start": 382.72, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "to pull you in a vertical manner look at that trail hip start to extend appropriately it's appropriate extension it's going to extend through the strike", "start": 392.52, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "everybody that's worth a dam is extending so people have this like poor conception of of early extension they do", "start": 400.919, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "that they just forget the word early and just say extension is bad yeah so early extension is just from P3 to P4 we're", "start": 409.0, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "actively rotating the pelvis which causes the ex exension from P3 to P4 yeah there you go P3 to P4 we're just", "start": 417.039, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "dropping there you go but now from there we're extending there exactly and it's everybody feels this differently like", "start": 424.52, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "for sure some players that are like massive extenders will feel as if they stay dropped in but they're actually not 100% if they're good yeah okay you're", "start": 432.84, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "never going to see this like Drop and then somebody stays in this flexion State all the way through the strike this is ridiculous it's the same amount amount of flection that I that I had and", "start": 442.0, "duration": 17.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "Dro I see some students that maybe have that interpretation and that messes with them dude they can't get the ball in the air anymore can't get the ball in the air they can't they have no room through", "start": 451.0, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "the strike to unload it plus like this is just a really nice way to see where how the center of mass of the club uhuh", "start": 459.12, "duration": 15.559000000000001}
{"chunk": "and my center of mass should coexist and marry yeah like early my center of mass is heightening and I'm trying to get the center on mass going away from me they", "start": 466.08, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "worked in opposition there they went here oh interesting now from here the golf club's going to work up and away well guess where I'm going so it's going", "start": 476.12, "duration": 17.758}
{"chunk": "here and I'm dropping back the other side but now don't we te with the tool through the hit don't we want the energy to shoot out this way so where do I have", "start": 485.199, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "to go to counter that away from this has to work up and away this way to be able to give room for that to happen and we see that out of every single high level", "start": 494.039, "duration": 20.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "golf swing yeah so the whole look of rotation is vertical it's here I've rotated right now like eventually the golf club's going to get up here to", "start": 504.52, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "about 3 and now I'm dropping as the golf club finishes uh there's my flexion State there you go but now from here up up up up up as the golf club shoots out", "start": 513.88, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "yeah cool you see that in everybody right you do you do you have have to have that yeah in high level players yes", "start": 523.399, "duration": 15.200999999999999}
{"chunk": "so it's just the description of this is rotation is always in a vertical Direction so let's overdo this to really show this okay so go ahead and set up to it", "start": 530.839, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "I can overdo things yeah baby let's do it and here's a very easy way to to sense this this shoulder complex I want", "start": 540.0, "duration": 15.158999999999999}
{"chunk": "you to move it as far away as you can through the spiral line away from this lead foot okay let's do that", "start": 547.399, "duration": 17.520999999999997}
{"chunk": "again there we go so see how high this got almost feels like you you you heighten so your hat there you go do that again just to three good now show", "start": 562.48, "duration": 20.88}
{"chunk": "three to four good now we're going to smoothly chip this but this is going to work up away and your Hat's going to", "start": 572.68, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "heighten to hit uhhuh so kind of a three piecer yep three piecer show to three show to", "start": 580.32, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "four show to finish beautiful see how easy the golf club like it has to shoot it has to shoot out it gives me a", "start": 589.48, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "re to shoot it out cuz I'm going away exactly yeah for sure so this this this look is almost like when we're looking at just shoulder complex shoulder", "start": 599.12, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "complex this shoulder complex should not lower early in the back swing it should stay high and the trail shoulder should", "start": 607.959, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "work away there we go that gives you room room to drop at four and then we'd have the same thing once we're dropped", "start": 615.72, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "into four the right shoulder isn't isn't lowering to get into the strike the lead shoulder is heightening see the difference in like what what my legs", "start": 625.24, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "look like like now I have appropriate extension not because I'm jumping so a lot of people mess that one up when they're trying to like shallow as they're like my right shoulder needs to", "start": 634.279, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "go down I'm whack now it's an unhealthy pattern you got all these problems right you can't control the bottom M can't", "start": 642.88, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "control the face so we're here dropped in yep here's the heightening but as soon as this heightens guess what I can do with the club shoot it out exactly", "start": 650.12, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "it's also not a cast no it's just a really casting is an optical illusion it's an optical illusion the golf club is here if I internally rotate this and", "start": 659.279, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "lower it it looks like I just threw the golf club away uhhuh because right here it doesn't look like from the camera angle this is 90\u00b0 of shaft load yeah if", "start": 669.48, "duration": 17.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "I lower this it's still 90\u00b0 of shaft load but it looks like from a face on perspective that that's a cast sure whereas if I'm here and this internally", "start": 677.959, "duration": 17.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "rotates some this looks like I've I've lagged uhhuh right all that we're doing in this in this transitionary phase is dropping and the golf club does work in", "start": 687.0, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "here but from here dude you every single dang player that's worth a darn is unloading the golf club as they're turning this does not look like a cast", "start": 695.2, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "it goes because you you're creating the space because of the Spiral line through the strike AB giving yourself a reason to extend which you need to do through", "start": 704.72, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "the strike M appropriate extensions cuz the upper spiral is demanding that and all that leaves room for the golf club to unload you shoot the center of mass", "start": 713.56, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "out yeah yeah that's cool that's cool okay now let's see two piece so we'll go through three to four if that makes", "start": 722.639, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "sense so one to four and one one move good beautiful it's so so much easier to", "start": 731.279, "duration": 18.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "unload the golf club too absolutely it just shoots okay okay now let's see from one to finish okay there's a vertical move", "start": 745.04, "duration": 18.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "immediately because of rotation and because of the Spiral line You'll drop an appropriate amount but then we're back to Vertical from the the start of the the", "start": 754.48, "duration": 20.84}
{"chunk": "forward swing onward got it look look how easy the club shot yeah it's awesome yeah okay so the the", "start": 763.839, "duration": 20.802}
{"chunk": "point of this and why I was excited for this like little short video is it is like we're not leveling rotation you", "start": 779.8, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "don't need to fight more side Bend sure you just need to understand that as you're rotating you should be going vertical and just that matchup is like", "start": 787.32, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "okay if I'm here and I'm as soon as I rotate so it's not like I rotate and then I'm just turning and working vertical that's the look I'm rotating", "start": 795.56, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "here this is away see how this Trail shoulder has worked away from the lead m now I can drop that's the same thing here lead shoulder", "start": 805.12, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "away from the trail I'm rotating I'm working vertical and I would just keep working through there all the way to finish it's seamless yes there is a", "start": 813.16, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "vertical nature to rotation don't stay freaking dropped in you don't need to stay dropped in for that long no you don't in actuality in actuality yeah", "start": 821.32, "duration": 16.959}
