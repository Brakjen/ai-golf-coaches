{"chunk": "it the D plane is this this rope we have set up right yep what is the significance of the D plane like why why should anyone even be concerned about it", "start": 14.519, "duration": 15.961}
{"chunk": "really yeah uh the D plane essentially is heavily related to your club path um so how the golf club operates into the", "start": 22.56, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "golf ball and out from the golf ball in post impact is essentially your d-plane so if you struggle with with path issues", "start": 31.359, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "or or ball flight issues or if you just want to understand the ball flight laws um d-plane is essential to understand on how you get the Golf Club operating on", "start": 39.8, "duration": 18.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "that curve or off of that curve by changing and and adjusting your swing and movement so it is a curve like the the D plane is a is a curve structure um", "start": 49.16, "duration": 19.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "that already you know there there's some people out there that are very linear in their thinking of how this golf swing Works maybe they're trying to keep this club", "start": 59.239, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "head moving down the line for a really really long time right and then maybe they're trying to get it exiting down the line for for a long time as well so", "start": 66.96, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "golf swing operates on a curve and that curve is the D plane y as we're describing it okay so basically if I was going to hit a", "start": 75.96, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "fade using the D plane I would want to get the golf club on the outside of the D plane early and then on the inside of the D plane late so in other words I'm", "start": 84.52, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "more so focused on getting the path of the D plane on the left side rather than trying to follow the path of the D plane on the entry Additionally you know from", "start": 94.56, "duration": 20.521}
{"chunk": "you know when I land in transition from here I can really feel like my sternum opens up relatively dramatically and", "start": 104.24, "duration": 16.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "then my sacrum also starts to face back where the camera is that really allows me to get on top of this golf ball and create a little bit more of a wiping", "start": 112.399, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "pattern so I can start the ball left and fit it got it so I mean there's a lot of rotation in that type of a move right so yep sternum you know point point right", "start": 122.399, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "under underneath the chest here right right next to the heart that's sternum and then sacrum I'm not sure everyone's familiar with that term sacrum is like", "start": 132.16, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "tailbone right yep so what you're saying if we're going to hit a cut is we're going to get sternum and sacrum starting", "start": 140.319, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "to flash maybe open early yes yep yep so sacrum would be going to your right as sternum is going to your left got it yep", "start": 147.36, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "is that is that kind of a good depiction of what you're looking there yeah absolutely and just keep opening up there boom got it yep okay y so that", "start": 157.2, "duration": 16.359}
{"chunk": "would be kind of DPL awareness of what to do with the middle of your body absolutely for a cut yep can you hit one just just cut so I can maybe see what", "start": 164.959, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "that looks like yeah good do one more and I I think maybe a cool thing to also point out here is you can modify ball position a", "start": 172.879, "duration": 20.801}
{"chunk": "little bit too to sort of manipulate the Deep planes so you know if he if Tyler wants that club tracking more on this", "start": 186.239, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "leftward part of the arc we could bump the ball position a little bit further forward in a stance too right absolutely okay so let's let's do that same move just ball up towards kind of the lead", "start": 195.12, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "heel yeah and that will definitely help me get it on the the Left Turn part of the arc right leftward path The Arc there", "start": 204.36, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "yep nice yeah much easier to cut it go so that's kind of a cool cool feel cuz I think you know a lot of people if they're trying to hit these different shots with without you know the", "start": 215.159, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "awareness of what to do with the ball m in your stance a setup like there's maybe some over manipulations and they might they might struggle with that yeah", "start": 224.84, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "like if we're going to get the sacrum and sternum floating open a little bit earlier well then that's going to move the Arc of my", "start": 233.239, "duration": 15.441}
{"chunk": "D plane more left it's also going to move the low Point further forward further up yeah yeah yeah so if", "start": 240.48, "duration": 16.638}
{"chunk": "you got that ball in the back of your stance trying to do that you you might struggle right yeah there you go y you might be coming out of it yeah yep so", "start": 249.239, "duration": 20.641}
{"chunk": "let's talk draw okay so so draw what are you doing with the D plane how are you manipulating you know essentially the exact opposite um I don't want a whole", "start": 258.799, "duration": 19.721}
{"chunk": "lot of early rotation in my body um I don't want to flash my sacrum back very early because that's just going to kick the golf club um out over the plane so I", "start": 268.68, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "need to do everything in my power to make sure that my hands and arms in the club fall kind of on the entry part of the D plane here okay so so more towards", "start": 278.0, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "this side of the D plane Y and then you know how that might relate to sternum and pelvis would you say it's accurate that you're going to basically try to stay closed off for longer yeah okay", "start": 287.0, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "let's see what that looks like just give me kind of a slow-mo rep there mock yeah same same idea kind of through P5 P6", "start": 296.84, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "okay and and show me the sort of draw orientation nice and then show me the cut orientation one more time just so the audience can get an idea of the", "start": 303.12, "duration": 16.758000000000003}
{"chunk": "differences beautiful so that's cut here's draw nice now also with draw like again opposite in terms of ball position and", "start": 313.479, "duration": 17.563000000000002}
{"chunk": "setup you know we can bump that ball position back in the stance a little bit to allow us to come more from that inside part of the arc is that right mhm", "start": 325.4, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "okay absolutely absolutely and then the kind of the secret sauce to both of these things here that really helps um perception is you know for the draw I", "start": 334.56, "duration": 19.478}
{"chunk": "want to do everything in my power to create space in this area of the golf swing right and then in the fade I want", "start": 344.919, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "to do everything in my power to create space in this area of the golf swing oh that's a really cool visual that's really cool visual hang on let's do that", "start": 353.24, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "from face on okay so withraw you're saying all the the space you want to create basically is is in is in here right cuz that's where you want these", "start": 361.08, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "arms hands elbow Club kind of falling into as this space yep so that it can start to shoot more out through the", "start": 369.88, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "strike yep and then with a cut you're not as much concerned with this space as you are with this space correct okay yep", "start": 377.36, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "yep great so now all the space is on Tyler's front of his body so he can get that handle get that club arcing left", "start": 385.96, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "around the D plane for right-handed player obviously absolutely cool yeah it's kind of like you know how much space am I going to hedge on each side", "start": 394.56, "duration": 16.039}
{"chunk": "of the D plane right more space on the right side of the midline equals draw I stay closed I let my arms go go across", "start": 402.199, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "me more space on the left side of the midline open up a little bit more of a wiping pattern yeah yeah so let's see", "start": 409.72, "duration": 16.999}
{"chunk": "the draw real quick okay stay closed let the arms go across if you like little tight draws like that y baby draw all right which", "start": 418.08, "duration": 17.198}
{"chunk": "one you want me to do first uh let's do the fade first ball forward dramatic opening of the sacrum and stiring them at the same time feel like the club goes", "start": 431.759, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "along the left side of that d-e there okay so in here yep yeah nice little fade nice little", "start": 441.12, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "fade yeah okay yeah and then draw yeah so here from the top landing", "start": 450.72, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "on the left keeping your your sternum and your sacrum Clos as long as possible allowing those arms to go across your", "start": 459.199, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "chest feeling like the golf club swings on the right side of the midline okay ball back a little bit", "start": 468.199, "duration": 16.722}
{"chunk": "Beauty to kind of sum up right we've got I really love this idea that you kind of had of space right so where do I want to create space based on what kind of shot", "start": 484.68, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "I want to hit so you know if if a player watching this video uh struggles hitting big wipe slices well they might need to feel that", "start": 493.919, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "they start to create more space in this region of the golf swing y for these hands and arms to work into Absol and then vice versa if we get a we get", "start": 503.759, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "the old Olay snap hook player well we may need to feel that this sacrum sternum Arrangement starts to work more in harmony with the rest of the club so", "start": 512.039, "duration": 18.401000000000003}
{"chunk": "we can get on that left word path absolutely cool yeah great right on good bit that was fun yeah uh as usual um put", "start": 521.76, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
