{"chunk": "and we're gonna do a little putting video today I know we've got a lot of requests for that so Tyler is one of the best Putters I know and I'm having a", "start": 26.48, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "struggle bus right now with putting so I'm really excited to do this lesson with him um TP what you got bro yeah I'm super", "start": 34.5, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "excited to be here putting's obviously one of the biggest parts of the game so super stoked to help TJ out help you", "start": 42.18, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "guys out and show you guys a thing or two yeah yeah so you want to start with like setup let's just start there what kind of things are you looking for in setup", "start": 50.16, "duration": 17.578}
{"chunk": "um so first thing that I'd be looking for is kind of how you're gripping it okay and um how the grip is going to tell kind of", "start": 59.399, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "the path of the Putter and the release of the putter um so kind of two different things with grip we can go with a a grip that's more through the lifelines or a grip that's a", "start": 67.68, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "little bit more through the fingers each grip will will Aid in a stroke that has more of a curved path or more of a straight path gotcha so which one has", "start": 76.439, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "the more straight path uh more straight is going to be more towards the lifelines more in the palms of the hands okay you can still Arc it slightly through there but that would lead more", "start": 85.86, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "towards a straighter path and the Palms there so for those of you who don't know what the lifeline is right how would you teach somebody that to kind of grip the", "start": 94.86, "duration": 15.538999999999998}
{"chunk": "putter in their Lifeline yeah totally so what I would like them to do is just put the putter out in front of them like this kind of point it straight at your belly button like so okay and", "start": 102.479, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "then what you're going to do is allow the putter head to fall and kind of droop in your hands so you can kind of feel some tension in the top of your", "start": 111.36, "duration": 19.081}
{"chunk": "wrist there gotcha from there just post those elbows out just a little bit and allow that putter just to kind of slip up more towards kind of your thumb bones", "start": 120.42, "duration": 19.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "right here and that will put it a little bit more in the lifeline like so gotcha so I feel like it catches right there in that kind of thumb pad yeah um exactly", "start": 130.5, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "and that would tell me that I'm fully in that Lifeline right yep so how about we do this because you mentioned already there's kind of two different systems here of how you can grip the putter", "start": 139.379, "duration": 16.381}
{"chunk": "right yeah so let's why don't we go through each system so so first we'll go kind of Lifeline grip okay okay so from there if I if I know how to get it in", "start": 147.54, "duration": 15.780000000000001}
{"chunk": "the lifeline which was a good explanation there yeah what do I do from there what I like to do is put a little bit of opposing pressure on the club so", "start": 155.58, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "I'll push my fingertips into the side of the grip and as those fingertips push into the side of the grip that's also going to help me push my palm into the opposite", "start": 164.34, "duration": 18.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "side of the grip there and that's going to really stabilize the face for me so we got fingertips and then Lifeline that's kind of where", "start": 174.42, "duration": 16.738}
{"chunk": "the pressures occurring so you really do feel like a squeeze there to make sure that that putter is really in there and secure yeah okay yeah absolutely on", "start": 182.519, "duration": 15.421000000000001}
{"chunk": "pressure wise probably uh a five or six out of ten okay so nothing too crazy but but firm enough to where we can you know control the face of the Putter and not", "start": 189.959, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "allow um anything yeah that feels a lot better Rocking Around yeah so go ahead and start with one hand here okay with that pressure line up your", "start": 198.36, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "your stuff now from right here what I'd love to see you do to level out your shoulders is reach down and touch your left kneecap", "start": 207.72, "duration": 20.64}
{"chunk": "yep okay and then without elevating your shoulder here go ahead and bring your left hand right onto the putter", "start": 217.379, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "okay and then double check your forearm lines to make sure everything is nice and flush gotcha it looks about right there yep so", "start": 226.26, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "that's Lifeline now I've bounced back and forth over the last couple months because I'm just a jumble of different concepts right so let's talk fingers if", "start": 234.54, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "a player wanted to grip it in the fingers what would be some of the benefits of that well you might have a little bit more touch okay", "start": 244.56, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "um you might depend on a little bit bigger of an arc if that's what you're looking for if the putter you have is", "start": 252.42, "duration": 17.838}
{"chunk": "um you know has a lot of toe hang on it that is going to require quite a bit of Arc to actually use that tool effectively", "start": 261.419, "duration": 16.502}
{"chunk": "so you might want to go with more of a finger driven grip with that type of putter you really have to commit to what", "start": 269.54, "duration": 16.9}
{"chunk": "system you're going to use so that you kind of never get stuck in the middle when you're out there playing the last thing you want to do on the putting", "start": 277.68, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "green is be unsure about what you're doing right um so whatever system we're using we want to stick to it and and kind of own you", "start": 285.72, "duration": 17.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "know the ins and outs of that yeah so for me personally and again I'm sure a number of students will find help in this as well yeah I've always tried to", "start": 294.36, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "model my putting whether this is good or bad after tiger and in his book he's talking about how he holds it more in his fingers so that would be the system", "start": 302.46, "duration": 16.261}
{"chunk": "I want to learn and kind of fumble around with today yeah okay so you want to just kind of watch me hit a few putts with those fingers yeah let's do that", "start": 310.32, "duration": 19.7}
{"chunk": "so when I get it in the fingers like like Tyler's saying I'm not fully in the lifeline of that left hand if anything it's just sitting below the lifeline and", "start": 320.0, "duration": 19.72}
{"chunk": "the way that I kind of complete this is this left thumb or lead thumb I'm putting into the Palm or a Lifeline of", "start": 330.12, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "the right hand so now it feels instead of gripping the grip with my right Lifeline I'm gripping the thumb with my", "start": 337.979, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "right Lifeline now that's just a comfortability thing I think that's where I've putted the best in my life it's just another different kind of matchup people can play with so would", "start": 346.62, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "you say that both of your both of your hands are um matching as far as where the grip is", "start": 356.1, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "I certainly try to make make that happen if anything I have a tendency with this right hand to overly pronate it's it's", "start": 363.539, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "weird for me to feel it in this weak position but I know that when I pronate some weird stuff happens with the club so right I'm trying to match up", "start": 372.3, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "basically the backs of my hands flush together so that no hand is fighting each other during the stroke that's kind", "start": 380.46, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "of at least the image that I have gotcha so kind of first blush how does that look that looks awesome okay yeah looks really good hands look like they're", "start": 388.199, "duration": 15.780999999999999}
{"chunk": "matching okay everything looks like it's going to be pretty stable through uh throughout the stroke gotcha something that I notice here when I do have it more in the fingers my elbows definitely", "start": 396.36, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "aren't as flared as if I had it in the lifeline right and I've seen people teach this numerous different ways which is where some of the confusion lies with people I'm sure is some people say you", "start": 405.72, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "know squeeze the elbows together some people say get them out of park right would you say a finger driven one is more squeezing them together absolutely", "start": 415.199, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "yeah that would that would be more so compatible to to a grip that's in the fingers gotcha that's going to help the stroke Arc the more underneath you can", "start": 422.88, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "get those elbows will enhance that arcing motion so so something that's always helped me um is putting this alignment stick", "start": 431.52, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "underneath my elbows if I'm going to go with that type of system right um because it feels like it connects everything a little bit better so I'm going to hit a few putts like this", "start": 439.62, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "because let's see it this always lines me up relatively well when I can do this so that feels like not only not only", "start": 448.68, "duration": 16.902}
{"chunk": "fingers right and obviously there's a little bit of Arc to that but it feels like I'm rolling it more with my whole body rather than I am with the", "start": 462.18, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "hands themselves yeah um yeah what benefits do you see to that for people yeah um so kind of talking about you know two", "start": 471.0, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "different release patterns really am I releasing it with the hands or am I so more so um kind of rotating my body around a", "start": 479.88, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "fixed axis meaning the back of my head and my tailbone um that's interesting can you talk about that a little bit more for me so you're talking like this angle that you set", "start": 489.12, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "between your tailbone and your yep head yep exactly go ahead and hold that for you there go ahead and grip your putter okay yep so what I like to tell students", "start": 497.88, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "is if if this extended all the way down to the ground and kind of stuck you in the ground I put a piece of tape right here you'd almost want to feel like", "start": 505.919, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "you're rotating kind of through your lats here and just working around your head and then it really stabilizes out your arms", "start": 515.279, "duration": 18.301000000000002}
{"chunk": "your hands and everything else so a fixed axis of the spine and that way we don't have to we don't have to change what's going on", "start": 524.64, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "with our arms and our hands that club's just going to stay on a nice arcing pattern so that seems to be the most consistent way to putt in my opinion", "start": 533.339, "duration": 18.14}
{"chunk": "some people like to do kind of a passive release with their hands that also puts the club on a curve you just kind of have to decide what you're going to go", "start": 541.519, "duration": 17.561}
{"chunk": "with and you know what suits you best and what you feel more confident with fair enough yeah I like that image of kind of stabilizing the spine a bit", "start": 550.92, "duration": 16.019}
{"chunk": "um that makes me feel more rooted into the ground just that image of kind of like putting a piece of tape there right then I'm just rolling it yeah", "start": 559.019, "duration": 17.621}
{"chunk": "okay now now me personally I have a bit of a pull bias when it comes to my putts um do you see anything in there that", "start": 569.279, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "might cause that based on what I'm seeing is his release of the putter", "start": 577.68, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "is too early and too active Okay so what I'm talking about here is basically in space during the stroke where is the", "start": 584.76, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "putter head going past the hands and the grip okay so he rotates it a little bit earlier than what I'd like to see based", "start": 594.06, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "on the system that he's using so what I'm going to ask TJ is to feel like from the beginning of his through stroke that", "start": 603.42, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "he's almost going to feel like he's sweeping some dirt and allowing that putter to stay behind his hands through the strike and then", "start": 612.18, "duration": 20.2}
{"chunk": "passively release versus active actively release I do feel that I had a lot of putts with my right hand only and when I when I do pull it with the right hand I", "start": 620.94, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "feel like there yeah so it's this kind of sweeping action you're talking about right yeah yeah absolutely a lot of the great Putters through the history of the", "start": 630.48, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "game have always talked about you know getting the putter behind their hands and it really helps multiple things it helps you get a really good solid roll", "start": 639.36, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "on it you're more aware of the face and you know with that you can probably control your speed and distance a lot better too definitely", "start": 648.24, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "I'd like to hit a couple putts okay yeah I get to watch TJ head putts and I'm just dying to all right try to roll these things here tp's gonna hit some", "start": 656.64, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "putts let's do it you know let's talk about mental approach to putting okay um you know how do you how do you go", "start": 664.32, "duration": 15.299}
{"chunk": "about making more putts hitting the ball closer to the hole um being confident with what you're doing now this is a scary place for for", "start": 671.88, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "a lot of people right and it can you know you can be confident one day and have a couple bad putting holes or bad couple putting rounds and completely", "start": 680.519, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "flip the table and go into a slump and then the question is is like how do we pull ourselves out of that slump or how do we keep ourselves", "start": 690.18, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "um you know at the high point of our putting all the time you know any what do you think as far as I would love to know the answer to that", "start": 697.86, "duration": 18.541}
{"chunk": "question uh when I was playing a lot um it really was about developing a consistent putting routine yeah for me yeah I would almost talk out loud the", "start": 706.14, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "pieces of the putting routine to myself which again just takes takes away a lot of that excess noise mental chatter yep", "start": 716.88, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "you're very focused on each step of the process and what you're doing so that's what I would do yeah absolutely how about you yeah um definitely along those", "start": 724.5, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "lines you know everything is a process when it comes to when it comes to golf and actually being able to repeat what you want to do", "start": 731.94, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "and keeping that mental chatter to a really simplistic confident excited almost cocky type of mentality will help", "start": 739.82, "duration": 18.579}
{"chunk": "you actually execute The Strokes and the putts that you want to make let's just walk through one here and kind of walk through a whole mental process the first thing most people tend to do", "start": 749.76, "duration": 19.681}
{"chunk": "is look immediately at the line and abort the the thought of speed yeah I see that all the time and then fall in love with the line right that's a common", "start": 759.54, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "one yeah exactly and um you know arguably the most important part of putting is speed so we want to determine speed first speed will", "start": 767.88, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "determine the line once we're there now we just have to execute gotcha okay so I want to make a good confident decision on the speed so since we're downhill", "start": 777.42, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "here I'm going to predict a speed that's going to be more so dripping into the front edge of the hole or dropping kind of in the into the middle of the hole back of the hole is out of the question", "start": 786.54, "duration": 20.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "here so then I want to start visualizing the start point of my Putt and almost playing out little scenarios in my mind", "start": 796.079, "duration": 18.061}
{"chunk": "of if I start the putt here what's going to happen with this speed you watch some of the best Putters on tour you can tell that they're very in-depth", "start": 806.04, "duration": 18.659000000000002}
{"chunk": "um visual you can see the intensity in their eyes as they're surveying the green and what's going on yeah right exactly trying to visualize all these different scenarios so they picked the", "start": 815.579, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "one that just seems right right yep something they can commit to and then and then they fall into their process there so I'll go through a whole process", "start": 824.04, "duration": 16.438}
{"chunk": "here cool so first thing I'm going to do pick my speed I'm going to drip it into the front edge this is a pretty heavily breaking left", "start": 831.899, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "to right putt with some pretty steep slope through through the midline there of the putt so what I'm going to do is", "start": 841.26, "duration": 15.001000000000001}
{"chunk": "find my aim point which is about two feet outside the left of the cup", "start": 849.3, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "I'm gonna swing my putter back and forth until I can feel like this amount of weight this amount of energy is the", "start": 856.8, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "speed I want to use okay exhale step in and I'm going to just count one two three four", "start": 864.779, "duration": 17.86}
{"chunk": "one two three four once I find it I can set up to my putt line it up to my aim point", "start": 875.76, "duration": 21.18}
{"chunk": "one last look at the hole one two three four hmm yeah it's pretty good yeah you just have", "start": 886.98, "duration": 17.799}
{"chunk": "to put one two three four and not miss your count you missed your count on that one I miss my count yeah sometimes a camera will do that to", "start": 899.579, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "you sure but you're a little nervous yeah exactly it's like you know when someone's watching you never really know what's going on with your mind", "start": 908.04, "duration": 18.541}
{"chunk": "very good put that on your camera I'll just put that one in there I'll add it out I think what you can notice about what Tyler did there was how detailed", "start": 916.98, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "and honestly you've done that routine so many times in your life that it's just like second nature to you yep um so before this really really starts to work", "start": 925.16, "duration": 16.419}
{"chunk": "and play out for someone you've got to put in the time to actually make that second nature that's what I've noticed is like when I'm when I'm not working on", "start": 933.899, "duration": 16.982}
{"chunk": "the putting routine and I get up under pressure you don't know where your mind's gonna go but if you've developed that habit to just go through the same process every", "start": 942.42, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "single time then you've got a higher chance of making those putts under pressure yeah but yeah absolutely I think that was sick Bro I learned a lot", "start": 951.0, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "today yeah yeah me too that was fun good stuff man yeah hey guys thanks for watching that video super fun to make if you like that one", "start": 958.44, "duration": 17.279}
