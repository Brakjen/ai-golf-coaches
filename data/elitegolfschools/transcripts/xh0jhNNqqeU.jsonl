{"chunk": "things always going to have quite a bit of um extension here so the face is actually quite pretty open but the other thing we do do is we destroy the arm", "start": 1879.96, "duration": 19.879}
{"chunk": "structure compared to where I started so what I would love you to do is just sense like early in your swing if you", "start": 1889.76, "duration": 15.719999999999999}

{"chunk": "freaking awesome mhm um can you explain the difference between anterior and posterior dominant swings maybe tips on", "start": 1976.84, "duration": 16.078}
{"chunk": "getting um or anterior and posterior chain dominant swings yep um so definitely I I", "start": 1985.159, "duration": 19.721}
{"chunk": "absolutely prefer posterior chain um meaning like when we're talking posterior chain it's this load here where like all this tissue in my back is", "start": 1994.279, "duration": 21.041}
{"chunk": "is loading engaged whatever right whatever we want to call it but like this is a posterior chain look right here this is anterior chain where I just", "start": 2005.32, "duration": 17.799}

{"chunk": "player that's here boom that way and it just is like it whacks things out through the hit okay now you can stay", "start": 2065.96, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "pretty much posterior chain dominant throughout the entirety of your swing as long as we're maintaining this like", "start": 2074.72, "duration": 15.32}

{"chunk": "about oh let me let me note who it is okay Daman Damen Quinn nice what up D in the setup you talk about schaffling for", "start": 2216.96, "duration": 17.52}
