{"chunk": "um on either YouTube or Instagram or XFactor. But instead of getting like way down rabbit holes here, let let's take a", "start": 177.879, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "look at this more from uh the the standpoint of uh we'll go two big differences here. So we got wedge", "start": 187.12, "duration": 15.921000000000001}

{"chunk": "wedge, where am I going here? DD roughly. Okay, so immediately like we see this difference where it's like, okay, this ball versus that ball, which", "start": 202.36, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "is a massive difference. I mean, they're like two feet apart from one another. But first thing to take a look at is we've got like two very different", "start": 211.84, "duration": 15.079}

{"chunk": "just pump. What we're looking to do is it's it's always folks like the center of mass of your rib cage is go is what's", "start": 226.56, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "going to dictate where the low point is in general. Okay. So, easiest way to look at this is just where your sternum", "start": 236.48, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "is at P7. P7 is position seven impact. Okay? And in the golf swing, what we love to see, the preference is the rib", "start": 243.12, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "cage moves off the ball a bit. So, see how this sways off as I'm turning? I drop and as I'm dropping this will float", "start": 252.799, "duration": 17.28}

{"chunk": "mass of the rib cage is in front of uh the pelvis. Now at the strike at seven we don't see that. We'll see this actually bounce back out where the center of mass of the pelvis works", "start": 270.08, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "forward and the center of mass of the rib cage moves back. Now mo for most folks you don't need to think about the through the hit of like making sure that", "start": 280.0, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "this gets forward and this gets back. That will absolutely happen because of speed. There's numerous different reasons why this happens. Okay. So", "start": 288.72, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "without getting too far sidetracked with all that extra what we're looking for is a little off drop back in here roughly", "start": 296.479, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "at delivery. So about P5, maybe P5.5. Where is my sternum right now?", "start": 305.36, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "It's right here. So, as the club is orbiting and it's working out of my chest and out of my trunk, obviously,", "start": 313.199, "duration": 15.122}
{"chunk": "it's descending, descending, descending. Then, it's going to bottom out right underneath my sternum. And so, now I get", "start": 321.52, "duration": 15.359000000000002}
{"chunk": "this small ascend into the golf ball. Now, for driver, it depends on everybody, but if we're two, three", "start": 328.24, "duration": 17.398}
{"chunk": "degrees up on it, that's a really nice dynamic um just because we've got this concept of spin loft. Spin loft is um", "start": 340.88, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "the difference in the dynamic loft. So the loft that's exposed to the golf ball at the strike like what that loft is not the actual loft of the club at address", "start": 351.12, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "but at the strike what's the what's the loft that's presented to the golf ball as well as the angle of attack. So for driver, if I'm up on it, let's say this", "start": 359.759, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "is the angle of attack and I'm up on it 2 3\u00b0ish and I'm presenting 10\u00b0 of actual loft. We have a very small window here.", "start": 368.639, "duration": 17.682}
{"chunk": "See how acute this angle is? So I'm going to get maximum ball speed that way. For wedge, we we really want like a", "start": 377.36, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "lower ball that is higher spinning, whereas driver is a higher ball that's lower spinning. That's just in general what we want to a certain degree, right?", "start": 384.96, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "So, if I have a wedge now where I want the bottom to be in front of the ball because my AOA, my angle of attack is steeper, but the loft that's presented", "start": 394.8, "duration": 19.519}
{"chunk": "looks like this. Now, my spin loft is much different. So, I'm going to get a lower launching, higher spinning ball. The greater this angle, the more obtuse", "start": 404.72, "duration": 19.041}
{"chunk": "this angle, the higher the spin rate in the ball is. The lower that angle, the lower the spin rate is. So, we want with", "start": 414.24, "duration": 17.44}

{"chunk": "wedge, hope Tyler doesn't see that. I'm throwing his clubs all over the place. Don't tell him. Okay. And with where with wedge, I still am going to have the", "start": 431.24, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "golf club more underneath my my uh center mass of my ribs roughly. So, I'll be right in here. Okay. So, the my my sternum's hanging here. There's where", "start": 439.44, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "the golf club is. So, the golf ball is actually slightly forward of of uh the center of mass of my ribs at the address position. And the reason for that is", "start": 448.88, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "because as I'm dropping, I'm going to drop and move the rib cage forward here. Now, you'll see how my head like especially with wedges, it gets almost", "start": 456.88, "duration": 17.278}
{"chunk": "forward of where I started slightly and it'll stay in there as I turn. You'll see this look out of a lot of players on tour where the where the rib cage", "start": 465.039, "duration": 16.642000000000003}
{"chunk": "actually goes in front of the the pelvis and stays slightly in front, especially when compared to driver. When compared", "start": 473.52, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "to driver, you will always see the rib cage further ahead of the pelvis because we're not throwing as much energy in it. We want to stay dropped in more. It's", "start": 481.28, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "more turning with the chest here. So that now when my sternum is in here at at P7 or impact, I'm going to go descend", "start": 489.84, "duration": 16.399}

{"chunk": "it go down. You hit up on it to make it go up. It's like easy physics. Physics. It's just physics. Exactly. Okay. So, a", "start": 516.64, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "lot of this is based on two things. the the setup position and where the golf ball is relative to your rib cage based on the shape of the of the club and what", "start": 525.6, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "you're looking to do into the ball. Number one. And then number two, it's the amount of energy that you're going to have in your rib cage and really just", "start": 534.72, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "realistically in the entire swing. If I have more energy in this, this is going to extend earlier. So it it doesn't allow the rib cage to move as far", "start": 542.0, "duration": 17.959}
