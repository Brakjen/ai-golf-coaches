{"chunk": "let's show an over pattern so in essence what you're going to do let's put the right ore in the water and what TJ just did he did that based on on spine bins", "start": 80.64, "duration": 20.039}
{"chunk": "so in his thoracic spine excellent all that TJ did is bent exactly and you'll probably feel this in", "start": 90.78, "duration": 15.18}

{"chunk": "I'm feeling that I'm just bouncing this back so you'll see boom this fights me to get into extension which eventually", "start": 382.979, "duration": 16.380000000000003}
{"chunk": "we do go into extension because as I get this into the into the water push the water push the water keep driving to push the water forward so that makes", "start": 390.479, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "this right hip socket yeah go into extension yeah So eventually you can't help it especially at higher swing speeds like the more energy that you put", "start": 399.479, "duration": 17.101}
{"chunk": "into it you're eventually going to go into extension but through this little area this was really interesting you said since the inclination is to just do this for making the shape you almost", "start": 408.539, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "like just stretch against that inclination right exactly back chain back back that's where you see the bounce yep exactly so you're bouncing", "start": 417.419, "duration": 15.961}

{"chunk": "deep deep right yeah okay and we're showing this we've done a lot of this so like you can see us kind of play with it a little bit you'll start to earn that", "start": 434.06, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "right as you do this more and more but this is the starting point we don't start with ropes because ropes force you to get into Dynamics okay like I can't", "start": 442.199, "duration": 16.801000000000002}

{"chunk": "the club is working in space especially in this like transition phase and then how it gets into the strike just helps tremendously for sure so go ahead and just start swinging the rope and then", "start": 492.78, "duration": 17.88}

{"chunk": "under the plane over the plane to the ball that's not golf swing no right so what's really important like as as as", "start": 548.94, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "guys get going here too it's fine to let the arms like shoot some energy into the Rope see how the arms are doing it I'm not doing anything", "start": 557.339, "duration": 15.960999999999999}

{"chunk": "putting energy in the Rope once I throw it out here I'm going to catch it with the ribs so I can go one toss and then", "start": 609.06, "duration": 16.380000000000003}

{"chunk": "lots of energy chill it chill it dynamic dynamic push the pelvis back back on the ribs so this", "start": 632.64, "duration": 19.558}
{"chunk": "would be a cheat yeah on the arms doing that with your arms yeah ribs ribs ribs ribs okay okay", "start": 642.839, "duration": 16.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "and it helps tremendously with what we like to see too like go ahead and start swinging the Rope again teach we talk about", "start": 651.06, "duration": 17.82}

{"chunk": "energy into the system see how chilled it gets whoosh the whoosh is a little bit of rib fire", "start": 667.98, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "so I'm pushing water there you go so the chill is the time to get the ore in the water then the woo the energy burst is moving", "start": 676.019, "duration": 18.541}
{"chunk": "the water so when the ore is out of the water into the water that's your chill time and then you shoot", "start": 686.279, "duration": 16.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "boom boom there it is so now do the same system keep pushing the pelvis back throw show us more energy", "start": 693.079, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "like bust one and it's not in the arms it's all on the ribs on the ribs more energy come on humming", "start": 701.64, "duration": 15.137999999999998}
{"chunk": "that's cool now chill it out there you go so now you're actually learning to play with energy which is what you need to be able to do as a", "start": 710.76, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "golfer got it if you're a high level golfer and you've got 140 into a green into the wind you need to be able to pitch a seven iron in there so that you", "start": 719.459, "duration": 16.802}
{"chunk": "lower trads you lower Spin and control the golf ball super low energy super low energy if it's downwind you can freaking if you're big strong dude you're ripping", "start": 727.62, "duration": 17.1}

{"chunk": "a tightrope okay if they're going slow pedals it's going to be it wobbles nightmare to get all the time exactly so speed helps angular Force stay on plane", "start": 754.98, "duration": 20.34}
{"chunk": "got it so if it's so much easier to like it just it's like a cheat okay hitting it with speed shoots the energy out that's where the golf ball is cool", "start": 765.24, "duration": 17.218}
{"chunk": "doing one at this pace you better be able to control where the instrument is in space okay I understand speed's a cheat code yep okay fair", "start": 773.639, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "enough but you don't hit wedges like that like no and I think that's kind of why in some instances a lot of players", "start": 783.779, "duration": 16.041}
{"chunk": "will go to the range and they prefer unconsciously to hit six iron to driver rather than wedges because they had", "start": 790.98, "duration": 16.539}

{"chunk": "the system so it shoots the energy out high ball super high traged low spin feels gross nobody likes to do things they aren't good at right that's exactly", "start": 807.66, "duration": 17.82}

{"chunk": "to talk about it there was tons of comments on the last one I put out dragon rolls dragon rolls yeah okay um they asked me to explain what the", "start": 865.2, "duration": 15.601}
{"chunk": "heck was going on there and I honestly have don't know okay perfect okay yep so let's do it actually teach because it's it's great for sacrum okay so face the", "start": 872.88, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "screen tailbone is this bone right here okay spot spine spine spine l-spine sacrum's like the", "start": 882.24, "duration": 15.54}

{"chunk": "up because it's a difficult exercise what it does too is it maintains like back chain dominance is this is the ribs", "start": 923.16, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "always being in front of the pelvis okay and it's difficult to see this sometimes because we're rotating in", "start": 930.24, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "space so right now freeze TJ's Ribs are in front of the pelvis meaning he is rotated towards the screen", "start": 938.1, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "so his rib should be this side of his pelvis hip flexion keeps his pelvis back towards the towards the camera so now", "start": 947.579, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "all of a sudden that showcases sacred move back chain dominance because the ribs are in front of the pelvis right here that's awesome okay most of the", "start": 955.38, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "time when we're looking at back chain dominance we're just talking about setup well this would not be back chain dominance through the strike see the pelvis raced", "start": 964.019, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "out the ribs are falling back try to do a drag and roll that way well that ain't going to work well let's see let's see if you can do it it ain't doesn't work", "start": 972.959, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "it doesn't work at all so it teaches maintenance of back chain during motion", "start": 980.639, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "which is great so if I'm doing a Dragon Roll and going to toss it over see how the ribs are still forward of the pelvis yeah now it doesn't teach a", "start": 989.04, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "whole lot of bends we throw a little Bend IN and I look like a golfer okay but as far as back chain dominance sacrum move lateral rib Mobility rib", "start": 997.38, "duration": 20.281}
{"chunk": "sway yeah it teaches all of that it's just missing a little bit a bit okay so let's kind of explain how to do how to", "start": 1006.68, "duration": 15.06}
{"chunk": "do uh um dragon rolls right so we're starting narrow columns again same uh same uh Global pieces here throw the", "start": 1014.06, "duration": 17.819}
{"chunk": "rope over here to this side so you just throw it over to your Trailside look at that beautiful back chain that's the awesome ribs are this side the sacrum", "start": 1023.6, "duration": 15.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "already moved this way which is great now what TJ is going to do just show drag it under you and then toss it over your head", "start": 1031.4, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "that's the start okay okay so do that again just to start this so just to start this we're there drag it and throw it over", "start": 1039.679, "duration": 19.26}
{"chunk": "just like a jump rope excellent now all that's going to happen to get it back over here to the start go back to the original position", "start": 1048.62, "duration": 18.421}
{"chunk": "so once once he throws it over he's going to turn so drag over turn there", "start": 1057.26, "duration": 15.059000000000001}
{"chunk": "you go so now the Rope falls behind him and then you can throw it back over again and now guess what you're back to the original starting position so if you just do that in in pieces", "start": 1065.84, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "where we go drag over as it's going over you're going over here okay back to the original starting position there you go so all that's missing is", "start": 1075.559, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "you tossing the Rope back over got it so let's just show one drag and roll under over turn over okay", "start": 1084.74, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "under over turn back over there you go and now you're back to the original starting position so all you have to do is just continue to go back through that", "start": 1092.12, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "again and now we're swinging because it's trippy like watching it you're like how's that happening it looks like a magic trip it does yeah oh now that's", "start": 1101.66, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "really testy can you go the other way with it wait what so you started right side so this would be like a left because you", "start": 1113.36, "duration": 15.62}
{"chunk": "start left side no I think I just no that was good that was good that was it sir under over over", "start": 1120.5, "duration": 18.041}
