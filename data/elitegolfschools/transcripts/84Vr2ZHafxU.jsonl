{"chunk": "is a lower amount of energy in the whole system with a wedge", "start": 537.66, "duration": 15.78}

{"chunk": "entirety of the swing like for busting a driver Center our mass of the ribs not my general body the center of mass of your general body will stay like", "start": 1158.299, "duration": 16.701}
{"chunk": "super tight Center mass of your body's like right in your navel area got it Center mass of your ribs can go up can move a lot back in a way now it can drop", "start": 1166.36, "duration": 19.84}

{"chunk": "the way to P6 so that's the shaft getting back to the level of the ground so you're in delivery at delivery in our", "start": 1203.96, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "mind is where the lead arm gets back level okay okay and now from here this is starting to go up back and Away how much is the golf club releasing", "start": 1211.76, "duration": 15.42}
{"chunk": "not much right now not much yeah yeah right so you'll feel it release start to go now and out fully in this general", "start": 1219.08, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "area got it so you won't feel the release back here okay so this is the interesting thing too so if I'm up here to the top and my idea of the catapult", "start": 1228.14, "duration": 20.88}
{"chunk": "hmm Yep looks horrible right non-athletic yeah because this is I mean how many times have you wrote a magazine that's", "start": 1238.52, "duration": 17.401}

{"chunk": "match-up yeah really early release right because I have to get the shaft organized okay my angle attack is going to be down", "start": 1256.22, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "because my bottom out's up here yeah right so I'm just trying like if I if I held on to the angle it would make no sense", "start": 1264.98, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "not at all I gotta get it out as I'm doing that sure so now if I'm dropped in here I know this goes up back and away oh yeah this looks way more athletic", "start": 1272.78, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "yeah like if I'm chopping down a tree I'm going I'm not going into the tree that makes no sense so all the way up to like", "start": 1281.9, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "almost like P5 P6 like wedge and Driver look extremely similar you'll see differences for sure because of the amount of energy in the chest is going", "start": 1290.78, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "to start pulling on the on the hips and the pelvis but that's the main difference is the amount of energy in the chest it's the only difference okay in our system it's the only difference", "start": 1299.539, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "now other things that you can add like our foot and leg video yeah it just helps to like go okay I I can let my", "start": 1307.88, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "feet and my legs work in this way sure like like you were just saying like instead of this push Bank action like this up back and Away would lead itself", "start": 1315.86, "duration": 19.199}

{"chunk": "the swing thought today and freaking flushed it right great but just general big looks as far as the difference", "start": 1334.039, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "between wedge and Driver that's why you see the differences in certain positions because of the Dynamics of how your", "start": 1341.12, "duration": 21.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "body's moving but it's not like I think the general theme of this video is you don't have I have my driver swing and I", "start": 1351.2, "duration": 16.019}
{"chunk": "have my website yeah really it's I have my wedge energy and I have my driver energy I see and that's it and so everything else just is like a sub cat", "start": 1359.78, "duration": 21.301}
{"chunk": "of that lean and shaft attack angle all of those things right so it's not something you have to artificially create through making the different", "start": 1369.38, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "positions happen right it's just different levels of energy 100 so let's see a let's see a driver here okay", "start": 1380.12, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "okay okay where you're feeling like you're getting almost in the same positions at delivery sure in your mind like you're", "start": 1388.28, "duration": 16.019000000000002}
{"chunk": "arriving at delivery in the same way but now it's like okay up back and Away beautiful the other thing that's really cool go back into delivery again for us teach so instead of just thinking about", "start": 1396.38, "duration": 17.220999999999997}
{"chunk": "the sternum or the center of mass of the ribs a lot of times guys looking at this lead shoulder and where it's moving okay it won't exactly do this but this", "start": 1405.02, "duration": 17.220000000000002}
{"chunk": "is a good picture I want this to go perpendicular to the Target at first and then go away from the target immediately after", "start": 1413.6, "duration": 16.679}

{"chunk": "feel like your ribs went that way yep yep because that's going uh-huh there so that's a pretty good focal point for people is that leech", "start": 1429.32, "duration": 17.159999999999997}

{"chunk": "the show perpendicular in a way and as soon as it starts to really go you'll feel I can send the club head out got it okay cool yep so I want to feel a little", "start": 1446.179, "duration": 18.842000000000002}

{"chunk": "yeah that's awesome very cool and you'll see like big extension there appropriate extension extension is a good thing at the right", "start": 1463.24, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "time you need it and I think that's one thing that some people get in this mindset of is EE early extension is really really bad yeah you're right but", "start": 1476.9, "duration": 20.700000000000003}

{"chunk": "help healthy either totally okay so let's see one more driver sure and then we'll hit a wedge just to see the differences and what I really want folks to look at is just the overall energy", "start": 1531.86, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "that it looks like TJ has in his chest in both of these swings there'll be a difference in drop for sure on each one but the overall energy in the chest", "start": 1540.74, "duration": 17.82}

{"chunk": "really low rate of energy in the chest so you can keep the angle got it totally different now I test it's like", "start": 1559.64, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "that's a wedge swing then you have your driver swing sure but the system truthfully the main difference was just the energy I put in", "start": 1571.4, "duration": 16.32}

{"chunk": "little bit different yeah it's gonna you I wanted you to drop a little bit more sure others they need the center of mass going forward more others need a little", "start": 1588.5, "duration": 15.66}
