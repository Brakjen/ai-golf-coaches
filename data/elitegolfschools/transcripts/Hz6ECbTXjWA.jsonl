{"chunk": "straight TP well that's a mystery that's a mystery there's a bunch of different ways um the big question is is how do we", "start": 14.879, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "want to move and how do we want um the club head to move okay um so I think maybe one of the most common things that we see wrong is is the club head's not", "start": 22.439, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "moving right through the strike obviously our our movement dictates that but perhaps we could start with Club head what do we want the club head doing through the Impact Zone to influence", "start": 31.56, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "what we want driver to really do well um we definitely want to hit it either on the level part of the swing or perhaps on the upswing couple degrees so one of", "start": 40.12, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "the most common mistakes we might see is is a little bit too much of a descending blow right so driver kind of approaching this way I see this all the time like", "start": 49.28, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "people will unconsciously start to open the face here to add some Loft and there's your Big Slice that we see from everyone that hits driver when they're first trying to play this game right", "start": 57.84, "duration": 18.441}
{"chunk": "right so so how do we move more towards the level angle of attack like this this probably gets into body movement a little bit right when we're talking how", "start": 66.4, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "to move the body we really want to start to dissect the sequencing of when we're moving laterally when we're rotating and when we're spiraling out so the last", "start": 75.24, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "thing we want to do is lean the shaft forward a lot at the moment of the strike cuz that hits down on it and that causes up some late extension so if we", "start": 84.72, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "can feel like we move laterally and rotate laterally get up on our lead side now our lead joints can spiral out and", "start": 93.0, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "this golf club can shoot and it's almost going to feel like the club head's flinging through the strike as our lead joints yeah are peeling out that thing", "start": 101.68, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "you said about like the lead joints peeling up in a way that's probably one thing that I see a lot of people are not doing so this idea of like spiraling up", "start": 110.6, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "out of the finish right talk about like back swing and transition a lot like the load phase um maybe we could kind of give a demonstration of what it looks like to spiral up into the finish and", "start": 118.119, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "what does it look like to spiral up into the Finish okay so go ahead and do that one more time okay so what I'm seeing here", "start": 127.479, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "right like if we talk about those spiral lines like we talk about in our Channel all the time I'm seeing this spiral line that runs from tp's lead hip up and", "start": 136.879, "duration": 15.762}
{"chunk": "across his belly and Up and Under the scap here I'm seeing that really stretch out right so you can see it in his lead shoulder it's moving on this plane", "start": 144.8, "duration": 18.72}

{"chunk": "of show us what that might look like in a golf swing yeah could be an interesting one to kind of see what the GC quad tells us here", "start": 162.84, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "yeah so launch 9.6 spin was 2400 that's perfect right right in the range launch was a little bit low so I can spiral out a little bit", "start": 172.4, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "earlier just to increase that launches smidge and hopefully get a little bit more ball speed out of it so if we want to increase that launch angle a little", "start": 184.48, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "bit right so like let's define like what would be a decent launch angle for most people to shoot for right uh decent launch angle is around 12 12 to 13 um", "start": 193.239, "duration": 17.962}
{"chunk": "depending on your speed um if you got more speed you can get away with a little bit lower launch angle um if you kind of struggle with speed you want to", "start": 202.04, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "get that ball launching in the um 13 14 range okay so let's see if we can get it up to you know 12 13 14 here so that might require a little bit more of the", "start": 211.159, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "the spiraling up right it's a little bit more of that vertical Force yep yeah and on my last one I can tell you that I feel like I didn't get forward enough to", "start": 220.0, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "allow myself to spiral up and out so I kind of had to stay on top of it and keep leaning forward probably why it came out a little bit low so we'll try", "start": 228.36, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "to sequence things a little bit better here yeah I could definitely see that launch out of a different window there yeah", "start": 237.56, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "okay so so that bumped you up to a 11\u00b0 launch angle right y uh what was the last one like 9 something 9 something so yeah definitely like that difference in", "start": 250.72, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "intention there increases your launch angle and probably for most people since they don't have a lot of speed also is going to increase their distance right so let's talk about like other than", "start": 260.199, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "spiraling what maybe a couple things that we can do at setup to maybe even promote a little bit more of that upward angle absolutely so what would you do", "start": 268.8, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "like at setup to kind of influence this so I would take to to increase some launch I would take a little bit bigger", "start": 277.72, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "step with my trail foot okay and that would employ just a little bit more natural tilt so I don't want to be tilting from my bends I'm just going to", "start": 285.84, "duration": 22.28}
{"chunk": "tilt so here would be my regular stance width now if I really wanted to send one up I'm going to take a footstep to the right notice how that tilted my", "start": 297.0, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "shoulders up a little bit more help me stay a little bit more behind it and spiral up on the golf ball on the way through there", "start": 305.8, "duration": 18.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "yes that was one there yeah that one stayed up in the air for a while I should do that every time yeah maybe huh that's interesting I haven't really uh thought about just taking a step back", "start": 317.479, "duration": 17.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "kind of influences bends like that wow look at that difference yes so the launch goes up to 13 and all of a sudden the uh the carry that's about 11 yards", "start": 326.24, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "further than your previous carry as well yep um so that little small adjustment and setup is going to help you promote even more of an upward launch angle yeah", "start": 335.6, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "and what's also crazy here I swung it one mile per hour slower and got 10 more yards yeah yeah so just", "start": 343.8, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "by kind of optimizing those launch conditions down there right yeah that's cool that's cool you want to hit a couple give sure yeah how about we try it yep I think along with that", "start": 352.52, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "descending blow I mean part of that is is of course the shaft steepening a little bit in transition like we see a very very steep shaft through here but", "start": 361.759, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "also the the path of the golf club's moving overly left for most people right with a driver so in order to kind of counteract that and it's weird for most", "start": 369.96, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "people starting out they see the ball go that way Curve Way off to the right and they go oh no I just have to swing more left and it just makes the problem worse", "start": 379.36, "duration": 16.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "and worse and worse so magnifies what I'm after here is like how can I how can I manipulate the spiral lines in ways that's going to shoot the path more out", "start": 387.36, "duration": 18.038}
{"chunk": "away from me which is going to help me do a couple of things going to help me hit more up on the golf ball and path that Golf Club more right so that I I", "start": 396.479, "duration": 15.042000000000002}
{"chunk": "don't have to deal with that slice as much and the way that I would do that is is being very very deliberate of how I move the body and transition right um so", "start": 404.44, "duration": 18.479000000000003}
{"chunk": "as I'm up here approaching the top of the back swing as you talk about kind of getting your laterals done right so St backing but back up over this lead side", "start": 413.599, "duration": 17.24}
{"chunk": "um a lot of people might be moving lateral but they might be doing it in a way where this Trail shoulder kind of crashes out into the space where the", "start": 421.96, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "golf ball is sure um and this is going to be a really really tough thing to come back from like pathing the golf club right from here is going to have to", "start": 429.479, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "be a pelvis shove in order to make that happen and then we lose all control over the face all Club face stability so what I would like to see is if we're going to", "start": 436.919, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "move up and stack up on that lead side we've got to do so in a way where it almost feels as if the back is facing the target a little bit longer and this", "start": 446.319, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "makes sure that the the rib sway or the spirals are pointing more out in this direction towards the golf ball and if I show that again you'll see what that", "start": 454.52, "duration": 15.319999999999999}
{"chunk": "actually does to the shaft okay that shaft starts to shallow and move a little bit more in this plane in this direction down behind me and", "start": 462.44, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "what that would allow me to do is as I now spiral up and out of it if I just let the golf clip go you'll see the plane that it wants to shoot so that's", "start": 470.72, "duration": 15.718}
{"chunk": "the idea that I kind of want to employ here maybe add a little bit of shapes to this one ripped that was kind of ripped yeah", "start": 478.639, "duration": 16.442}
