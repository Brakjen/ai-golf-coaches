{"chunk": "best way to do this is you've gone through the progressions a ton right what are the like one two or three that", "start": 419.4, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "are the most important to you like me personally and Michael you personally yes okay well impact is is", "start": 427.62, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "always really important um that's for me and that's for a lot of students as well we can get very very wrapped up in you know positioning at", "start": 435.479, "duration": 17.819}
{"chunk": "the top of the backswing that we lose what it's really supposed to feel like um at the bottom okay and let's go even more specifically for you like impact", "start": 444.419, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "can mean lots of different things sure pelvic drop ribs like what are you like you're getting ready to hit your first shot of the day sure like literally for", "start": 453.36, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "shot of the day what are the few things in Impact that you're looking to do okay so so me personally", "start": 462.18, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "um again for you personally my tendency when I get a little bit off is I'll start sliding these hips laterally okay", "start": 469.68, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "and I won't rotate the chest much into impact so I'll start getting this face flashing that way yep so if I'm going to remind myself first few shots of the day", "start": 477.0, "duration": 16.378999999999998}
{"chunk": "number one I'm going to get these hips back okay okay so weight's gonna feel like it moves into my heels okay I'm gonna exaggerate opening the chest okay", "start": 485.819, "duration": 19.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "um we've talked about this before you call it two cheek impact basically just getting everything pointing this way at Mr camera baby yes", "start": 495.78, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "and then and then finally last thing I can do those two things but I feel relatively like level to the ground here and the way that I fix that is I try to", "start": 503.639, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "get this lead arm and shaft actually high and that might actually be a personal thing for me there you go so but it's personal again right and I think for you what that does like go", "start": 512.459, "duration": 19.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "ahead and set up to a golf ball sure um and then preset that impact beautiful now when you go back a ways", "start": 521.94, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "okay and then work back into that same look there you go this lead arm high actually helps TJ shallow the golf club a bit again we don't need to go into", "start": 530.16, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "like major detail on that action what it does to the club blah blah blah but the point here the reason for talking about this and I keep saying for", "start": 538.92, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "you is what we want like Mastery of your golf swing is understanding your golf swing to the point where okay I'm going to make this act happen", "start": 547.5, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "because when I do this movement yes it allows me to to really work in through the rest of the movements that I want to have so that I get into the sensory and", "start": 556.2, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "I feel freaking great absolutely okay which is the next level but right now it's just you showing a couple of like reps on what this looks like so this is", "start": 566.22, "duration": 16.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "your very first rep of the day let's go ahead and show kind of a mock out of this impact okay", "start": 574.08, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "good now how did you hit that fat I was hoping you'd say I don't even know I mean yeah of course you're gonna know", "start": 584.64, "duration": 15.638}
{"chunk": "that you hit it fat yeah but the point is is like what is the purpose of that exercise uh to feel the move that you", "start": 594.6, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "just explained right to feel that move now before you even hit this one did you move in the way that you wanted to not exactly okay so let's improve upon okay", "start": 602.64, "duration": 18.58}
{"chunk": "okay and what was the fix like you go not exactly what did you feel in the previous movement um well in the first move", "start": 618.0, "duration": 16.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "this is where like contact can help clue you into what you did that's how at least how I see it um so I hit a fat and I know the system and how I swing it", "start": 627.24, "duration": 18.779}
{"chunk": "very well when I hit it fat it's because I'm hanging back here on my trail foot okay um so I could be rotating my chest but", "start": 636.779, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "if my pressure's moving back here that's no good for me so I need to feel how we describe it more ribs way okay to get up here so the center of mass of", "start": 645.66, "duration": 17.58}
{"chunk": "your ribs is Shifting Target side shifting Target side and that's what like you said it clued you in because you hit it heavy so the further forward your Center and mass of the ribs can get", "start": 654.54, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "now you're controlling the bottom out to a point okay so again not to get like too deep into it but the point of this first phase is", "start": 663.66, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "literally only movement and the sequence of that movement okay that's really important when I'm saying movement it can be how I'm motoring or moving the", "start": 671.64, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "instrument in space it could be an understanding of where the face is like do I want it more shut do I want it more open how am I moving my body blah blah", "start": 681.48, "duration": 16.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "blah and it doesn't need to be this huge like I'm going to do 80 things today no it can be like that at all today I'm going to make sure like I'm having a", "start": 689.7, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "difficult time like the golf club wants to pitch over the plane and I need it to go under now there's six ways to Sunday to make that happen sure and you can you", "start": 697.32, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "can plug in whatever the heck you want to help you with did I actually make that movement or not absolutely boom and", "start": 705.66, "duration": 18.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "I hit it or not like you might whiff it hmm okay for people that like really really struggle with this that they just can't get off the golf ball just bring a", "start": 714.54, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "bag of cotton balls and throw a cotton ball down because it's like you hit it and you have no idea if you towed it no no I didn't see it is salt you have no clue", "start": 723.839, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "there's no reaction there but you can just go okay did I move in the way that I wanted then slowly start introducing a golf ball another good way to go through phase one definitely okay so let's work", "start": 731.7, "duration": 20.219}
{"chunk": "our way through let's say that you had two different exercises the first one you just talked about is a is a is an impact exercise the second one let's say", "start": 741.839, "duration": 17.519999999999996}
{"chunk": "it's a backswing exercise so you're just aware of where the instrument's moving in the backswing and then now you can go through impact again okay the next phase", "start": 750.779, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "we talk about solid golf balls being earned they're earned because I'm moving well I'm in sequence well I'm flowing", "start": 759.14, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "well like I feel kind of good so you'll naturally transition from movement to ooh now I'm starting to hit good", "start": 768.12, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "shots kind of on a regular basis and you feel nice okay so let's see just a couple of golf swings where you're just kind of feeling feeling like kind of the", "start": 775.68, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "flow of your golf swing but you still have awareness of movement sure these are usually performed at like 60", "start": 784.44, "duration": 17.9}
{"chunk": "70 or 80 percent of full cap good so phase two is extremely extremely", "start": 792.42, "duration": 16.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "short-lived it's like three balls that are like flushed out two or three balls that are flushed out in a row okay okay and", "start": 802.56, "duration": 16.859}
{"chunk": "you've got to stop why do you gotta stop okay so let's let's make the analogy of like", "start": 810.959, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "seasoning your steak okay okay so if I got a steak and I'm freaking got it on the grill and I'm throwing some seasoning on it whatever the point the purpose of seasoning is to", "start": 818.459, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "do what make it taste right okay yeah it makes it taste a little bit better yeah so rather than just throwing your steak on", "start": 827.459, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "right which would be okay I just threw my balls out and I rolled my first one and just make a golf swing because I'm warming up and just hitting it", "start": 834.839, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "okay well that's just a bland steak for most folks like you're not really progressing there okay so once we've seasoned which is movement and the", "start": 842.82, "duration": 16.438}
{"chunk": "sequence of that movement I've seasoned it so whoa I feel really good my steak tastes great stop seasoning it because you can't over season if you over season", "start": 851.339, "duration": 18.240999999999996}
{"chunk": "that means that now I'm hitting these shots and I feel great very naturally I'm going to start like adding new things in to just mess with", "start": 860.399, "duration": 18.301000000000002}
{"chunk": "it because that's my version of like how to like continue to progress my golf swing yeah problem now you're going to fall off the cliff on the other side and", "start": 869.22, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "you'll start hitting it cruddy and then you're pissed and ticked and you leave your practice session like yeah not fulfilled so many people are in like", "start": 877.8, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "constant search of improvement right which is important but they need to understand how to direct it exactly and many people just don't know how to", "start": 885.18, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "direct it they they think golf swing equates to golf score yes and if I just keep digging with a golf swing finding a new thing here here here here and even", "start": 894.18, "duration": 20.399}
{"chunk": "on that note they're not wrong sure but they're not right because it's perception so like Doug worry it says", "start": 903.899, "duration": 17.282}
{"chunk": "this all the time especially to the junior academies like he'll go out to a kid and go look if you want to shoot good scores good scores", "start": 913.26, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "come from good swings and good swings come from or excuse me good scores come from good shots good shots come from", "start": 921.06, "duration": 15.059000000000001}
{"chunk": "good swings so at the end of the day what we really need to do is just focus on making good golf swings over and over again the more good golf swings I'm I make the more good shots I make blah", "start": 928.38, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "blah blah right so but the the point again here is if I keep seasoning this to the point where", "start": 937.68, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "now I get out of the system just because I'm trying stuff because kind of you get bored just hitting it freaking really good that's the thing that's the thing", "start": 945.42, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "okay so what we've done now is we're earning like we're crossing the bridge in that our definition of a good golf swing is", "start": 954.839, "duration": 18.661}
{"chunk": "control the golf ball control of the golf ball so this is where now we get to be like kind of creative with things so we've gone through phase one to like", "start": 963.959, "duration": 15.481000000000002}
{"chunk": "earn good golf swings good movement good sequence ooh that earned me good shots red light like siren goes off we need to", "start": 971.76, "duration": 16.98}

{"chunk": "hour 20 mile an hour Breeze and I've got 140 and I need to hit like a little knock down seven iron so I've got to command the golf ball I can't just hit stock shot right now", "start": 987.899, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "so let's play with this okay okay so I'm just going to call out shots sure and through the system you're just gonna you're gonna hit these shots okay so we", "start": 997.019, "duration": 17.762}
{"chunk": "got seven iron right now yeah okay show me 160 yard seven iron foreign beautiful now did you execute I think so", "start": 1006.44, "duration": 18.941}
{"chunk": "okay and you'll notice like how far do you usually hit seven iron and we're in Colorado so it's going to go a little further here probably about 190. okay so TJ just took 30 yards off but used the", "start": 1017.839, "duration": 21.24}

{"chunk": "just did that is hard speed is a cheat because as soon as you swing it with speed the golf club releases it does all", "start": 1036.74, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "the stuff the blah blah blah feels great okay cool that's not how we play golf no it's it's not okay so now you said like", "start": 1044.36, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "stocky like you're on the golf course 190. okay this is a fun one too let's see how far can you hit this ball so we're", "start": 1052.46, "duration": 18.961}
