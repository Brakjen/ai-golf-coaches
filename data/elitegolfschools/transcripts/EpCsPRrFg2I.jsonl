{"chunk": "okay yeah we talked about hinge a lot problem with hinge is you can do two different things to hinge it okay okay so you can go radial", "start": 299.759, "duration": 18.181}
{"chunk": "you go ulnar okay what does that make the golf club look like just goes up and down so now we're managing the center of mass it's just", "start": 308.82, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "going up and down here okay or I could say hinge extension flexion", "start": 317.28, "duration": 15.0}

{"chunk": "is throwing extension along with pronation okay so if you just hold this golf club up in front of you", "start": 381.9, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "show pronation of this Trail would would close the face okay extension of the trail rest would make", "start": 391.259, "duration": 15.901}
{"chunk": "the golf club go here now that's interesting because the the center of mesh just went up right yes because what we talked about before is extension and", "start": 399.06, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "flexion just makes the center Mass go side to side and RD and UD make the golf club go up and down so why did the center of mass go up", "start": 407.1, "duration": 16.619}

{"chunk": "if I go under extension there goes the golf club now there's an amount a certain amount of of radial deviation in there there's a little bit", "start": 424.08, "duration": 18.238}
{"chunk": "of a hinge sure not a ton for most players what they feel but really what that feels like is this Force but now it's moving up in front of me instead", "start": 433.139, "duration": 15.601}

{"chunk": "shutting down yes which is awesome so we're shutting the face okay got it okay you can see that because a lot of the time like see this lead wrist now bow", "start": 448.259, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "out the bow is more of a flexion State okay go back to neutral see how now we don't have this bow just", "start": 458.039, "duration": 18.722}

{"chunk": "just a little twist what's the face doing yeah it's you're exactly you're twisting the shaft in space and that face shuts and the face shuts boom done", "start": 476.759, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "there's 2.5 so there's the backswing okay okay now there's other videos on what we prefer", "start": 486.06, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "to see with like Spirals and whatnot this is just on how the hands go so what would be kind of cool is you can geek around a little bit and go what's my", "start": 493.919, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "body doing the backswing what do my hands do to really support that because again what we're looking for is a low rate of rotation in the", "start": 501.9, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "club face through the strike and that low rate of rotation is purely because of the trail risk going from extension", "start": 510.599, "duration": 15.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "to flexion the lead rest would be going from flexion to extension so it's that unload it's a low rate of rotation so if you blend this idea of what the hands do", "start": 518.039, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "you go back and watch some of our other videos on say Body Action right you can start to get an idea of what pieces go together yes to support what you're", "start": 527.459, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "trying to do exactly exactly okay so let's go just into the backswing so right here like P 2.5 or P3 so again", "start": 536.279, "duration": 16.922}
{"chunk": "just to reiterate we've got a pronation of the trail wrist okay trial hand structure an extension of the trail", "start": 544.38, "duration": 16.379}
{"chunk": "wrist now we're loaded okay so if you just kept spiraling turn turn turn up to the top nothing changes here at all you", "start": 553.08, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "didn't do anything because you got it done early just like DJ yeah okay now as you drop", "start": 561.42, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "okay and then start to bounce into right Bend there you go see where the center of mass because of that right Bend just went it's starting to go down here", "start": 568.5, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "'s the funny thing some players need to feel an active if we just keep standing on this Trail wrist", "start": 576.779, "duration": 19.561}
{"chunk": "UD so ulnar deviation looks like this okay that u d makes the center of mass of the golf club continue to go down but", "start": 586.5, "duration": 16.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "if you're in an extension state with this Trail rest if you throw UD what you're also going to leak into is supination of this Trail arm", "start": 595.38, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "so if you watch TJ here there's UD and it leaks into supination of this arm now we're good now we're getting the center of mass down here", "start": 603.42, "duration": 16.319000000000003}

{"chunk": "Bend right here in his armpit and now as he transitions he's going to go into Trail lateral Bend and see how the center and mass of the golf club goes back it's going down and back because of", "start": 635.88, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "just this trading of the bins yeah so some guys are fine right there okay others need that active UD supination to keep the center of mass", "start": 645.3, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "going down you gotta understand and identify who you are okay okay now for your pattern do you feel that or do you", "start": 654.48, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "not feel that like an active Force here depends on the shot I'm trying to hit okay and again we just put out a video on draw versus Spade if you", "start": 663.12, "duration": 17.46}

{"chunk": "as much of that as I'm just curving around so that's really interesting so if you're a guy that's trying to work on this stuff and you're starting the golf ball left and you're sick and tired of", "start": 680.16, "duration": 17.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "it guess what you can add in a little bit of active the beauty there and what you're doing what you're trying to tap in there is you're you're really starting to control", "start": 688.62, "duration": 18.06}
{"chunk": "so go back in there again just into that delivery right there good excellent what you're starting to control because we've got these forces see how this is like bowed", "start": 697.86, "duration": 19.081}
{"chunk": "out right here that's what closes the face we got the face closed we don't need to close it anymore we need to get the center of mass going down and", "start": 707.16, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "continuing to go down that's the thing that your pet you're locking into because if you're one that starts at left you start now turning and it stays", "start": 714.66, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "on top too much there's your unload and it goes left because if you look at every single like high level player boom they look this way at the strike so I'm", "start": 722.16, "duration": 20.52}
{"chunk": "dual WD yeah that's UD this is UD yeah which is a weird look right for most people they're like what is that yeah well and what we're exaggerating", "start": 731.88, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "there is we're delaying the unload when we're showing this sure right but if I'm actually showing like that's what a tour player would would roughly that looks more or less accurate yeah yeah yeah", "start": 741.3, "duration": 18.299}
{"chunk": "even guys like Fleetwood that keeps it he keeps us on here okay I still have some degree of UD it's not as much", "start": 750.18, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "so it's not like a dress would be here it'd be slightly exactly exactly exactly so a lot of that is just passive because", "start": 758.22, "duration": 17.18}
{"chunk": "the the forces that the club is is putting on the hand structure as it so that Center of mass is going down which pulls those wrist structures exactly", "start": 766.74, "duration": 17.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "there's the ud yep and then there's impact yep okay and as it washes out then it then it's it's still in a little", "start": 775.44, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "bit of a UD action there but see how it's like I got it in the ud I'm not changing it no and bouncing out of there", "start": 783.18, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "right which wouldn't really happen anyways yeah unless somebody's pulling on the shaft right that happens yeah yeah but when it left but", "start": 791.82, "duration": 16.739}
{"chunk": "yeah we're just looking to have the golf club all right I'm in the appropriate amount here now some people need to feel like it keeps going down like we're talking about with those guys that start", "start": 800.1, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "at left keep that Center Mass going down so what closes the face down then", "start": 808.98, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "because right now if I'm doing this this looks open it stays open right yeah to the Target uh chest rotation chest rotation and what what happens then too", "start": 817.2, "duration": 20.34}
{"chunk": "is we need a passive for most people it's a passive unload which means that I'm in in this goes back to the first", "start": 826.8, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "thing we talked about it's an extension as you start to rotate boom there it gets washed out and now it's going into flexion it's a trail", "start": 835.44, "duration": 15.78}
{"chunk": "wrist so that helps Square it down as well that's what yep exactly so we're not just getting there and holding on to the darn thing yeah you just don't hold it and hold it", "start": 843.3, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "and hold it now some people need again later on this curve to feel it unload some people need it earlier if you're one that needs it earlier", "start": 851.519, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "then that'll probably feel like an active unload of the extension there you go see how TJ's like actively hitting right there with the hands but if you're", "start": 861.06, "duration": 16.317999999999998}
