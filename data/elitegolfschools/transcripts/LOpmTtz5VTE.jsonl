{"chunk": "spiral and you can see like with TJ got those are good how much time he has here to load because as the golf club is", "start": 9.84, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "floating up here he can drop re-center the ribs all the things that we want to do", "start": 18.359, "duration": 16.71}
{"chunk": "[Music] here we go here we are what are we doing today", "start": 24.97, "duration": 17.491}
{"chunk": "well had a lot of questions on sequencing understanding when things should fire when they should be chill yeah all the good things so first let's", "start": 36.18, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "just Define like what sequencing is like in layman's terms it's just the order of events like this happens and then this", "start": 45.899, "duration": 15.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "happens and then and then and then we kind of stink at trying to do everything now sure yep exactly all at once uh which by", "start": 54.0, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "the way that doesn't happen in golf swing obviously there's a backswing that then leaks into transition and then leaks into through impact to finish got", "start": 62.82, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "it handy so those of you that are out there going okay I need to do all nine of these things right now it's just a bad way to go about it you're going to have a lot of difficulty with that so", "start": 69.9, "duration": 19.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "talking about sequencing there's this idea of load and unload the load of the arm line and the unload of the arm line", "start": 79.68, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "as well as the load of the Spiral line and the unload or the bouncing of spiral wines okay okay so let's just Define both of those really what the online is", "start": 89.4, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "is it starts right here in TJ sternum it goes across his booby this is all anterior so face on if I'm looking at you here okay this is anterior arm lines", "start": 99.06, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "so the shoulder complex in front runs down the arms over the Palm over the fingers and then wraps around the fingers and now we're posterior meaning", "start": 108.54, "duration": 19.261}
{"chunk": "booty view okay got it bump side so now we're going posterior arm line goes all the way across the scaps across the back back here around the fingers again and", "start": 118.14, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "guess what now our anterior and we attach right there those of you that are going okay well how do I load and how do I unload these things that's why we got", "start": 127.86, "duration": 19.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "this guy okay fascia Works in a pretty cool way in that if I pull on this rubber band okay you take one in sure", "start": 136.92, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "okay pull on it would it be loaded or unloaded loaded okay unload it there you go so it's really cool if you do that", "start": 145.8, "duration": 15.139000000000001}
{"chunk": "again weird it went in the same direction yeah so one how much energy did you put in Making the Band go this way zero zero so", "start": 153.84, "duration": 19.999}
{"chunk": "we would call that free energy yeah and it's also precise because it's not like you let it go and it went this way one time and it goes here and there and like all over the place it still goes in the", "start": 166.98, "duration": 17.459999999999997}
{"chunk": "same direction so you get free speed and precision if you know how to sequence the spirals", "start": 175.68, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "and the arm lines got it okay okay so here we got preferred patterns go ahead and hold on to that guy I don't sure trade yep throw that thing away put it", "start": 184.8, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "over there okay so let's go ahead and just set up okay there's really two main ways to motor this ball", "start": 194.879, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "there's one way which we don't prefer which is just shoving the arms back and forth so move that ball to and fro this would be armline load so if you just go", "start": 202.319, "duration": 18.662}
{"chunk": "from neutral TJ and then show me a backswing this band which is the posterior arm line just loaded in the", "start": 211.92, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "first two feet of your swing so imagine this band just getting stretched because from neutral see how this like you'll feel it too", "start": 220.2, "duration": 15.541}
{"chunk": "like those of you that are going to do these exercises which by the way do these exercises you'll hit them better from right here you'll feel how this is", "start": 228.36, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "like chilled out okay now don't move the body at all just move this lead arm across you feel how this loads you'll feel it stretch in here kind of through", "start": 235.44, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "the scap this whole lead shoulder complex posterior load yes problem which we'll get into here in just a second", "start": 243.9, "duration": 15.539}
{"chunk": "okay okay or you can motor that ball with the spiral line got it okay now we've got two different spiral lines right it's like if somebody just painted", "start": 251.28, "duration": 17.101}
{"chunk": "a blue X in front of me go underneath my armpits and then over the sketch right here got it I want you to use your Trail side meaning it goes underneath your", "start": 260.28, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "Trail armpit upper spiral line to just start moving but in your mind you're going to keep the ball right here teach so go ahead", "start": 268.86, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "and set up again and you're just going to keep it here relaxed in the arms but move this upper spiral and this will start to respond", "start": 278.1, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "good let's do that again now I'd love you to do even better is now go ahead and start moving moving that upper spiral there you go see how", "start": 286.5, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "it stays for a second and then this responds that's kind of the slo-mo look got it if you wanted to be really sexy you'd move this complex a little bit", "start": 294.3, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "laterally so in essence she was just going boom see I'm not like really turning much yet I'm just moving the center of mass of my", "start": 303.18, "duration": 16.76}
{"chunk": "ribs off the ball I.E Stenson 2000 tiger they all early load this lateral drift of the spot of", "start": 311.22, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "of the center mass of the ribs okay and then spiral second so it's like a one two so if I really want to load that up I might go", "start": 320.639, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "there you go and look at how the ball feel the ball on the arms respond to that yeah now let's just do that a little bit more dynamically so it's kind", "start": 329.94, "duration": 16.261}
{"chunk": "of boom boom it's playful um good good and if I can just use that ball for just a second a good way to just get", "start": 337.86, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "this gone again this is inefficient which we'll get into here in a second if I just start moving this laterally with no spirals yet", "start": 346.259, "duration": 17.101000000000003}
{"chunk": "boom boom boom and again slow-mo I'm going to keep this ball here then I just moved this the center mass of my ribs to my trail side boom boom see how the ball", "start": 354.24, "duration": 18.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "would respond boom boom it's not together it's not online it's Center of mass", "start": 364.68, "duration": 15.840000000000002}
{"chunk": "lateral okay okay A little separation yep so boom boom you can see like boom boom boom boom there's playroom now if I wanted to go ahead and spiral", "start": 372.12, "duration": 19.86}
{"chunk": "I'd do that second okay okay so what we're doing is we're delaying the load in in two main portions of the arm line", "start": 381.78, "duration": 16.020000000000003}
{"chunk": "for us as right-handed players your lead side posterior arm line and the scap and shoulder complex okay and", "start": 390.18, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "your anterior Trail side okay so you don't want to load those up too early we're going to load them in transition okay because if we load them here's the", "start": 398.1, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "pro improper sequencing if I load them early so right now this action is a load like again rubber band right here boom", "start": 407.639, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "that's a load early boom load early I've got them loaded in the backswing what do fascial lines that", "start": 415.139, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "are loaded want to do unloaded unload so they're gonna want to unload in the transition area or I'm just going to have to", "start": 423.24, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "artificially keep them loaded keep them loaded keep them loaded forever which is excess tension which just makes us feel gross both of those feel gross", "start": 432.18, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "so the ideal would be I'm gonna I'm gonna chill this out I'm gonna chill this out in the backswing whoa so there's backswing so the arm", "start": 439.62, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "lines aren't loaded see how this is relaxed that's relaxed super chill yeah if I put enough energy in the spiral and the arms do fire they're going to fire up here but in our in our definition", "start": 449.4, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "this is the finish of the backswing this is the start of the transition we want to load and load throughout", "start": 458.22, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "transition got it load got it now I'm loaded okay what are what are arm lines that are loaded want to do unload unload", "start": 466.38, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "so now I've got the unload in this face precise snap of a band happening through impact precise being the operative term", "start": 475.44, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "it's Precision because it's going to unload in the same way and it's free speed free speed so if you have a fashion line that's loaded it's wanting", "start": 485.06, "duration": 16.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "to snap back plus you're throwing muscle activation into that as well that's like heavy hit and that's in every single sport right if I'm a boxer I go here to", "start": 493.68, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "separate I just loaded the anterior Trail arm line boom to hit somebody same thing with pitching yep there's this separation", "start": 502.919, "duration": 17.461000000000002}
{"chunk": "right now I can turn and fire got it right like if you just got up here this is like the most unathletic looking thing ever soft right if I just tried to", "start": 511.319, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "throw a ball this way there's nothing in it as soon as you do this something in it sure now you can knock", "start": 521.339, "duration": 18.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "it got it we want the same thing just golfy okay because throwing a baseball is over Center of mass of my body hitting a golf ball is under the", "start": 529.74, "duration": 15.899000000000001}
{"chunk": "center of mass my body goes under okay okay so if we do this let's do it with uh let's do it with the ball again okay so we'll just we'll just show the", "start": 538.019, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "sequencing and I'll explain the sequencing of the load phase okay the load phase is from P1 P5 which we call delivery got it okay so", "start": 546.779, "duration": 19.261000000000003}
{"chunk": "let's just show backswing sort of P 2.5 no load no load there you go so you can see even here", "start": 556.08, "duration": 15.456999999999999}
{"chunk": "like a little bit more turn TJ is damn near fully rotated in his chest and in his Spirals and the arms are still down now", "start": 565.019, "duration": 18.540999999999997}
{"chunk": "if there were energy in that okay go back there if there were energy in that the arms would continue to go up as he drops and", "start": 574.5, "duration": 16.980999999999998}
{"chunk": "re-centers now loaded loaded got it great okay let's do that again so we're just going", "start": 583.38, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "to go to backswing so again no load no load now go all the way through transition to P5", "start": 592.44, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "good and even holding on to you right there I can feel this load there's the load phase so the arm lines begin to get loaded and finish their", "start": 601.32, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "load at the end of transition got it we're at the beginning of transition they start their load at the end of transition they're fully loaded but from", "start": 610.38, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "P2 to 2.5 here there's really no load happening yet yeah from P1 to P 2.5 yeah absolutely there's no load and as a", "start": 618.12, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "matter of fact like a good picture for a lot of players right now this arm line I can actually almost anti-load a bit in", "start": 626.64, "duration": 19.939}
{"chunk": "that it's getting slacked out even more so at the start my midline is right over my hands our preferred pattern is to see the", "start": 636.66, "duration": 20.561}
{"chunk": "midline outrace The Hub or the hands at the start I see so this is actually more slacked out because it would be going this way", "start": 646.26, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "relative to my midline meaning a b duction so that's where like that Henrik Stenson look you were talking about right he'll go this way there again", "start": 655.74, "duration": 17.94}
{"chunk": "there he goes over here it goes that way hands are here now keep turning see how that's out racing oh I see it yep yep there we go now as you bounce", "start": 664.98, "duration": 21.54}
{"chunk": "these up and and you load these now into P5 now we're loaded see how this now this structure got behind the midline because", "start": 675.24, "duration": 16.358}
{"chunk": "it's pointing over here got it so it starts in front or I should say starts in line yep moves in front", "start": 686.82, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "now it's going to move boom there you go exactly and now you can hit the hit is the", "start": 694.44, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "firing of the lead side upper spiral I mean it's going underneath my lead armpit so there's the hit boom and we can hit with the arms so I've got them", "start": 702.06, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "like in in delivery whoop this lead arm if we just look at this that's a deducted abduction now if the lead Spiral goes and I go into a b there's a", "start": 710.94, "duration": 18.298000000000002}
{"chunk": "good solid hit and the trail arm is in a b duction going into a deduction so there's a good hit and that's a cool feel you can kind", "start": 721.079, "duration": 15.661999999999999}
{"chunk": "of feel that rubber band right there yep exactly it just goes yeah everything just goes you've loaded up the system and then wants to wash that energy out", "start": 728.82, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "so you're washing it out and hitting at one time that's like the best feeling ever it just feels right when people go man my golf swing feels really good", "start": 736.98, "duration": 18.659}
{"chunk": "usually what they're talking about one is they're managing the head area really well so what they've done in in into delivery has just organized them so that", "start": 746.519, "duration": 16.021}
{"chunk": "now it's very easy to operate in the space okay but you're also feeling sequencing got it sequencing is like the", "start": 754.62, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "the door that we're opening to rhythm rhythm is like manifested because of how you sequence movement I see it yeah and", "start": 762.54, "duration": 21.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "fascial lines muscle fire it all moves in wave like fashion that's a loop brachiism that moves in waves they're", "start": 772.86, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "not lightning bolts it's not boom it's you think of just like how a wave moves we've got this build so it's climbing", "start": 781.38, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "got it and it crests and then it washes out so let's do this with a medicine ball first okay I'll just stand right over", "start": 789.959, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "here you go right there and we'll do these like a little gentle you'll just toss it to me gently okay yep but what I want to see this is just a good way to", "start": 798.3, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "kind of drill this out if we've got two points the center of mass of the ribs which is pretty much like just think of where the sternum is that'll help you and the ball the middle", "start": 806.22, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "of the ball this dude is trying to get away from that dude almost at all times now that doesn't necessarily happen because", "start": 815.339, "duration": 15.779999999999998}
{"chunk": "there's there's times that they're going in the same direction but right now if you just start moving this laterally so no rotation really see how it's it's", "start": 823.079, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "this distance has got gotten bigger it's elongated now if you start to spiral a bit to turn it over there as soon as this starts to go that direction this", "start": 832.079, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "guy is like nope and it comes in every centers yep there good thank you", "start": 840.779, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "good so keep doing that yep exactly boom boom excellent I'll toss one okay okay so again this is trying to separate away", "start": 847.92, "duration": 19.86}
{"chunk": "from the ball so even these like little we can just call these like little walkouts like we're here boom as soon as the ball starts going in the same", "start": 858.24, "duration": 16.26}
{"chunk": "direction as the sternum or the center of mass of the ribs the ribs go the opposite direction okay so I'm here oh now they're all going together nope I'm", "start": 866.7, "duration": 17.698999999999998}
{"chunk": "going here now it's going together nope I'm going here boom boom boom great ribbon drill so now if I toss this at it", "start": 875.339, "duration": 17.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "here here just to like load up and move that and motor that in the proper way sure our", "start": 883.62, "duration": 16.139}
{"chunk": "preferred way got it because that like just eye testing it which one looks better this or this", "start": 891.779, "duration": 16.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "definitely gonna go with option A okay just to eye test Athletics right you're like I like that one more than that one even if that one doesn't look that that", "start": 900.48, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "bad it's like I like that one that's got that good stuff it's kind of like athlete it's got like athlete yeah exactly so just show the walkout so there's no spirals here we're just going", "start": 908.1, "duration": 17.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "like you'll feel like your center of mass of your ribs is just on a clothesline so there's not a whole lot that's so beautiful", "start": 916.38, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "athlete okay so now let's go ahead and drill this with a golf ball go ahead and set up to that golf ball okay and what I want you to do TJ is", "start": 924.66, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "we're just going to hover the club so it's above the ball okay okay now again the stick is only going to move because this starts going laterally and this all", "start": 932.82, "duration": 18.741}
{"chunk": "responds to this okay boom there you go just keep waving it waving it and whenever you want you can", "start": 941.88, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "go ahead and spiral load it to the top and hit it meant interesting too how like this see how calm this is up here", "start": 949.56, "duration": 18.017}
{"chunk": "so we see all these really good players that this area looks like it's calm okay now not everybody on tour looks like", "start": 961.019, "duration": 15.181999999999999}
{"chunk": "that but yeah a lot of our favorites look like that like the golf club has time to just like cruise up here and float and then it goes the reason that", "start": 968.04, "duration": 20.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "that's happening is from right here at P 2.5 I have anterior Trail and posterior lead arm lines unloaded", "start": 978.18, "duration": 19.619}
{"chunk": "so now I need time to load them so now as the arms bounce up they're starting to load as I drop and go the other way I finish the load got it well", "start": 987.899, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "I see it well it floats in here sure now if I loaded the lead arm line early set wants to bounce off", "start": 998.279, "duration": 18.122}
{"chunk": "ain't no chance to float we do that so what's cool is that like you can even test this at home too if you just fire this across this lead arm line and try", "start": 1007.1, "duration": 15.539}
{"chunk": "to keep it up here you won't be able to see it bounce um because that's the rubber band right it's rubber band", "start": 1015.38, "duration": 15.598999999999998}
{"chunk": "yeah with that and just try to keep it there just as best you can just try to keep it up there see it bounce it just can't help it yeah okay so there's no flow", "start": 1022.759, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "whoa there you go so now if you're going here hello okay as I'm going here so I could float it up here to the top", "start": 1031.699, "duration": 16.022}
{"chunk": "yep so that's lateral then spiral then arms is what's happening lateral spiral wound", "start": 1040.16, "duration": 15.658999999999999}
{"chunk": "there go the arm second just I can place it here so there's the sequencing for faults that's the sequence lateral spiral arms yep and a lot of players", "start": 1048.02, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "that we coach we talk about feeling like you can place it here as you're dropping and moving and and dropping back in here oh", "start": 1055.76, "duration": 17.941}
{"chunk": "boom so now you're dropped back in now you've loaded these in our preferred pattern now hit it with everything wash", "start": 1064.64, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "it out okay let's throw that that drill again just feeling like this is what's leading the club's responding both ways like", "start": 1073.22, "duration": 18.62}
{"chunk": "this is trying to get away from this boom boom whatever you want to spiral and you can see like with TJ God that was so good", "start": 1081.5, "duration": 17.139}
{"chunk": "how much time he has here to load because as the golf club is floating up here he can drop re-center the ribs all the things that", "start": 1092.179, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "we want to do in that space you have time to do it and now you'll feel at you'll feel passively passive load here", "start": 1101.6, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "meaning you're not actively trying to move anything you're not actively trying to load the arm like this is an active arm load because I'm actively moving my", "start": 1109.58, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "arm compared to my arms here if I just dropped and turned that's a passive arm load okay so I think that's a pretty good place to just kind of stop and like", "start": 1118.76, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "have everybody chew on that but it's really again if you can think of I want good rhythm where good Rhythm comes from is proper", "start": 1128.12, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "sequencing gotta understand the sequence yeah exactly in the sequence just in the simplest terms is how does the spiral", "start": 1137.24, "duration": 16.5}
