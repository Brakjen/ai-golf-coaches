{"chunk": "so here we go um all right so second video second video what are we talking about Club face control Club face control you hear", "start": 10.8, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "about that a lot a lot yes it sounds sexy it sounds sexy um yeah I just think it's something that", "start": 18.84, "duration": 15.299}
{"chunk": "a lot of people don't do very well um control the club face so I want to understand how to do it today um maybe some practical drills in order", "start": 26.34, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "to understand it and yeah get right into it absolutely I think that sounds great so Club face control is like one of those", "start": 35.52, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "big things again in my opinion that's um uh you hear a lot about it but it's like you just they get cast out there like you need to control the face better so", "start": 43.5, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "like in essence we throw out this problem and then there's no solution really uh the other thing we hear often is like every single person that we work", "start": 52.68, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "with is like dude you know if I just was a little bit more consistent yes then I'd be so much better basically everyone you're asking what their goals are I", "start": 60.96, "duration": 15.121}
{"chunk": "want to be more consistent exactly well and what consistency really is is obviously hitting it out of the middle of the face but where that face is pointed through the strike is going to", "start": 68.4, "duration": 18.299}
{"chunk": "dictate overall dispersion correct right so if we've got a higher rate of rotation in the club face through the strike", "start": 77.28, "duration": 16.141}
{"chunk": "the chances of the golf ball going further left or further right just Elevate right right so like our favorite Strikers uh I would throw like Victor", "start": 85.68, "duration": 21.36}
{"chunk": "hoblin in there yep obviously Hogan um and there's a number of guys on tour that you just see like through the impact area as it exits through the ribs", "start": 95.52, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "that the face is just not rolling over any longer right um and I think that's really important for people just to gen generally", "start": 104.64, "duration": 15.540000000000001}
{"chunk": "understand so that when they go to the range and they're working on their technique that those things actually mean something you're not just like guessing through the strike again that's where", "start": 112.32, "duration": 16.499}
{"chunk": "the frustration comes from is like I'll hit one and I guess okay and it kind of goes forward and then the next one is like feels the same but because the rate", "start": 120.299, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "of rotation is so crazy it's like some totally different result and then I'm tick off yeah when you've got snap hook and push fade in your bag that's not", "start": 128.58, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "necessarily a good combo and straight and high and low just about every combination exactly exactly so let's get into this so um teach why don't you go ahead and set", "start": 138.06, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "up to this golf ball for us and actually before we do that let's face the camera um and what I want you to do is just show", "start": 146.52, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "kind of what the risk can do and let's do it without a golf club first just so that we're actually like educating what all all the risks can do because they", "start": 154.92, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "can do a lot in here so this action of just hinging okay what that does is obviously leverages the golf club straight up in", "start": 162.84, "duration": 15.901}
{"chunk": "the air okay that's called Rd radial radial deviation if I went the other way that's UD ulnar deviation", "start": 170.64, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "okay so already yeah so the club's just doing that right so if I just go Rd UD like we call I call it pistol drill if I'm drawing on somebody that would be", "start": 178.92, "duration": 17.94}
{"chunk": "already put the pistol back in the holster that's UD oh cool okay got it right easy enough to remember yep but what that's doing is it's just", "start": 188.58, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "leveraging the golf club up and down on this plane you could also go with the trail risk complex so this is right-handed players that way that's", "start": 196.319, "duration": 19.020000000000003}
{"chunk": "extension okay of the rest or I could go this way that's flexion of the wrist what's that making the golf club do be very very Square yeah and it just", "start": 205.319, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "makes the club go side to side right for sure so this is up and down this is side to side okay got it the other thing that I can do is make this wrist go that way", "start": 213.959, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "that whole wrist complex is going here it's rotating that's supination okay you remember supination because you're holding a cup of soup got it exactly and", "start": 222.84, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "the other way that would be pronation that's also different this is in the forearm okay than the upper arm so if I'm doing this this is internal rotation", "start": 231.959, "duration": 19.981}
{"chunk": "external rotation okay okay so when we're talking pronation supination it's from the elbow down and then would you call this again internal versus external", "start": 241.44, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "yeah so the humerus is this bone right here okay so if I took you from relatively neutral and rotated you that way I'm rotating you internal that's", "start": 250.62, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "internal rotation or external rotation of the humerus got it and that's elbow up and that's elbow level okay got it and oftentimes this is kind of", "start": 258.78, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "interesting topic kind of off on the same topic and off arm action hand action so it's not just hand action", "start": 266.94, "duration": 15.661}
{"chunk": "it's a hand action right below the elbow there because all this makes this stuff right okay so let's just figure out what in the heck that does with a golf club", "start": 274.8, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "because we just went over like three different topics in essence so let's hold the golf club right out in front again show me left hand supination", "start": 283.56, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "would that make the golf club do shut down well what's interesting there is you did a couple of things you supinated and went into flexion oh I see yeah so", "start": 292.979, "duration": 16.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "can I do it with just supinating yep there you go so we're just going so in essence that structure doesn't change at all what you showed at first was that", "start": 300.9, "duration": 19.739}
{"chunk": "which is confusing because we have so many different ways that we can move these complexes in here oftentimes what you're doing is you're going to add", "start": 310.199, "duration": 21.72}
{"chunk": "two if not three different actions at one time this is a lot going on it's a blend of actions for sure exactly but again if we", "start": 320.639, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "just went from neutral see how there's a little a slight amount of extension right here yeah so there's a little cup right there so that's a slight amount of of lead wrist", "start": 330.539, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "extension if we kept that same amount of extension and supinated you you'd look like that that's what the", "start": 340.259, "duration": 15.061000000000002}
{"chunk": "face just do that shuts it down shuts it down so the rate of rotation is fairly High if we go this way", "start": 348.06, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "that's RDU d r d u d okay what's the face doing face isn't moving fairly stable right very stable yes okay how about this way", "start": 357.18, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "this is flexion to extension what's that face doing that's not moving much as well not moving much as well so fairly stable yes", "start": 366.12, "duration": 19.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "both of those actions are fairly stable so rdud is a stable action and flexion extension is a stable action as well", "start": 375.84, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "exactly and flattened we're talking lead wrist here because sometimes like if I go supination of the lead rest that means the trail", "start": 384.12, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "rest is pronating got it so they go together exactly if I go extension of the trail rest that means the lead wrist", "start": 392.4, "duration": 15.598999999999998}
{"chunk": "is going into flashing exactly okay yep compared to Rd both going to Rd both going to UD understood yep okay so", "start": 400.139, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "generally I think it's good to just like better understand everything that can happen from the elbows down again hand", "start": 408.6, "duration": 16.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "action so that's going to dictate a lot of what's going on with the face okay okay the really nice thing about stabilizing the face is what we do", "start": 416.819, "duration": 19.261}
{"chunk": "really early in the backswing is going to help load these different systems and all these different potentials", "start": 426.12, "duration": 15.78}
{"chunk": "and based on how you load it it's going to dictate how you unload it okay so you can kind of cheat the system a little bit and then you just load it up early", "start": 434.28, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "kind of forget about it and then just forget about the unload too because it's just going to get taken care of okay especially if your body's working really well", "start": 442.38, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "totally different topic for this particular video but if we can just load it really nicely then all of a sudden it's just like you just kind of turn and", "start": 450.36, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "let it go and it's going to unload in either more stable patterns or more unstable patterns okay totally the Player's Choice but we're here to just", "start": 457.86, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "educate like how you can go ahead and kind of use these cheat codes to help stabilize the club face right in this particular video so you're kind of saying that club face control starts out", "start": 465.96, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "like right from the get-go in the golf swing right so you can for sure okay there's some not very many like I could study this a little bit", "start": 474.66, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "more but the the one pattern that I think of for somebody that actually changes risk conditions from a like a an extension deflection", "start": 483.9, "duration": 17.099}
{"chunk": "standpoint and transitions like more Cala as it's going up he's got a little bit of flexion in this lead wrist and then it goes into more and more and more and more and more and more crazy more", "start": 493.02, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "crazy more into there yeah he does a lot of that and that's late that's late I would venture to say that that probably wasn't taught into his system that's", "start": 501.9, "duration": 19.62}
{"chunk": "just a quirk that's something really freaking cool yeah but it's just what makes more cow morikawa okay right whereas other guys", "start": 511.62, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "like you watch DJ early in his swing very early he goes super early yep yep and I'm actually curious I would love to talk to DJ about what he actually feels", "start": 520.32, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "if it's Trail rest or if it's lead wrist if he doesn't feel it at all just because that's DJ who knows but it's a really cool pattern so go ahead and get", "start": 528.6, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "into setup and also this would be good too face the camera too so you can just show folks kind of grip okay you're almost in like a dual extension", "start": 538.08, "duration": 21.6}
{"chunk": "pattern at a dress fairly mirror like right boom as you grip it so it's not like we're in flexion here no reflection", "start": 547.8, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "there no right it's just fairly I think you have a fairly neutral grip right from my standpoint pretty much and that we've got a little bit of extension in both in both wrists okay so here's how", "start": 557.22, "duration": 18.659}
{"chunk": "we're going to load that system a couple of different ways to feel this I want you to feel the trail rest take that right hand off for me", "start": 567.24, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "okay and just put it right next to the club good and now from here as you work down the shaft I want the Palm to work down the shaft and work into extension", "start": 575.16, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "that way there you go so you feel that probably in this whole band load up like this gets stretched out okay okay so go", "start": 583.08, "duration": 15.059000000000001}
{"chunk": "ahead and grip it again and show us that same feel okay great so because of this we've got", "start": 590.519, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "more extension of the trail rest and this has almost gone into a little bit of flexion and the first two feet three feet of your golf swing right so", "start": 597.66, "duration": 19.139}
{"chunk": "now we're loaded here we're loaded there these armbands posterior arm line anterior Trail Army got it okay so now", "start": 607.38, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "if you can view those do that again for us if you can view these as rubber bands you stretch those rubber bands if you", "start": 615.959, "duration": 16.141000000000002}
{"chunk": "were to let go of the rubber bands what would they do right and that's where like if I show it here to the camera yep that's pretty", "start": 624.12, "duration": 15.461}
{"chunk": "stable super stable now that looks like a flip everyone go you flipped it sure but that's just because I'm not moving my chest along I'm not moving your chest and by the way", "start": 633.06, "duration": 20.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "our terminology that's a stable release okay a flip is pronation supination so again this is", "start": 642.36, "duration": 17.901}
{"chunk": "supination holding a cup of soup to pronation to pronation so if I show that pattern here yep supination to pronation of the trail rest what the club face do", "start": 651.86, "duration": 17.619}
{"chunk": "there is the athlete like would you feel like I had no control over it just rapid rapid closing so here's the thing could you hit a straight shot that way yes I", "start": 661.019, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "would just have to make sure this is lined up at impact but again it's like a guesswork game it's got to be timed up perfectly and by the way there's guys on", "start": 669.48, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "tour that that do that yeah so it's not that it's wrong and there's another right way you can do that and hit great", "start": 676.98, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "shots like Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson holy cat the rate of rotation through the strike is like through the roof both", "start": 685.2, "duration": 17.781}
{"chunk": "exceptional players 100 yeah okay but what we're talking about is like for folks that are looking to either increase stability and have a better", "start": 693.5, "duration": 17.5}
{"chunk": "blueprint of how to like Club face stabilities is simply like lowering the rate of rotation in the club face and how to do so how to increase that how to", "start": 703.14, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "decrease that these are simple ways to do so got it okay so let's put this into action um really nice setup", "start": 712.2, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "okay and show that first like little feel where you're feeling like that Trail Palm is going down there you go excellent now super gentle here you know", "start": 721.98, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "the load now we know how it's going to unload but from right there just finish your backswing turn and unload it", "start": 730.079, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "there you go okay so let's set it set it beautiful finish the back swing turn and unload it excellent", "start": 738.12, "duration": 17.861}
{"chunk": "now you can do I mean there's there's some cool uh like hack motion super awesome it shows like all the things that the wrist can do", "start": 750.18, "duration": 17.279000000000003}
{"chunk": "um certain monitors like flight scope trackman um uh uh g-quad they can show like", "start": 759.3, "duration": 20.220000000000002}
{"chunk": "thresholds right at the moment of the strike it's not really showing like dynamically what's going on here but you can see you'll start to see like oh the", "start": 768.779, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "club face is 0.2 degrees left on that particular shot and on the next shot is 0.5 degrees right blah blah blah blah but if you hit 20 shots you'll get like", "start": 776.94, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "this great Baseline and that'll show you kind of like your Raider rotation like if you have 1.2 left and the next one's like 1.2", "start": 787.32, "duration": 15.540000000000001}
{"chunk": "right that's pretty crazy that's a big big change that's a big dispersion so if you do this and you're going through like an exercise like this you actually", "start": 794.94, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "put our words to the test and see like hey does that dispersion shrink yeah so your face stability is better okay good", "start": 802.62, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "right right okay uh what are your favorite drills I just threw out threw one out what do you got well for face stability uh you teach me", "start": 811.44, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "I just taught you give me that club there you go I mean one of my favorite ones for faceability would be kind of like a mock", "start": 821.339, "duration": 15.242}
{"chunk": "delivery position okay um so again that's that's been talked about yeah like preset but then come all the way back into a backswing and Float to", "start": 828.54, "duration": 19.859}
{"chunk": "that honey hole type position yeah so so now this club is behind your rib cage okay so one of my favorite ways to", "start": 837.779, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "stabilize it is to Simply leave it behind the rib cage and turn right if you kept the chest moving through the strike there actually kept it turning", "start": 847.56, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "that face is not going to flip over on you so hopefully folks can see what the face looks like there right as I keep turning we can see how that face is", "start": 856.079, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "gradually it's almost like what I see it as is if the club face had headlights on it and this is like the path is a road yeah I'm more or less just turning to", "start": 864.959, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "keep the headlights facing the road yeah and that's all you're doing there right you're not really feeling anything in the arms wrist right so compared to if I", "start": 874.62, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "went back to that same position that honey hole or P5 and then this stalled yes right the arms would keep going I just spun my car out right exactly", "start": 882.48, "duration": 18.418999999999997}
{"chunk": "that's where you're going to get that supination of pronation look is if the chest stops moving right so that that flexion to extension pattern pairs", "start": 891.779, "duration": 18.421}
{"chunk": "really well with the chest rotation okay right so uh one drill I would have you do is if you want to just go ahead and find that little delivery ask position", "start": 900.42, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "right okay go ahead and pick the club out up out in front of you okay and just simply set it on your right side of your body so we would almost go Rd", "start": 908.88, "duration": 21.178}
{"chunk": "to flexion yep and one kind of gradual whoop yeah right and and if I look at the camera here it's just Club faces on the right side of my body right hands", "start": 918.959, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "are still out in front of me okay yep now from that position if you go and find that position for me so if I'm going wrong yep okay now you would more", "start": 928.98, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "or less turn your chest on a flat plane so this is not necessarily golf swinging some level your level yeah so you're just going to turn it I want to actually", "start": 937.62, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "have you turn it around this way I see so now now you can go ahead and find the golf ball through Bend and rotation okay", "start": 945.54, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "great I love that okay so I'm feeling that there's a little drop here a little drop which kind of helps some systems definitely mine yep and then from here", "start": 955.019, "duration": 19.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "I'm feeling obviously this is turn this is Bend so I'm just kind of blending those together so if I drop and feel that I'm going there absolutely okay", "start": 964.5, "duration": 17.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "great all the while leaving that club on the right side of your body so I'm up here and then feeling that like that's it to get in there okay so if I", "start": 973.26, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "just hit one like that just a little chippy one so it's up yeah super super you can feel it like in your hands it's cool it just doesn't", "start": 982.139, "duration": 15.661000000000001}
{"chunk": "flip over yeah it never turns over it's just super duper stable so I think one thing that would be kind of fun for folks to do too because at the end of", "start": 989.519, "duration": 15.660999999999998}
{"chunk": "the day like how many people do you play with or coach and they're like you know I really feel like I'm a feel player sure well we all are right like if", "start": 997.44, "duration": 17.579}
{"chunk": "you're shooting a free throw you better understand like what it feels like to execute that compared to shooting a three-pointer or a seven footer it's all different right so you're feeling that", "start": 1006.259, "duration": 19.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "as golfers we better feel what it's like to hit a 150 yard eight iron compared to 130 compared to 180 for some okay right so", "start": 1015.56, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "compared to like okay so that's a stable feel what I just felt what if I did the same thing but from here I just felt this stop to let it go okay so if I go", "start": 1024.919, "duration": 18.702}
{"chunk": "up yeah and you'll see feels so bad but you can sure feel the golf club release yeah in a totally", "start": 1034.54, "duration": 17.958000000000002}
{"chunk": "different way you can feel the opposite end of the spectrum there right yeah you can feel like a totally different pattern so like you're motoring it with the chest is huge for", "start": 1043.579, "duration": 20.402}
{"chunk": "stabilizing the face you're huge yeah here's another one I think on that note Luke bracky teaches this often where", "start": 1053.36, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "I love this look tell me what you think of this teach so if I put that there in essence I've got perpendicular lines", "start": 1061.88, "duration": 15.479999999999999}
{"chunk": "if I did the same I've got parallel lines okay got it so if I kept those lines parallel oh yeah that's a great visual yeah yeah that's a loop bracky", "start": 1069.26, "duration": 18.14}
{"chunk": "okay right up bang even if I turned see they're almost parallel they're staying the same they stay parallel that's right that's a", "start": 1078.86, "duration": 17.738}
{"chunk": "recipe for Club face stability right recipe for Club face to build and eventually obviously that's going to go we're not just going right it's going to go but as long as the chest keeps", "start": 1087.799, "duration": 17.342}
{"chunk": "motoring that's a great way to like stabilize the club face through the strike and it's a common one I hear a lot right is like they get worried about", "start": 1095.96, "duration": 16.8}
