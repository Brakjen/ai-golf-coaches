{"chunk": "what up te what up dude today we get to talk about should you strengthen your grip in your golf swing", "start": 0.52, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "[Music] H I think this was last night yeah you sent me a text you go let's talk about", "start": 10.0, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "this uhuh can you fill in the folks on what it is that you want to talk about you crazy man yeah when I was first taught a lot of things in golf and a lot", "start": 19.6, "duration": 15.159}
{"chunk": "of things I read in books and whatnot right they they classify a strong grip as essentially a a a lead hand that's", "start": 27.679, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "rotated over this way so pronated pronated and a trail hand that would be you know matching the lead hand so so sated a little bit okay um you know and", "start": 36.239, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "I see a lot of people I even played with a guy yesterday played with a guy at Common Ground who uh I don't hopefully he doesn't see this video and uh I", "start": 46.36, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "wanted to like to like shout at him right cuz he was like he's like I just took a less of my Pro he wanted to me to strengthen my grip right so he he started doing this all day right okay so", "start": 54.12, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "he very very excessive in terms of like um you'd see some like cup in the lead hand when he's up here to dress y see a lot of Knuckles on this lead hand you", "start": 63.16, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "see this this Trail hand really rotated under okay I think it's um a misunderstanding when it comes to like", "start": 71.52, "duration": 16.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "what grip strength actually is I think somewhere in the past it got lost in translation I see really really good players they have strong grips meaning", "start": 79.64, "duration": 20.68}
{"chunk": "that they have anatomically strong grips they're able to to grip the golf club in ways that support the strongest orientation of their joints talking", "start": 89.24, "duration": 16.278}
{"chunk": "about pressure in strength or are you talking about joint configuration both both both joint configuration and pressure so you know there's this other", "start": 97.799, "duration": 17.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "idea um you know I think I heard this from like Sam Sneed back in the day right he's like okay hold this thing like a baby baby bird right don't grip", "start": 106.759, "duration": 15.681}
{"chunk": "it hard enough that you're going to squeeze the life out of the bird yeah okay well that's not my experience least right so you know when I get my hands on", "start": 115.36, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "there appropriately and you know I feel I feel appropriate pressure in between both of the hands in the right areas I feel like I'm going to probably squeeze the life out of a bird a little bit okay", "start": 122.479, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "so Le let's let's grade that so on like a 1 to 10 so one is like you're barely holding on to the club mhm and a 10 is", "start": 132.2, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "as much pressure as you can put on the handle yeah where you live you know I'm thinking this is more in 67 range what I'm playing with is the idea that you", "start": 139.76, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "know you've got to you got to have tension in certain right and people think of tension as like this dirty word like I don't want any tension in my golf", "start": 148.4, "duration": 17.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "swing well you got to you got to have tension appropriate enough where you can hold this golf club and control the club face through the Impact Zone so when it", "start": 156.72, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "comes to like Club face stability this guy had a nightmare of Club face stability yesterday cuz he's got his hands on there like this and he's also", "start": 164.92, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "got the unconscious idea that I'm not supposed to grip it too hard so it's going to flash it's going to flash like crazy right so you know every once once in a while you time that up", "start": 172.56, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "appropriately and you're like wow this is actually something but then you know n out of 10 shots it's going two different directions right so I think", "start": 181.239, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "that that's just a misunderstanding a strong grip like you just described is a lead hand wrist yes that is pronated yes", "start": 189.959, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "and a trail wrist that is supinated yes so it's funny that we call both of those things strong mhm the opposite of that", "start": 199.12, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "super to the lead and pron to the trail would be considered a weak grip correct but you can have a fairly strong lead", "start": 207.92, "duration": 19.841}
{"chunk": "hand and an opposing weak Trail hand and be balanced and neutral AB absolutely or vice versa however what you're talking", "start": 217.0, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "about just in like this like neutral space for joints like the text that I got from you yesterday was super awesome because in I can't remember exactly how", "start": 226.92, "duration": 19.159}
{"chunk": "you worded it te but in essence we want to talk about how strength of grip is not necessarily a bad thing no", "start": 236.159, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "absolutely not when we're classifying it in our terms of strength there you go okay and and I feel like that would be anatomically exactly a video we did um", "start": 244.439, "duration": 19.88}
{"chunk": "very recently on Main system of the golf swing yes so like all in here upper arms right we're not doing much with the hands right so you know in my eyes", "start": 254.439, "duration": 19.762}
{"chunk": "you're to to anatomically strengthen the grip yep you're also using the whole basically main system to kind of", "start": 263.84, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "compress all one thing it's all one thing right let's let's let's take some video and and shoot this maybe from down the line but we'll also take some video", "start": 272.199, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "face on so we can see kind of the state of the hands and what they're just generally looking like okay okay and what I'd like to see from a lot of", "start": 280.199, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "players for Mo for the most part is a is a hand system that's a little bit higher which makes TJ go into more UD here in", "start": 289.199, "duration": 17.001}
{"chunk": "both hands got it okay so UD is way and also have the handle work up almost in front of the player's lead thigh what", "start": 297.28, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "that does is it gets the the shaft and the lead arm on plane if you will but it also creates more extension in this Trail wrist which is really nice for", "start": 305.759, "duration": 16.081000000000003}
{"chunk": "feeling pressure Direction like if you put pressure hold this up just a little bit and just pressure the shaft into my hand feel all that mhm there's the", "start": 314.0, "duration": 16.118}
{"chunk": "pressure AB so now we're going to have some amount of that feel just at a dress so if you sat there and felt that same", "start": 321.759, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "little bit of pressure in here it almost sets you up for where the where you're going to pressurize the golf ball the H absolutely so it kind of presets impact just a little bit just a little bit", "start": 330.639, "duration": 15.438999999999998}
{"chunk": "exactly let's just hit one from right there okay just looks nice so is there the sense athletically just the Sensation", "start": 338.479, "duration": 20.319}
{"chunk": "that like above it you can almost feel what impact's going to like the hit's going to feel like with that yeah which I think is important I mean you know", "start": 353.919, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "there there's only so much room you have for like like thoughts right right so like I think it's really important to", "start": 363.68, "duration": 15.639000000000001}
{"chunk": "have this like sense of what what the strike's going to feel like and then you just kind of let your body organize yeah we need some amount of lizard mode like", "start": 371.28, "duration": 16.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "reptile brain mode right instead of like okay I got these seven different things that I need to organize that are like highly cognitive yeah most see people", "start": 379.08, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "just stand above it and like walk out they're like dude it just you can't you I see this one a lot where people can organize all those things in their net", "start": 386.919, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "yeah and that they get really good at at really heady stuff like I can do all these seven things and hit a ball flush in my net and then they get out here in the golf course and there's all these", "start": 394.56, "duration": 17.118}
{"chunk": "other things they have to consider yes you don't have the mental brain power to do it to see this let's do this in front of the camera te from right here so show", "start": 403.599, "duration": 17.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "the just like an overe exaggeration of the gentleman's name that you uh uh grip that you played with yesterday good now", "start": 411.88, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "when you see this in that same head space that we were talking about just now of like okay I can feel the strike", "start": 420.24, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "it is incredibly difficult to feel the hit that you want but you will darn well feel the face being able to flash", "start": 428.0, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "through here so yeah so you can feel rope hook right there oh yeah yeah like if I wanted to rope hook one I might even set up that way you may do it if", "start": 435.72, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "you got to move it 40 yards in the air and blinker mode it yeah absolutely so when we're set up above it and gripping it here you'll see how much flexion", "start": 444.44, "duration": 19.16}
{"chunk": "State we have in this right wrist yes to be able to supinate that heavily and grab onto the stick yes so when I'm here", "start": 453.479, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "there is no pressure at all it's just in this webbing right that's like this is what we're pressuring and you'll also feel like you can just rotate that up", "start": 460.52, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "over the shaft so you'll feel how the golf club can just flash right which I mean if you've had trouble slicing the golf ball I mean it's a way to at least", "start": 470.319, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "feel an opposite orientation but I don't think get your duct tape out that's exactly right that's the problem with is it's not necessarily the right way to go", "start": 479.52, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "about it's not not that it's wrong you can hit good golf shots that way it's just I agree the oftenness of it okay so", "start": 487.4, "duration": 15.718}
{"chunk": "let's do that again te right there it set up excellent so show where the if the handle were just kind of right underneath your midline", "start": 494.919, "duration": 17.722}
{"chunk": "it' be back a little bit so that's not radial but it's more in a radial sphere so first thing is we're just going to pop that up towards the camera you can", "start": 503.68, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "see how the hands now go in into UD uhh and then now if the handle goes forward I love that look cuz we got more extension here you can feel that", "start": 511.879, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "pressure in the trail hand yep but the lead arm and shaft are all on one plane as well right yep so now same thing stay", "start": 520.32, "duration": 16.761}
{"chunk": "dropped in put pressure on the ball oh feel how nice the golf club unloads there yeah did you just make it I mean", "start": 528.04, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "that was good good that's pretty good that was so DIY okay so and by the way when I'm saying put pressure on the ball", "start": 538.16, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "let's go ahead and set up one more time te and let's just hover it just a foot or so above the ground so right in here like once te is", "start": 547.16, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "set up which is really nice you see how similar that setup is even though we're hovering it compared to the last shot if you put pressure here on both of my", "start": 557.519, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "hands equally there I see there we go so not not here and not there ex exactly we're pressuring the entire instrument forward", "start": 565.8, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "that's the strike feel feel that a good feel that's like even pressure yes even pressure so once you get into to delivery so go ahead and go into like to", "start": 574.399, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "P sixish right in there's good okay now how and again above the ball but how would you put pressure on that like pressure wall that I always cre there it", "start": 582.56, "duration": 15.159}
{"chunk": "goes see how the center of mass of the club goes but all of this is unloaded and that's usually felt for most players kind of in that trail hand to feel that", "start": 590.8, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "hit okay uh-huh stay dropped in put pressure on the ball flushed", "start": 599.12, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "out this is a little fat but not bad uhhuh little fat okay let's hit one more actually went further so maybe took the", "start": 613.2, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "spin off of it nice okay so let's do that and the nice thing is is like we just brought this up earlier", "start": 621.76, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "it you don't need to go okay what's the math equation on why I hit it fat yeah no there's no awareness there an objective response is great okay hit it", "start": 629.88, "duration": 20.081}
{"chunk": "fat now just know just generally where you're putting pressure on the golf ball right and through that hit and you'll be", "start": 639.36, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "just fine there's not this big cognitive description that you have to have it's just getting into setup properly know the pressure sense that pressure stay", "start": 648.8, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "dropped in and flush beautiful beautiful strike now we're getting warmed up yeah that's such a good ball right there", "start": 657.279, "duration": 18.323}
{"chunk": "excellent okay so wrapping this up I mean really we we just need to change some of the language I think is just", "start": 669.56, "duration": 15.079999999999998}
{"chunk": "defining what strength in grip is what what we want is to find strength joint strength human strength in the opposing", "start": 677.36, "duration": 19.96}
{"chunk": "of each arm yes right like if the lead arm is internally rotated well the trail should be internally rotated but our favorite and most preferred grips are", "start": 687.48, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "more the internal State and and pronated state to get the hands on there it just feels so much stronger and then just getting the hand more in a UD shape with", "start": 695.079, "duration": 19.081}
{"chunk": "a little bit of of lean in the shaft you'll see that in TJ's grip like even from there like see that state of extension there's a small amount of like", "start": 705.04, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "extension or cupping there in that trail hand that's a really strong place place to to play golf from you can really feel the pressure on the on the golf ball", "start": 714.16, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "absolutely kind of fun yeah real fun okay uh ask questions there's a lot of stuff in there I mean just the RIS complex alone has", "start": 723.279, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "several bones let alone your digits then we're talking like elbows and like the shoulder complex is crazy too so all that stuff affects the strength of your", "start": 732.56, "duration": 23.0}
{"chunk": "grip comment we'd love to chat with you he [Music]", "start": 742.56, "duration": 16.367}
