{"chunk": "what up fool what up dude we get to talk about shoulder turn today sir a lot of misconceptions around shoulder turn loads of misconceptions and we're going", "start": 0.64, "duration": 15.921}
{"chunk": "to set them all straight today let's do it ready to do it yes [Music] sir this is what's so cool about the", "start": 9.4, "duration": 17.979}
{"chunk": "shoulder so keep this one here like it doesn't move at all in space okay and move that Dow in a circular manner kind of like boat drill but this one doesn't", "start": 20.16, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "move good so like right here and I'll do this to the side you can see like right now see how just the right shoulder is", "start": 29.0, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "moving in space but the lead is not moving at all there's so many different things that we can it doesn't mean like that because I'm moving this right", "start": 37.68, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "shoulder complex that the left one now has to move it's not just this clunky thing like we can move this you move independent yeah exactly okay which is", "start": 46.239, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "nice because as I do that what that shows like this action right here see how like this whole chest line gets gets spread sure because of how I'm moving", "start": 54.84, "duration": 18.159000000000002}
{"chunk": "this this one there you go exactly so this isn't really moving in space it it did but you can see that it got pulled on because all of this tissue is", "start": 63.519, "duration": 17.441}
{"chunk": "elongated it's loaded yeah right across this chest line here exactly exactly okay so if you grab that dowel again for us sure how we would like to see the", "start": 72.6, "duration": 18.279}
{"chunk": "chest line or the shoulder line move in space here there a small version of", "start": 81.36, "duration": 17.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "that is this so this now is the back swing see how the the Dow almost climbs and then as you turn goes in here and", "start": 92.119, "duration": 18.282}
{"chunk": "then it falls down and then you turn again go ahead and and give them booty view what we'll see is the Dow initially", "start": 101.92, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "almost climbs straight up but what that does is the scap is elevating meaning it's going vertical it is yeah then you'll start to", "start": 110.32, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "turn and now from here we'll go to scap depression this scap's going to go down so now the Dow is going straight down then we'll", "start": 117.36, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "turn so it's interesting enough you go straight down the line again just to be able to see this in 3D space the first little move there goes the D see it's almost", "start": 126.64, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "going straight up in the air this Dow is going up absolutely it's not going here no it isn't so shoulder turn we hear a lot of like turn the shoulders and", "start": 136.08, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "people just flash this over and then they'll throw this vertical and over so we see kind of the opposite shap made", "start": 143.28, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "exactly now this is really cool if you pair that into where the golf club is just going to swing in space okay I'll be the golf club okay you got it okay so", "start": 151.68, "duration": 16.359}
{"chunk": "if you didn't have any arms and this was just thrown around based on the forces that the shoulder line is is is throwing show the improper improper okay so it", "start": 160.64, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "goes in here then there see where that Golf Club worked okay now I show proper okay there's how the golf club worked", "start": 168.64, "duration": 19.2}
{"chunk": "which that's how the instruments designed what the shoulders do how they move in space will help to affect where the golf club wants to move in space", "start": 181.64, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "good good okay I like that which is really helpful and handy this notion of the under spiral is really important luk", "start": 190.84, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "brachi ISM right there's this underaction under see where I'm throwing Force it's this way it's like a throwing softball I'm here I'm not overhand right", "start": 199.599, "duration": 19.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "so if I'm over on this way sure and again this is the problem that people have because if you're thinking about shoulder rotation in the idea that I'm", "start": 209.159, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "just rotating this level you have a massive problem because the first thing that you're going to do is throw the golf club under the plane sure and", "start": 219.159, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "nobody's just going to let the golf club keep going under forever eventually I got to lift it so I'm going to lift it late and now by that time I'm turning", "start": 227.68, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "already and now it's out here in space it's just whacked out yeah so like this this look where I'm turning lift and turn is improper", "start": 236.36, "duration": 19.721}
{"chunk": "because that's not how the instruments designed MH we like it to get up on the plane a little bit so if I let this happen see how vertical this look is yes", "start": 246.28, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "right well where does that throw the golf club out above the plane out above the plane so now if I if I throw it above the plane and then turn just that", "start": 254.959, "duration": 19.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "action makes the golf club want to seek this space sure and now from here even if I depress this now I keep it going under and then I turn so the whole look", "start": 263.88, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "would look vertical turn vertical turn love it it's just a different way to motor the golf club in space sure so the way that we're controlling that club", "start": 273.479, "duration": 15.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "moving above and below the plane is through the shoulders exactly scap elevation to get the club moving above", "start": 281.84, "duration": 15.278}
{"chunk": "the plane there you go then I can turn and then scap depression to get it falling below the plane there you go exactly and then I can turn exactly the", "start": 288.759, "duration": 17.122}
{"chunk": "other thing that we'll see that people get get in trouble with is they'll turn in this manner so really this isn't moving in Space the left shoulder is the", "start": 298.4, "duration": 15.160000000000002}
{"chunk": "one that's moving out and way so we see that a lot yeah we see that a lot where people crash into the space and they have to extend to get up which is whack", "start": 305.56, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "too so instead if I just am focused on this right right shoulder complex feeling like it gets a little vertical and then starts to turn that moves me", "start": 313.08, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "away in this space yeah so you can really just focus on what's going on in this circular manner it's elating or working vertical now it's working on a", "start": 322.72, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "horizontal plane now it's working on a vertical plane and on a horizontal plane it's this shape that's it and what's interesting", "start": 332.08, "duration": 18.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "like most people when we show them this they go feels kind of good it does it feels H like I can impart Force onto an", "start": 341.479, "duration": 20.481}
{"chunk": "object how moves man totally yes it just feels nice y so let's do this hit me a shot TJ and this might not even look", "start": 350.96, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "necessarily golf okay from like the ribs down no movement motor the golf club in space", "start": 358.68, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "because of how you're moving this whole right shoulder complex but really what we're talking about is moving the scal", "start": 367.24, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "appropriately there you go and just chip one into the screen just a little chippy one okay but you your pelvic line better not move at", "start": 375.24, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "all cool is that kind of what you're after there you bet we're moving this actively and passively moving the center mass of", "start": 384.0, "duration": 16.599}
{"chunk": "the club head in space this region where is it going to move based on the the scap's movement there you go now if you just", "start": 392.599, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "made that a little bit bigger other things are going to respond so the pelvis can move the knees might move the feet might move blah blah blah so in that move I mean you didn't see the", "start": 401.639, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "pelvis move cuz the shape was very small but if I made that shape even bigger then the rest of the body starts to respond is kind of the idea right okay", "start": 410.88, "duration": 15.559}
{"chunk": "yep so I can just make a bigger shape now and allow my body to respond to it exactly there you go pretty cool but what's nice is like", "start": 418.879, "duration": 18.878}
{"chunk": "now instead of like trying to affect the pelvis trying to affect the hips trying to affect the knees Foot Action all that", "start": 433.479, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "stuff you're focused hyperfocused on one specific sure joint complex MH this right shoulder complex right in here yep", "start": 440.96, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "and it affects everything else in a in an effective way cool if you feel like you don't have any space I can create more space by moving the right right", "start": 450.919, "duration": 16.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "shoulder complex away if I need the club to fall down underneath the plane more then I can let it fall in here as it depresses more you can play with it so", "start": 458.44, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "that your swing just feels nice that's cool yeah so if if the golf club's doing something you don't want it to do you can play with these moves add more in certain areas exactly to to influence", "start": 467.68, "duration": 18.478}
{"chunk": "what that instrument's doing cuz in essence what we're doing is we're talking about two directionalities y we're talking about a vertical plane and", "start": 477.199, "duration": 15.241999999999999}
{"chunk": "we're talking about a horizontal plane okay and now you can just add or subtract from that and mess with the sequence of it sure if I don't have it", "start": 484.56, "duration": 19.320000000000004}
{"chunk": "up on top of the plane like long enough I'm going horizontal too early so I need more more more vertical then I need that horizontal so if people can't get here", "start": 493.96, "duration": 19.159}
{"chunk": "then they just go uh this way so it's going horizontal too early and see how that affects the directionality of the center mass of the club head absolutely", "start": 503.599, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "so it's kind of like vertical there you go horizontal vertical horizontal exactly that's exactly what it is is it", "start": 511.52, "duration": 16.679}
{"chunk": "kind of like that it's exactly like that yep yeah and what's nice is now when I've got the the golf club Motoring in that space like now it's in here yep I", "start": 519.959, "duration": 18.521}
{"chunk": "can just go boom right into the back of the ball this way so I'm not hitting down on it I'm hitting level into it", "start": 529.48, "duration": 16.041}
{"chunk": "it's here this is this is the down part I need this to go down then level there it is there's the hit so", "start": 537.2, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "it's just different maps on how we're moving this but we're affecting this through what I'm what I'm doing in the shoulder complex got it and of course", "start": 545.64, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "yeah are there other movements yes tons yeah but what we're talking about right now is this idea this notion of what shoulder rotation is and we just see it", "start": 553.6, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "all the time this is not shoulder rotation no this is thoracic spine rotation sure sure and it's just", "start": 562.839, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "improper we're not level we're this way so like see when I'm making the shape looks looks like an infinity sign right here mhm this is the infinity that we're", "start": 570.32, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "looking for there's Infinities in everything that we do right where the where the pressure in the feet is going what we're doing in the shoulder complex", "start": 579.48, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "it's all this like curvy nature makes you feel like a snake yeah vertebrates baby that's proper shoulder rotation yes", "start": 587.32, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "sir yeah baby hip flushers [Music]", "start": 595.6, "duration": 20.72}
{"chunk": "he", "start": 605.72, "duration": 3.0}
