{"chunk": "however you want to say it yeah it feels good and the reason it feels good is it feels like you have control over this yes right like some leverage over the", "start": 733.74, "duration": 15.120000000000001}

{"chunk": "now I can't turn anymore and that's typically because of a space issue I've got to create space late so the arms can go ahead and shoot ah so that's where", "start": 759.06, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "that comes in so if I'm getting this thing close yep then I'm eventually going to have to stand up extend and add this throw action exactly", "start": 767.82, "duration": 21.3}
{"chunk": "or you could turn it away so go back to where you were yeah there you go so go into that delivery where you feel like you get close again good", "start": 777.42, "duration": 17.998}
{"chunk": "now if you took this whole lead shoulder and sternum and felt like it's turning on a curve on this angle that way like", "start": 786.839, "duration": 20.820999999999998}
{"chunk": "up back and away from you okay just set this behind the golf ball what are you there you got all the room in the world to get that back down there", "start": 796.92, "duration": 15.421000000000001}
{"chunk": "that's why we like chest rotation ah because it curves the sternum away and it gives you the space needed here for the arms and the golf club to shoot", "start": 805.38, "duration": 18.42}

{"chunk": "club like the the face will turn over and the and the unload will be up yep because you're just extension whether it's in the hips or in the spine or all", "start": 842.22, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "of it and you lose all that so you lose bottom out you lose face stability you lose everything and now you can't control the golf ball so now if we move", "start": 851.16, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "the chest the way we just showed there those joints moving up and away now you can basically feel like you actually let", "start": 859.86, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "the golf club go and release it fairly I mean I don't know what the word is but you should get it out get get the energy out which is where we started", "start": 867.6, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "with distal the golf club's designed on top it goes under it goes out yeah out meaning release it yeah and good movers", "start": 875.82, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "meaning they can still rotate their chest through the strike they get the energy out as early as they want okay", "start": 883.44, "duration": 16.018}
{"chunk": "okay yeah so last thing with proximal is how this pelvis pelvic system works the reason that we want the drop", "start": 890.339, "duration": 18.542}
{"chunk": "is so that I can turn this sternum away because there's two different ways to create the room needed I can either extend in the hips and now this goes", "start": 900.54, "duration": 16.739}
{"chunk": "away so this generally I feel like I can at least release it right if I drop and don't turn I can't do that and that doesn't feel good yes so the two", "start": 909.06, "duration": 18.180999999999997}
{"chunk": "different ways to get the sternum moving away is either to extend in the in the spine and if I keep extending the spine it's going to leak into my pelvis or I'm", "start": 918.48, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "going to rotate the pelvis early which is Trail hip extension which leaks into oh now I've got space again and I can hit it", "start": 926.82, "duration": 15.660000000000002}
{"chunk": "but again we don't necessarily prefer that pattern because the bottom out gets wacky potentially and the face rotation", "start": 934.5, "duration": 15.359000000000002}
{"chunk": "is probably going to go up so we like this drop now I'm dropping so the sternum", "start": 942.0, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "is doing what I told it not to it's getting closer right okay got it but now I can curve it away so I have the space all of a sudden got it so you can't", "start": 949.62, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "stand and turn the only way you can curve it away is if you drop first right if you drop first okay and the more you drop the more you're able to curve it", "start": 959.16, "duration": 15.178999999999998}
{"chunk": "away yep exactly we get that comment a lot too is like if you drop that Bunch aren't you aren't you just gonna like run it into the ground well you can if", "start": 966.779, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "you just fire the arms from here so that's an inappropriate match-up yes drop fire the arms such a common question common comment exactly so", "start": 974.639, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "instead we want this this rib system again it's from the sternum and we like the sternum because that's where the humerus attaches and it's kind of a", "start": 982.44, "duration": 15.661}
{"chunk": "middle point to see this spacing for the arms right so it's like okay if I drop and now I just turn the sternum up back and", "start": 990.36, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "away this way oh now I've got the room I'm fine and you can shoot the energy out all day and it's going to be an appropriate amount of like", "start": 999.6, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "a way for the arms to release okay so if they drop they can't they can't stop that process of turning that's where they'll run into the ground", "start": 1007.699, "duration": 15.36}

{"chunk": "between them together is that where we're going with us exactly so this is the arms because if you understand the arms and typically what's nice is if you", "start": 1040.52, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "understand the the club system like if it's up then the arms are probably gonna light in the backswing it's up then the arms are probably going to respond", "start": 1049.58, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "correctly if it goes under then chances are the arms will respond correctly but just a general rule of thumb again is", "start": 1057.559, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "like how the humerus sits into the shoulder socket how it swings freely is on a bit of an angle here so like if you see runners run they're running this way", "start": 1065.72, "duration": 18.661}
{"chunk": "they don't run this way and they don't run this way right unless they're five years old like my two-year-old daughters okay so when they run it's here so how", "start": 1075.08, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "this this works like this is called shoulder flexion this is shoulder extension that's how the humerus swings really freely in its socket", "start": 1084.799, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
