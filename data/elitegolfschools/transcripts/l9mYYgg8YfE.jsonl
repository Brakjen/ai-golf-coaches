{"chunk": "this you are free to move how you want okay okay so by me saying mythbust what I'm really saying is that there are", "start": 11.599, "duration": 19.481}
{"chunk": "other options of movement [Music] M so we're going to start this with uh", "start": 21.56, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "the Sneed drill sure so this idea of Sneed drill like the basket drill so if I put a ball or a basket right here and I drop the basket yes that would be", "start": 31.88, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "external rotation of the femur which is this movement yes okay and I'm saying don't do that so don't externally rotate", "start": 41.399, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "the femur uhuh drop the bucket no go no go okay why is that I want to just let it sit for a", "start": 49.96, "duration": 16.198}
{"chunk": "second okay as soon as I externally rotate the femurs I have actively rotated the", "start": 58.879, "duration": 18.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "pelvis and the pelvic system becomes the main locomoter for uh rotation so if TJ goes right up here to the top and in", "start": 67.64, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "essence this patella or your kneecap starts to move towards the target actively so I'm going to actively move this this way see that so if I had the", "start": 77.72, "duration": 19.081}
{"chunk": "basket right here and I went drop the basket because I'm motoring this look at the axis of my of my pelvis I'm going to", "start": 87.4, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "do this slowly if the kneecap starts to rotate towards the towards the target so I'm externally rotating this see it's pulling on the pelvis actively totally", "start": 95.04, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "and it's rotated me open in the transitional phas so if the cough club's up here and I go motor motor motor motor motor see where I'm at yes so I got to", "start": 104.36, "duration": 20.759}
{"chunk": "fix this if I'm worth a darn as a golfer H how am I going to fix it te you're probably going to hang back tilt right you go this way so there you go so the", "start": 114.399, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "pivot point of my of my bins gets right down here in like my Naval uhuh so I'm going to go this way oh look I fixed the golf club doesn't that look right spot", "start": 123.039, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "that looks right yeah uhhuh so but I'm motoring this way uh so where are all the forces going to throw the handle and what's the golf club going to do our", "start": 132.959, "duration": 17.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "grading system I'm going that's a good movement or not one is it precise okay so if I go here", "start": 141.76, "duration": 19.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "and here I'm adding rotation to the face an increased level of face rotation so I have more opportunity to hook it more", "start": 150.319, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "opportunity to cut it okay I've also screwed up the bottom out okay okay how did you screw up the bottom out well because if this is going here now the", "start": 159.28, "duration": 16.881}
{"chunk": "pivots right down here is where the bottom wants to be yeah it wants to be back here uhhuh so I've got to also fix that somehow drag", "start": 167.92, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "yep and now you're dragging this forward and there goes the face so I don't have bottom amount control as well as well as another system mhm and I've increased", "start": 175.879, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "the rate of of rotation in the face in the face got it okay so not as much Precision mhm can I still create speed yes no difference in speed so grading", "start": 184.68, "duration": 18.479000000000003}
{"chunk": "system there is fine okay so lost Precision but I'm fine with speed okay and then we have health every study like look up TPI and", "start": 193.959, "duration": 18.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "they're like main their top three reasons for injury is all l-spine extension L spine extension L spine", "start": 202.76, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "extension so lower spine yeah because what they're talking about is the reverse C which is extension of the hips this look okay so now I have l-spine", "start": 210.599, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "extension okay okay the other one uh I can't remember exactly how they phrase it but in essence it's stacking up on this lead side so now I have to extend", "start": 219.519, "duration": 18.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "to the top okay so no pressure shifts got it and then early rotation is the third TPI study yeah early rotation of", "start": 228.599, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "of what like pelvis this right so if I'm in here I'm early rotated yeah towards the target my midline is here so now I got to fix it", "start": 238.239, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "which would lead to little Lum more spine extension so in essence it's like hip slide pelvic slide L spine extension is what they're talking about right", "start": 247.439, "duration": 16.122}
{"chunk": "they're just putting it in golf terms like reverse C every golfer knows what the reverse C is at finish right like let's look at a like a picture so if I", "start": 255.48, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "go here step this movement right here is some somewhat of what looks like an AB duction move so AB would be this way yep", "start": 262.759, "duration": 20.28}
{"chunk": "okay but it's not because again what's making that move it's actually going a first cuz I'm moving this into the space", "start": 274.039, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "as a pitcher yeah you'll see that a lot with like guys who are really powerful in their wind up you'll see that that there's like it moves across almost", "start": 282.52, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "before it goes exactly so and is a it's a pitcher unwinding right here no that would be horrible bro hor that's a good", "start": 291.4, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "visual don't okay so if I do this I'm going to blow out yeah okay so it doesn't make sense in that game but what I should do in in", "start": 299.96, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "our game is do this totally that doesn't make sense no okay okay so if I'm back here and I'm moving into this space the axis of where my pelvis is pointing uh", "start": 307.88, "duration": 20.199}
{"chunk": "and where the femur line is shrinks shrinks does this go external or internal because of that internal", "start": 317.639, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "internal yeah so I didn't get up here and just flash this out of here sneak drill uhuh the reason that it looks like there's more space and there is more", "start": 325.72, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "space that happens in this transitional phase is because as I drop they separate if I'm in a squat rack and I squat", "start": 334.44, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "properly yes my knees separate they do but I didn't I'm not squatting this way exactly it doesn't work just by", "start": 342.479, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "focusing on like re-rooting and dropping here through transition the pelvis rotates and the pelvis rotates into this", "start": 351.4, "duration": 15.238999999999999}
{"chunk": "leg so would that be external or internal internal internal cuz as I'm dropping here if I drop here this is the", "start": 358.639, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "pelvis is moving lateral during this phase so it's adducting and it's working internal yeah in this space and then d", "start": 367.68, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "as I turn here here's here's chest rotation here's the hit yep okay what happens to the pelvis well it's going to", "start": 376.96, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "get drug on so the pelvis is rotating this way the femur last so it continues to just go internal all the way to finish but it doesn't make sense to go", "start": 384.84, "duration": 19.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "flash it external and then crash it internal late it's like a jam out and then okay", "start": 394.639, "duration": 15.040000000000001}
{"chunk": "now here I can go again uhuh so it's not just this s exit one clean just rotational move through the ball right", "start": 402.039, "duration": 15.440999999999999}
{"chunk": "so what we would like to see the preference is from one to five from P1 to P5 yep that my midline just continues", "start": 409.8, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "to rotate this way oh so I'm going lateral now as I turn then I'm going to start to drop see see how I just keep", "start": 417.0, "duration": 15.481000000000002}
{"chunk": "turning this way yeah so this is all the way to P5 so as you're dropping and reentering the midline is still moving", "start": 425.52, "duration": 15.838000000000001}
{"chunk": "there going that way exctly exactly but because I'm dropping now I'm going adduction and this because of the drop this is why we see we get this comment a", "start": 432.879, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "lot well why do you see every single dude on the PGA tour rotate their pelvis first before their chest okay well well", "start": 442.639, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "because as I drop dropping wants this to go back to neutral what is this doing it's continuing to go here and that's why we see this dissociation but my", "start": 450.039, "duration": 18.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "argument here is that this is not an active thought to rotate this and keep this going this way this doesn't look right no but if I just keep rotating", "start": 459.96, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "this and then I drop this is trying to go back to neutral so we see it start to open the axis of the hip start to open not arguing that at all and guys that", "start": 467.96, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "are phenomenal at dropping and re-rooting into the ground to actually look like they get more dissociation in the pelvis because of the drop because", "start": 476.639, "duration": 15.962000000000002}
{"chunk": "of the drop like everything they're so good at creating like this big old stretch here in their thoracic as they drop like that looks just ey test it's", "start": 484.84, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "like that looks right yeah but I didn't try to rotate my hips I just tried to drop right yes you got the midline of the chest it keeps going going going it", "start": 493.96, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "just keeps motoring this way all the way to five cuz what we want the ability to do is in here once I've gotten to five", "start": 502.919, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "now I can start to rotate here at that's the active thought I've got chest rotation to hit and just like if I got", "start": 511.319, "duration": 15.399}
{"chunk": "an axe or a sledgehammer or something I want to murder right here yeah I'm not going to go that wouldn't make any sense I'm going to blow out everything down in", "start": 519.839, "duration": 17.002}
{"chunk": "here yeah I'm going to drop in here and then hit it really does create um a very interesting visual when you start to relate this to other athletic movements", "start": 528.24, "duration": 17.519}
