{"chunk": "thing back here back here back here back here back here and never let it go right that's another just like does not happen", "start": 420.56, "duration": 16.241}

{"chunk": "load up the fascia in a way where it wants to snap back down across you sort of as its own accord right so that's the whole goal is to actually energize the", "start": 446.44, "duration": 19.999}
{"chunk": "arms so that they can fire and hit yep um so yeah it's just counterintuitive to sort of leave it back there and just", "start": 456.28, "duration": 16.041}
{"chunk": "yeah yeah exactly and and again like we're not speaking to feels right now no yeah certain players need that feel", "start": 464.24, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "because they're so active in like lowering this lead arm right and see that all the time which is why a lot of our videos that we've put in the past", "start": 473.639, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "are going to help a lot of people because sure you know they they need to feel like this goes a lot later they need to feel like that happens very very late yep um but it's not what happens in", "start": 482.28, "duration": 21.199}
{"chunk": "actuality and if some players take that to an extreme they're going to have some problems yes and a lot of the the folks", "start": 492.12, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "that were fortunate enough to coach it they will put themselves put themselves in that box MH of like okay I I see", "start": 499.919, "duration": 19.841}
{"chunk": "rotation so that means I need to shallow it a ton and d d and they'll just overcook everything right and like pretty soon they just overseason their", "start": 510.08, "duration": 19.438000000000002}

{"chunk": "but you don't see like a ton and a lot of like patterns why you see a ton Anders like leino or", "start": 535.32, "duration": 18.439999999999998}

{"chunk": "fine he just has a lot of this yep well if I did a lot of that where would that Golf Club go continue shallowing and shallowing so we see this bigger larger", "start": 553.12, "duration": 16.599}

{"chunk": "moves in the space because we're trading from lead side Bend to Trail side Bend and that's the main Center of mass shallower but just that little bit is probably good for most people like just", "start": 570.0, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "a little bit of bump here just to get that club working more in that space instead of this space and then even when you move it into that space don't be afraid to just hit that's the whole", "start": 579.2, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "point of moving it into that space yeah exactly so that now you can go and hit these freaking like thumpy ones that feel great okay so let's see one that's", "start": 588.2, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "like this will be super easy to just kind of move in this in the space we've got this like halfway back know how the ribs are are moving to create side Bend", "start": 596.68, "duration": 18.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "and control the golf club and then you just hit with the arms they fire beautiful so there's a little", "start": 605.72, "duration": 15.000000000000002}
