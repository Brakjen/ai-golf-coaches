{"chunk": "we want to do from here? Well, the club face and my chest are both pointing in the same direction. If I turn my chest, oo, I manage the club face. And what", "start": 2403.76, "duration": 17.919}

{"chunk": "it's just it's raw. Okay. So, to answer that question, the biggest difference in baseball swings is just hand action. So,", "start": 2499.04, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "for me to send a baseball to right field or left field or center field, it's all based on where the the the the bat is in", "start": 2508.96, "duration": 16.879}

{"chunk": "if I do that in baseball, it's fine. I can hit one into left field real easily that way because I just get out ahead of it and freaking hit here. Or if I'm a", "start": 2560.16, "duration": 17.038999999999998}

{"chunk": "most of the time for good baseball players, the first thing to take a look at is how do you manage the face? And most of the time we need a way stronger", "start": 2577.119, "duration": 20.121}

{"chunk": "is to get here and then go wham, I lose all of that. So just fix the face earlier and into delivery for sure. And", "start": 2631.76, "duration": 15.439}
