{"chunk": "way better by just making a lot less mistakes right you don't have to make more birdies to play better you just got to minimize the mistakes what was the it", "start": 1260.78, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "was one more what was the difference between a person who shoots in the 90s and someone who shoots 79 is one more", "start": 1269.12, "duration": 17.599}

{"chunk": "two-putted and they look at it they go wow I would shoot 15 shots better and it's like yeah exactly without without doing anything swing related there's", "start": 1312.08, "duration": 19.38}
{"chunk": "trev's low-hanging fruit right there it's like grab that one yeah let's start there right so for any any beginner level player any just golfer who's", "start": 1321.38, "duration": 18.360000000000003}
{"chunk": "looking to get better right keep those tiger five stats okay so what are all five what are all the tiger files again so let's go over them so we have three", "start": 1330.44, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "putts two chips two chips and what are what what is two chips so explain so if someone who's like if you're I would say within 20 yards of the green I think 20", "start": 1339.5, "duration": 19.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "yards is kind of a decent area so you're close to the green yeah if you're shot from that 20 yard area does does not get", "start": 1349.58, "duration": 17.700000000000003}
{"chunk": "onto the putting surface so you have to use your wedge to chip right twice or if you're in the bunker and you got to hit two bunker shots yeah like you leave the", "start": 1358.4, "duration": 15.299999999999999}
{"chunk": "first one in the bunker yeah right that would be considered a two chip okay all right so there's two chips we have three putts two chips always with pitching", "start": 1366.38, "duration": 15.9}
{"chunk": "wedge or less okay so Bogies with pitching wedge or less so most let's just go with the average", "start": 1374.12, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "player and include 120 yeah maybe yeah and if you add ladies maybe the average goes down to like 100 yards right okay", "start": 1381.14, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "so the average golfer hits a pitching wedge 100 yards so we're talking about that distance right there right", "start": 1389.72, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "absolutely and I think we we use pitching wedge as a baseline for like those are usually your scoring clubs in your golf bag yeah right you wouldn't", "start": 1399.2, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "expect yourself to hit it close with a seven or six iron those wedges are the ones that you can hit the closest as you're closer to the green obviously it's a little easier to make good", "start": 1408.02, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "contact with those golf exactly and then you have bogeys on par fives okay Bogey's on parking and double bogus okay so what do you guys think really leads", "start": 1416.96, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "to let's let's let's ask this question what leads to a double like what's the usually it is one bad swing followed up", "start": 1426.32, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "with a mental error okay because bad swings happen but then it is probably a poor decision following said mistake", "start": 1435.679, "duration": 16.380000000000003}
{"chunk": "that's then links into the next one right I would say again I think it depends on the player that are keeping these stats like", "start": 1444.62, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "if you get a beginner to intermediate level like it's very it's very frequently for them to just get it out it just happens yeah they're gonna hit it out of bounds every", "start": 1452.84, "duration": 16.141000000000002}
{"chunk": "once in a while on the t-box because again you make very poor swings that'll happen if we're looking at a more higher level junior level high school college", "start": 1460.88, "duration": 19.259999999999998}
{"chunk": "level golfer I think what Travis saying is totally correct I think the majority of the time they're making correct lines off the Tee Box so they're not", "start": 1469.94, "duration": 18.779}

{"chunk": "entire rest of my hole yeah right so now the judgment is a little clouded right the thinking isn't as clear over the next golf shot maybe they're trying to", "start": 1486.98, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "get too aggressive because they hit themselves out of position yeah right it really is like exactly what he said one bad swing that results in the rest of", "start": 1495.38, "duration": 17.820999999999998}
{"chunk": "the hole being kind of faltered yeah okay all right cool and then a bogey On a par five that can happen but here's one that here's one", "start": 1503.9, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "that I would suggest we even look at and I know what I don't I don't want to get too far away from a practice plan but one of the things that", "start": 1513.86, "duration": 20.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "leads to mistakes on a golf course is playing from the wrong team area big time okay so when I was growing up", "start": 1523.4, "duration": 22.26}
{"chunk": "we had names like men's teams and ladies teens right which is not the that's not right the tease", "start": 1534.74, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "that you pick should be based on your ability to hit the ball to the approach area designed on the course right right", "start": 1544.46, "duration": 15.479}

{"chunk": "again we can make a lot of mistakes just based on what you said decision making well here's one I'm learning left-handed", "start": 1560.48, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "and I'm not playing from the tips I'm going up to the white tees you like proudly play like two tea boxes", "start": 1569.9, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "I was like you guys do this I'm going up there because you know your level of golf left-handed is not as high as it would be from the back Tee Box yeah and", "start": 1578.419, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "I'm just I know I'm gonna shoot a hundred and something from the tips because I'm just not even physically capable yet of like keeping it there", "start": 1586.7, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "there's the answer to your practice man so there's what 110 I had all these terrible stats what if I just went up to one two boxes you just cut it in half", "start": 1594.26, "duration": 17.98}
{"chunk": "yeah and yeah what would my stats look like from a t-box up or two tea boxes and see if they shrink seriously there's your", "start": 1602.5, "duration": 18.101999999999997}
{"chunk": "answer there's a short-term answer yes that's your fixed today right yeah there's there's another how do I how do I get 10 shots better right right yeah", "start": 1613.94, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "yeah so what were your guys's practice plans like when you were on a college team like what did you guys do so I mean", "start": 1622.22, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "when lobeck and I were at Mesa we had I think we had a pretty regimented putting where he had speed", "start": 1629.12, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "uh like short drill so I guess you could consider it line yeah but then also pressure we had this terrible game called six under where you", "start": 1639.52, "duration": 19.059}
{"chunk": "have three T's set up at four five and six feet to simulate par putts and three T's at like 15 18 and 21 feet to simulate birdie putts because that's", "start": 1648.919, "duration": 18.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "probably what your birdies and parklets are kind of look like you keep generalized usually those putts those distances are based on like the tour averages of like what your birdie putts", "start": 1658.4, "duration": 18.659}
{"chunk": "would look like on certain holes and what your par putts would look like on certain holes okay so you're simulating like what it would be like on the golf course you just keep cycling around so if you", "start": 1668.059, "duration": 19.162}
{"chunk": "make the birdie one under miss the par Smokey you go to one over so it was maker mix it wasn't too putting or playing it out it was just make or Miss and you go round and round around around", "start": 1680.0, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "until you get the 600. so that was the update all day yeah and it didn't take all day that was the epitome of I mean", "start": 1689.12, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "you needed to mentally be there and I mean you went through the emotions of playing a tournament because you would get to three under then all of a sudden you don't make any birdies because stats", "start": 1697.76, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "and then you just get frustrated Miss par and all of a sudden you're two of them are just like I want to walk off this golf course and get in a car and go home yeah exactly so I think that was", "start": 1706.64, "duration": 17.001}
{"chunk": "great and then when it came to full swing he he left us on our own because he to be fair we also had I", "start": 1714.86, "duration": 15.34}
{"chunk": "think a good team that was mature enough to kind of do our own thing but we all had an idea of what we needed to do so for me I would work on alignment and I", "start": 1723.08, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "would work on more like like Tempo because my tendency was to get quick and then the ball would turn over a lot and then routine because I", "start": 1732.38, "duration": 17.579}

{"chunk": "knew your game there you go and that's the thing now you touched on something that I I thought was very interesting was pressure", "start": 1978.26, "duration": 20.999}
{"chunk": "so competition players guys who guys who play you know Under Pressure you also", "start": 1987.44, "duration": 15.9}
{"chunk": "have to learn how your body reacts there because that changes everything right question is holy shoot how do you this", "start": 1996.019, "duration": 17.339}

{"chunk": "you simulate that for a high level player and approach them to yeah there would be my first crack at it I'd have two different", "start": 2070.96, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "the first one would be when you're doing pressure drills like a 600 drill or simulating on the Range you know the pins tuck left walk create", "start": 2080.08, "duration": 18.539}
{"chunk": "like a scenario you have to have some sense of buy-in mentally go I am treating this as such and I need to go through", "start": 2089.619, "duration": 16.201}

{"chunk": "18th one I just put in the water I need to go do it again kind of thing yeah so I think part of its buy-in yeah when you declare this I'm simulating it you need", "start": 2107.2, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "to actually yeah like be in it the other one would be this one for the range is block practice", "start": 2115.48, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "where you set up a station where you hit at a specific Target but you're going through your pre-shot routine your whatever your swing thoughts or whatever", "start": 2123.339, "duration": 16.919}

{"chunk": "that where you block practice at a specific Target just Hit balls non-stop seeing where they kind of go the other one for off the tee", "start": 2149.98, "duration": 16.500999999999998}
