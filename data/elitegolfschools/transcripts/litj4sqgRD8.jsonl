{"chunk": "well today we get to talk about something fun we're going to actually tell you don't lift the arms in the back swing", "start": 0.32, "duration": 17.438}
{"chunk": "what I think just a good like General kind of understanding where we're going to go with this where we're going to try to go with this okay is uh Force", "start": 14.32, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "Direction in the arms in the arms got it okay so uh first general question do the arms swing up and down do they actually", "start": 22.72, "duration": 20.76}
{"chunk": "do that well that's that's a complicated answer I think right I think that's one that's probably going to have a lot of debate to it um I think when I was", "start": 33.36, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "taught as a kid I I was taught that they swing more up and down right through shoulder flexion and extension that sort of deal um but now I'm not so", "start": 41.719, "duration": 19.521}
{"chunk": "sure okay so here's the the operative word is force Direction okay Force Direction okay so let's just look at", "start": 50.92, "duration": 15.358}
{"chunk": "like certain certain uh swinging mechanisms MH so if you're sitting in a swing set and you go Riley push me right yeah okay which direction do I initially", "start": 59.039, "duration": 20.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "push you that way that way so we would call it like kind of a horizontal Vector I'm pushing in that direction level to the ground and when you start off you", "start": 68.759, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "get chugging and you're going this way but then pretty soon which direction do you start going up you start going up uhhuh oh", "start": 76.759, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "interesting so if I go or like if I'm pushing you and it's kind of this like casual will push and you're kind of swinging and you're like this is all well and good but I want to go higher", "start": 84.68, "duration": 18.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "Riley MH right you'll say higher higher right like every little kid's like higher Dad yep and then where does Dad push do they do this all of a sudden no", "start": 93.32, "duration": 19.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "they just push harder in that same direction correct and eventually where does the kid go further up further up", "start": 104.479, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "because right above dad is the lever or the fulcrum yes ah Force Direction okay okay so is this shoulder", "start": 111.52, "duration": 21.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "flexion just that act yeah right yes it is is this shoulder flexion it is yeah so it's all shoulder flexion but most", "start": 121.96, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "people go shoulder flexion is arm lift and they're wrong they're right and wrong they're right and right understand it's dependent upon where they deem they", "start": 130.879, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "need to send the force if they think they need a longer back swing typically I got to lift up here more okay so this is like a massive", "start": 140.64, "duration": 22.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "like in in my humble opinion this is not debatable okay because if we want like a", "start": 150.319, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "a more stable Club face so what is that it's a it's a club face that doesn't rotate as hard through the strike right so it stays stays more or less Square", "start": 159.84, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "here so what TJ is showing yeah and square to what Square to the path you're swinging on there you go a general plane", "start": 169.12, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "or path yeah Square yeah right yep yeah so the the harder that is rotating we would deem that us in our", "start": 176.28, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "Academy as unstable okay okay so if you do this teach go ahead and set up to can be set up to a golf ball sure and swing", "start": 186.56, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "the golf club up and it doesn't need to be crazy exaggerated but send force in the arms up there you go from there the", "start": 194.879, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "player is going to have to stop the arms in some way and the way that you did that is you created an equal and opposite force in the opposing direction", "start": 203.72, "duration": 20.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "or vector interesting okay so to stop the arms going up there forever I had to add a force basically down and we'll be able to see that watch this do that", "start": 213.4, "duration": 18.919}
{"chunk": "again but do it hard okay so it bounces up here feel it like go here and then it slightly bounces back that's the force and we see that in", "start": 223.239, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "fascia yeah so it's bouncing back down vertical in a vertical plane because you sent it vertical so if you this active", "start": 232.56, "duration": 15.079}
{"chunk": "vertical Force you're going to get whether you want it or not another one that comes back down in the same direction exactly and most of the time", "start": 240.48, "duration": 15.321000000000002}
{"chunk": "and kind of not necessarily whether you want it or not because we'll see right players that get up here and then they just start turning they keep it up here right but in general we're going to have", "start": 248.76, "duration": 17.438}
{"chunk": "this like I've got to stop it at some point because my my idea is to send it up and the way to stop that is to to create another force in the opposing", "start": 257.199, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "Direction I see okay okay so now if we're in that transitionary phase up there sure which direction is the force going now down okay and for your body", "start": 265.56, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "cuz your body is always there to support The Swinging action of the arms hands and Club so the arms are going down what would your body have to do in order to", "start": 274.32, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "support that rise exactly because if I just go back here and I just send energy down that's not going to be good relative to", "start": 283.24, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "where the golf ball would be so you've got to create there you go so the space that You' got to create is based on typically we talk about it in hip", "start": 291.96, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "extension or spine extension to create this room that now I can deliver the GOL Golf Club in here yeah that stalls out body rotation and the golf club still", "start": 300.16, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "has force in it so what's it going to do it's going to flash so the the rate of rotation is going to go up for sure there we go so that is a map of how to", "start": 309.8, "duration": 18.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "swing the club of how to swing the club by the way there's some damn good players out there that play that way mhm I would argue that Jimmy Walker is that", "start": 319.0, "duration": 17.158}
{"chunk": "type of a player web Simpson might be that type of a player and we can see that through force in their body yep and typically what we see in force of their", "start": 327.479, "duration": 15.242}
{"chunk": "body like directionality of body like if we're more of an extension kind of a pattern vertical Force player the idea is we're going to send Force downward", "start": 335.36, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "got it Justin Thomas would be one of those guys more vertical Force by the way no freaking hate on those dudes those guys are freaking unreal I ain't on tour they kick my ass all up and down", "start": 343.12, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "they're great right we're just talking about General Maps okay and if you want to get into this more of like a rotational stable face kind of a dude", "start": 351.84, "duration": 17.678}
{"chunk": "mhm we've got to better understand options for Force Direction okay which is also freaking awesome because it's", "start": 360.479, "duration": 15.242}
{"chunk": "Dynamic forces are Dynamic okay like when I'm saying Force I'm saying where are we moving sure okay so let's get back to this like swing set idea let's", "start": 368.08, "duration": 17.438}
{"chunk": "do it so the arms are the chains all right okay go ahead and set up to the golf golf ball okay send the golf club at my shin send", "start": 376.759, "duration": 19.402}
{"chunk": "Force here there you go okay now set up again turn towards the camera don't do", "start": 387.08, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "anything with the arms okay now if you sent the arms and you can pump them too like if the arms came back kind of underneath you and then you set sent force in the club head like the center", "start": 395.28, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "mass of the club at the camera oh that was actually really cool I didn't expect that to happen yeah", "start": 404.8, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "you feel stuff yeah and you see like also what's cool like that lead heel like flashes away cuz like you're you you tap into spiral L immediately you're", "start": 412.56, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "not even thinking about spiral line it's Force Direction so so by trying to send the club at that camera yep here's the lever like we have", "start": 420.08, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "multiple levers there's a lever here there's a lever there there's a lever there it's any joint is a lever MH okay so what you just did is the center mass", "start": 429.68, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "of the club you sent that way but this is Le it's not going to just keep going eventually this is The Swinging point with enough force it did pop up but the", "start": 438.16, "duration": 20.958}
{"chunk": "force Direction is not here it's not up it's there it's very very level that's okay so let's just hit one we'll just start with this idea sure so your your", "start": 447.759, "duration": 18.802}
{"chunk": "job your midline right now is pointing here your chest needs to rotate the midline away so it points more towards the camera and once it does that you", "start": 458.08, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "send Force at the camera through the club head system there you go go ahead and hit one at like 60% beautiful look", "start": 466.08, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "right there midline Force excellent EX excellent okay so now", "start": 473.479, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "let's talk this forward swing so we in your in your mind's eye the force got sent here right it's not sent there it's sent there got it well we would like the", "start": 483.24, "duration": 20.839}
{"chunk": "force then to be sent back forward again okay and this shoulder complex is super interesting because it can do a lot of things okay if I go into shoulder", "start": 493.84, "duration": 15.801}
{"chunk": "flexion I can go right back down into extension of the shoulder sure but we don't need to do that if we have a different m match up okay so the first", "start": 501.4, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "match up if I have this like vertical Force vertical Force right I'm running the arms down I've got a stand to create room correct well if I go turn", "start": 510.72, "duration": 16.838}
{"chunk": "horizontal Force here so I sent Force away from here if I drop like think of especially in my spine just in general", "start": 519.039, "duration": 16.882}
{"chunk": "my spine's on this angle if I drop so I'm going into more hip flexion this way uhuh here my spine starts to move it starts to move in this direction yeah", "start": 527.32, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "starts to change incline a little bit for sure that's exactly L right and perpendicular to that to my spine in", "start": 536.2, "duration": 16.678}
{"chunk": "general if I'm dropping what all of a sudden is perpendicular to my spine the golf ball okay exactly interesting so if", "start": 544.279, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "this arm gets sent boom back away so it's in shoulder flexion as I drop now I can I don't have to send Force down I don't have to go into extension of the", "start": 552.0, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "shoulder anymore instead I can go straight into AB duction this hit okay which force direction is that going", "start": 560.839, "duration": 17.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "that's that's level again that's level again so it's not this vertical idea so instead of extension flexion like and that probably will happen a little bit", "start": 569.72, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "right here's what you're saying but um it's more of yes so so AB duction yes so AB just so like we're defining things AB", "start": 578.12, "duration": 18.798}
{"chunk": "duction is away from you a d add duction is into got it okay so in the hit once we've gone midline turn send Force away", "start": 587.079, "duration": 17.082}
{"chunk": "MH now I'm dropping but see I'm not doing anything with my arms yet they're just floating in space back here the lead arm will AB duct as the trail arm", "start": 596.0, "duration": 21.36}
{"chunk": "ad ducts abduct goes across there you go and that's the hit ah so now we start to", "start": 605.56, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "look more like if I've got an Axe and I'm hitting a like trying to axe a tree or I have a sledgehammer trying to freaking Hammer a wall boom see the", "start": 614.72, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "force Direction in your mind's eye you're sending Force this way so to get the golf Club down here all we need is", "start": 623.8, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "to drop more so that yeah so see how TJ spine now is on this angle yep so perpendicular angle is here well guess", "start": 630.519, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "what's down there interesting okay map map okay okay so let's hit one at like 60% but we're going to feel midline turn", "start": 638.44, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "away okay know the force direction away once that once that Golf Club gets sent away you're going to drop and level", "start": 648.76, "duration": 18.519}
{"chunk": "hit the arms go for for that's so good just do that all buffed off like 60% or but with that map got to focus here", "start": 657.839, "duration": 19.801}
{"chunk": "uhhuh good better no better and what this is how you lower the rate the the rate of rotation in in the club cuz if I'm", "start": 667.72, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "throwing Force here the golf club's going to continue to work forward so if this is going down right and I stand to create that room well eventually it's", "start": 682.56, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "going to go forward I can't support that cuz I'm done rotating right so there goes the club that's interesting so the rotation allows you to support the golf", "start": 691.48, "duration": 17.838}
{"chunk": "club a little bit right and if we ditch it all immediately we don't we're not able to do that anymore exactly and this is what's interesting too we work with a", "start": 700.399, "duration": 15.642000000000001}
{"chunk": "lot of players obviously and like I think players watch our Channel or Instagram or whatever and they're like oh dude it's a rotational swing I need", "start": 707.72, "duration": 18.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "to rotate more and how much did you think about rotating towards the target zero yeah absolutely freaking zero you", "start": 716.839, "duration": 15.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "will rotate if you're if you're half an athlete you're going to rotate because like think of this direction again if there's this like say it's a uh I've", "start": 724.839, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "just got a wall here and I wanted to punch the wall so the direction in my mind I'm not going down to hit the wall I'm going that way yep so like right", "start": 734.48, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "there te go ahead and ball up your fist over there on the right side just pump me how much did you think about turning none again but but I'm turning", "start": 742.839, "duration": 19.961}
{"chunk": "you're fully rotated yeah so that's B like the rotation just happens due to the intention of where I'm trying to send the force exactly and the body is", "start": 752.16, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "always there to just support The Swinging action of the arms so it's playing a supportive role rather than this active role of like rotate rotate", "start": 761.6, "duration": 15.997999999999998}
{"chunk": "rotate like how like If I Had a Hammer and I just go oh man it's like the dumbest like kind of kind of blowing my mind a little bit cuz even even kind of", "start": 769.519, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "when I when I started learning this system I was I thought the same thing I was like I'm learning a rotational system right I'm trying to learn how to", "start": 778.839, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "rotate my body but kind of how we just described it like the body is going to respond to our directionality of the", "start": 786.279, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "arms yes that's a whole different map at least in my mind of at least we're to direct intention even our stupid terms in golf there's a back swing and then", "start": 794.24, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "there's a down swing it's not a back swing and a forward swing nobody ever says that it goes back and then down like oh yeah", "start": 803.36, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "interesting it's just we set ourselves up for failure just with these words which create Ms Right interesting so do that again so this is what's kind of fun", "start": 812.88, "duration": 16.118}
{"chunk": "too cuz there's just we just have Force direction map here and body supports it sure hit one like I don't know you got seven iron right yep okay hit one 140", "start": 821.079, "duration": 20.122}
{"chunk": "140 140 yards just flushed out but you just know Force direction we got turn level there you go now now we're going", "start": 830.88, "duration": 16.238}
{"chunk": "to drop and forward direction of the arms they don't go down at all you drop and move them forward now that's this is cool thin", "start": 839.079, "duration": 18.881}
{"chunk": "heavy pure heavy as heavy heavy as okay so what does that tell you about the force direction of the arms actually probably two down there", "start": 850.72, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "you go so we need more forward so and that's what I felt with the last one as well like when I actually felt this like kind of active forward level hit uhuh", "start": 859.36, "duration": 15.798}
{"chunk": "that lined everything lined everything up so even though it's it's a 140 yard shot we're taking some off of it just think of it as like if you had a quaky", "start": 868.079, "duration": 17.962}
{"chunk": "right here and an axe in your hand right an aspen Tre so a little bitty thing and a big heavy axe you're not going ripping if you want to chip it right right", "start": 876.88, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "you're just tapping like there's the hit but that's a forward Direction even if you're trying to hit down here you're not trying to throw the axe down you're still trying to throw the axe forward", "start": 885.0, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "there you go interesting yeah it's a forward Vector changes the intention so last one I got I got in here yep and", "start": 894.279, "duration": 16.761}
{"chunk": "this one we're going to that's exactly right and look how stable that b move at all yes and that's probably the easiest way for anyone to get their way around a", "start": 901.92, "duration": 17.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "golf course like dude exactly and so like I mean you if you're going to be like really fairly accomplished in this", "start": 916.32, "duration": 19.719}
{"chunk": "game you do not play golf stock stock stock stock stock same energy no cuz you're play in different wind conditions", "start": 926.12, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "and all kinds of stuff like you're going to sometime if you hit let's say you're a beast and you hit 7 iron 180 but it's into the fan 30 m hour uh", "start": 934.519, "duration": 19.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "you're going go well I guess I'll hit six iron just rip it still you're going to lose the ball you'll lose the ball sure you've got to be able to like go", "start": 944.56, "duration": 15.238999999999999}
{"chunk": "okay it's into the fan by 30 m hourish and go s iron from like 150 and still control the face if you have this", "start": 951.16, "duration": 16.359}
{"chunk": "downward path up to give it room boom and the face is doing this like have a fun day the harder you swing at it the more it rotates at that point right the", "start": 959.519, "duration": 16.322}
{"chunk": "because the harder you throw a vertical Force down yep the more the face is going to rotate the more you're going to extend up yep so you're just handcuffed", "start": 968.16, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "you're handcuffed so so in this way like if Our intention with regardless of whatever shot is more or less a level hit yep you can control whatever energy", "start": 975.88, "duration": 15.918}
{"chunk": "put you put whatever you want into it basically so watch this here now we're having fun no we know Force Direction just hit one stock NOW St but you better", "start": 984.199, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "damn well flush one all right yes sir but we know Force Direction we've got good maps Bo forward", "start": 992.079, "duration": 22.36}
