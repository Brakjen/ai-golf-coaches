{"chunk": "because it's I it's easy to like understand you're like hey man your body's been moving a certain way for a long time and it's obviously not the", "start": 488.159, "duration": 18.439999999999998}

{"chunk": "you're right like you want to do anything movement related golf related muscle related like it's all it's all stems back into the brain like your brain has", "start": 505.8, "duration": 20.119}
{"chunk": "that your your brain has that movement ingrained in the brain and the body just does it because that's what subconscious like it just subconsciously happens the", "start": 514.68, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "brain calls the shots oh 100% that's why like you that's why you do stuff and you're like I don't even realize why I did it it just happens yeah so when", "start": 523.919, "duration": 16.281}
{"chunk": "you've been swinging the golf club for the same way for your entire life and you're like I need to make some changes like that's why it requires such like", "start": 532.48, "duration": 15.918}
{"chunk": "conscious level effort yes to make that those changes you've been making changes in your golf swing", "start": 540.079, "duration": 21.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "for you know with two months yeah I uh yeah we're going on two months I yeah two months so in that in that time", "start": 549.72, "duration": 22.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "frame what has like how do you define success or how do you define kind of improvement in what you've been working on yeah", "start": 561.0, "duration": 19.559}
{"chunk": "so with with him we've we've identified handful of areas let's say in the swing", "start": 570.839, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "now it's all part of the same system or it's all part of one motion we have just broken it up so we have these these", "start": 579.079, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "markers at certain points this is kind of where we'd like to see things moving whether it's the club the body Etc so we", "start": 589.279, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "then tailor we've tailored a couple DS drills focusing on those areas so I've posted on um Elite social of you might", "start": 597.44, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "see me looking like a dork with an alignment stick through my belt loops on the ground a pool noodle behind me and people have been asking what's", "start": 607.68, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "that thing on your arm it's from George ganis it's the Gbox or the G shallower so if you come across this podcast", "start": 617.399, "duration": 15.64}
{"chunk": "you've seen it that's what it is um shout out George that's really cool Gadget and I would have never thought of using it until working with this guy so", "start": 624.839, "duration": 19.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "some devices can be good you don't want to look like the guy who's got 30 of them on or the guy you don't want to look like Tin Cup too many anyway um all", "start": 634.72, "duration": 21.36}
{"chunk": "of that stuff all jokes aside has a purpose so I'll get into the details for me a little bit you know trying to rotate and get around so the alignment", "start": 645.6, "duration": 19.838}
{"chunk": "stick through my n the through the hip through the waistband needs to hit that noodle before the club hits the ball now that's like a feel and a real but it's", "start": 655.639, "duration": 17.642}
{"chunk": "oh I have to rotate and get around versus is throw if I throw my arms the alignment stick never gets to the Noodle", "start": 664.56, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "so that's one so when I'm doing drills that's what I'm looking for and Tyler preaches this and I love I love the", "start": 672.16, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "phrase so I've adopted it it's no pretty swings like ugly swings only like and Riley talks about this a lot too don't", "start": 680.68, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "you dare try and hit this shot don't you dare try to make a pretty swing do the movement if you focus on the movement over time you will hit the ball better", "start": 689.16, "duration": 18.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "long term if you try to hit the ball you're G to do it how you know y so I hit a ball I go okay cool did I do it", "start": 698.959, "duration": 17.281}
{"chunk": "and I'll record myself and that's all I'm looking at is did the alignment stick hit the noodle before the club hit the ball am I getting rotated and it's", "start": 707.36, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "like yes no pass fail and then if it didn't I look okay well it's probably because of my arms lower versus my body", "start": 715.72, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "rotating so then the next five to 10 reps maybe I go a little slower maybe I break it down but it's the same end goal", "start": 723.76, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "the alignment Sig has to hit the noodle before the the club does so the golf ball is simply there as giving me", "start": 732.0, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "something to hit for real versus practice swing because we all make really good practice swings because there's nothing to hit at right but the ball there now we want to try and hit", "start": 740.959, "duration": 18.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "the ball versus the move so for me when you focus on the", "start": 749.12, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "move again the ball it's it's kind of this like contradictory thing don't focus on the ball but yet if you start moving good the ball is gonna respond so", "start": 757.68, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "it's like yeah don't look too much into it but also you can use it as an indicator but it's not this life or death pass or fail based on what the", "start": 766.72, "duration": 16.759}
{"chunk": "ball did yeah what I what I really like about that is like you're giving your like you're like you said like this is a black and white drill it's very easy to", "start": 775.079, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "tell yourself did I do it correctly or did I not right if you record yourself it's like very easy did linan stick hit that before yes okay good like that's", "start": 783.48, "duration": 19.121}
{"chunk": "like a check mark and then good you look at the golf ball and I've always used the example that like the the golf ball just provides us feedback for what the", "start": 792.92, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "body did right so like if you're doing if you're working on if anyone's working on some sort of drill like we've all there are thousands of drill drills that", "start": 801.279, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "everyone works on from across in across the world and the in like the game of golf so like everyone's got their own drills if you saw the golf ball is more", "start": 809.68, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "just feedback for how the body's moving or feedback for how you're swinging the golf club then that that that'll help", "start": 818.399, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "you kind of figure out what's going on very quickly like you're able you're able to hit a golf shot you see what the golf ball does okay goes this way goes", "start": 825.6, "duration": 19.479}
{"chunk": "that way whatever then you can assess and kind of break down what happened make those adjustments for like the next swing so now you're you're giving like", "start": 836.48, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "every swing you've got a nice purpose to it and you're consciously having to kind of focus on every single swing you make", "start": 845.639, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "it's not just okay swing golf ball okay rake swing golf ball like now there's like you've got a methodical purpose to it and that's how like I've I've watched", "start": 852.72, "duration": 19.721}
{"chunk": "you practice for a decade now but like you're like psychotic when it comes to the process C that you go through on the Range yeah TJ and Riley gave me crap", "start": 863.04, "duration": 19.88}
