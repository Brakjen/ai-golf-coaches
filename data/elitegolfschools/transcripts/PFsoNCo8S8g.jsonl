{"chunk": "are we rolling we're rolling we're hot we're hot we got a new vid what are we talking about rhythm Rhythm baby okay so here's like", "start": 18.26, "duration": 21.219}
{"chunk": "here's the thing rhythm is such a stupid stupid term because everybody we'll look at a golf swing and go oh dude I don't know why it doesn't feel", "start": 28.859, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "that great just hit it with better Tempo just show better Rhythm and then they just stand there and it's like me saying TJ Show me a really", "start": 38.04, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "good backswing and you're brand new to the game you're like okay you have no idea and I'm just saying good backswing show me good backswing with no like", "start": 45.84, "duration": 16.981}
{"chunk": "articulation on how to get there so there's not a lot of good articulation out there on like what good Rhythm actually is that's right you know it when you see it yeah and there's but", "start": 54.36, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "yeah exactly like if you look you could go buy a bag of golf balls from the Pro Shop walk out and just stand and look at everybody on the Range and you could go", "start": 62.82, "duration": 19.859}
{"chunk": "oh good golf swing cruddy horrible great golf swing and then somebody goes well why is that one better than that one and people just stumble all over themselves", "start": 72.299, "duration": 17.941}
{"chunk": "most of the time what we're seeing is beautiful like management of loading and unloading which we see as Beauty and", "start": 81.06, "duration": 20.579}
{"chunk": "Rhythm Tempo like that's that's what it is but then ask somebody to explain what good rhythm is they go right there's all these like little", "start": 91.86, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "credit like cheats just show me uh you need a slow back swing and then hit it like there's all these like little like try this try that and it doesn't have", "start": 101.04, "duration": 20.7}
{"chunk": "this like real deep understanding of why that dude looks better than that dude and their positions might be almost exactly the same sure yeah", "start": 111.24, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "so that's it good luck what I would really like to do is is go about this from the standpoint that you need to understand", "start": 120.84, "duration": 18.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "that rhythm is earned you don't just like say have good Rhythm or feel this one thing and then all of a sudden you just", "start": 130.2, "duration": 17.520000000000003}
{"chunk": "have it a lot of it is based on quality of movement sequencing of movement all of those things are really really important absolutely so let's start with", "start": 138.9, "duration": 16.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "that and then we can start into managing movement a little bit better okay so when we talk about the chest is the engine we mean it", "start": 147.72, "duration": 19.318}
{"chunk": "it moves first always whether it's in the backswing OR transition it's always number one in", "start": 156.959, "duration": 15.602}
{"chunk": "movement like if you look at you like the our favorite movers in history I mean you might be hard-pressed to find one dude on the PGA tour or LPGA Tour", "start": 165.12, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "where you see the arms run up to the top and the arms move first in transition you won't see this dude", "start": 174.0, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "on tour yeah they may feel that I've seen a number of guys try to feel that exercise Justin Rose talks about it all the time right where he's trying to make", "start": 181.319, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "the arms go in here for his system but in reality they're not necessarily actually going arms first then chest exactly that's kind of a goofy look to", "start": 189.66, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "it exactly and every this that's a perfect Point teach because everybody has a different set of principles based on", "start": 198.42, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "what they need for their golf swing to to be able to like execute down below like they want and everybody's a little bit different there John Rahm feels", "start": 206.519, "duration": 16.922}
{"chunk": "better or excuse me not better but different than Justin Rose guaranteed at the bottom yeah he feels different than you he feels different to me everybody has their own fingerprint on this sucker", "start": 215.34, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "okay but like you said the reality is is the chest the rib complex is is what is", "start": 224.34, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "dropping and moving forward first and then here come the arms to hit second it's like you see it in every single player", "start": 232.5, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "what you won't see in every single player is this idea that the that the ribs are going to be moving first like if you look at Houma Homa moves his arms", "start": 241.56, "duration": 20.098}
{"chunk": "first here he does and then now now the now the chest responds but in this in this phase sure we see that", "start": 251.099, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "so our preferred pattern is more stenson-esque Rory ask tiger in 2000", "start": 261.6, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "where the rib complex is actually subtly moving first before the arms go and that's because we are looking to load", "start": 269.34, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "and unload arm lines at appropriate times sure okay so what does that mean load and unload arm lines drop that club for me and let's go anterior and you'll", "start": 278.759, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "be my mannequin alright so this arm line right here if we a b duct abduct we have loaded this arm like", "start": 287.46, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "what's a what do I mean by loaded there teach you've loaded the anterior side of my arm line so I feel it all across here a", "start": 296.58, "duration": 17.579}
{"chunk": "stretch stretches exactly so we're we're the muscle the tendinous tissue fascia all that stuff is getting elongated got it okay and the more that I do this the", "start": 304.919, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "more that you feel that stretch loads loads loads loads loads absolutely a loaded fascia line wants to we talk about it all the time so if we don't", "start": 314.759, "duration": 22.019}
{"chunk": "want this arm complex to unload first in transition so it's not doing this number here we want to be able to move the ribs first", "start": 324.539, "duration": 17.221}
{"chunk": "what we need what would be like a a nice healthy cheat is to slack this this area this anterior line out in the backswing", "start": 334.139, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "so start moving the chest first oh there we go do that again good so this is slacked what actually loaded is the posterior line okay great", "start": 342.3, "duration": 20.999}
{"chunk": "well this is loaded what does a fascial line want to do that's loaded unload okay boink it bounces off", "start": 352.32, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "so let's let's revisit that for a second because for my mind I think a light bulb just went off okay when you load the posterior side the unload slings the arm", "start": 360.24, "duration": 20.1}
{"chunk": "away it's a cheat code baby right so you're not necessarily having to place exactly the golf club to the top it's", "start": 369.96, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "that was beautiful that look was excellent right yep and our favorite this is not always but our favorite", "start": 378.18, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "movers are floaty in transition got you the reason that they're floaty is because they're trading from posterior load to anterior load", "start": 385.38, "duration": 18.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "and that takes time yeah okay so if I'm loaded here I've bounced this off as it's bouncing off", "start": 395.0, "duration": 17.14}
{"chunk": "into space here like in the transition phase of like P3 to P5 kind of in this area boom", "start": 403.8, "duration": 15.658999999999999}
{"chunk": "boom so we need to know where we're active and not active sure we're active early because I need to load the posterior", "start": 411.6, "duration": 18.660999999999998}
{"chunk": "Side by making the ribs move into the trail arm good bounces off flow now we're loaded in anterior side", "start": 421.08, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "because this has stayed back here notice how TJ and TJ does this so well his ribs dropped and started to rotate forward", "start": 429.96, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "what that does is it loads up this anterior line so now now you can hit like it's just so natural from there", "start": 437.0, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "exactly exactly will be no different than anything else like athletic wise I would never throw away baseball from", "start": 446.539, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "here no because my anterior Lee or Trail arm is slacked so I can't there's nothing on it you", "start": 453.9, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "can't Huck it you Huck it because you stretched out all that freaking Jello here and now you can fire yep and that's", "start": 463.38, "duration": 18.478}
{"chunk": "the difference in in golf swing is what TJ just showed the ball what we're leveraging up here is above the center of mass", "start": 472.259, "duration": 17.642}
{"chunk": "so the scap looks different like the scat for throwing like throwing a lacrosse ball throwing a baseball throwing a football elevates and", "start": 481.8, "duration": 16.738}
{"chunk": "protracts so it's this action ah boom and golf is like the underhand action exactly so golf it depresses and then", "start": 489.419, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "protracts so it's under there you go but it still loads the trail so we need time to bounce from posterior", "start": 498.539, "duration": 20.52}
{"chunk": "to lead load and what we're hunting for is an unload of the anterior Trail complex through the strike not not from", "start": 508.86, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "transition because if I go here yeah that's what you'd get if you'd load that early there you go in transition no matter how much you really want to", "start": 518.82, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "bounce the tendency yeah you have no more room for movement here now there's no more range of motion like if I just take", "start": 526.74, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "this don't move my ribs and place the golf club up here where I think it should be anterior line loads like a son of a gun I can't really get you to go further that way no I'm already in range", "start": 535.98, "duration": 17.938}
{"chunk": "of motion so where does it want to unload yep just out and away just gets whacked got you and that's why we see a lot of like lower handicap guys they'll", "start": 545.399, "duration": 19.401}
{"chunk": "anterior load early in the backswing lift it and then this lifting action this wants to unload boom so it bounces", "start": 554.519, "duration": 17.021}
{"chunk": "over the plane so now it's like Rescue Mission yeah exactly that's Rescue Mission yeah I hear what you're saying exactly so this is why I can hear it", "start": 562.92, "duration": 20.099}
{"chunk": "just gets rushed because of that yep tell that guy with that movement pattern good Rhythm just it's fine just show better Rhythm you'll be all right just", "start": 573.36, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "slow down the back swing yeah they have no access to what Rhythm would be yeah because there's there's not going to be any softness up here you can't you're", "start": 581.339, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "rigid as a son of a gun you're done but if you understand the sequencing a little bit better there's a chance for that guy to", "start": 589.019, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "actually have rhythm yep exactly because this can flow gotcha okay so that's just Baseline movement to like get your", "start": 596.88, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "ticket on board the Rhythm machine okay like you have to be able to move that way so this is soft up here okay so that's number one", "start": 605.519, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "number two this is super interesting so when I was a kid like 14 15 years old Golf Digest was like the source right golf golf", "start": 614.64, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "channel I'd like just come out so like I was golf nerd back then so I'm like reading the distance magazine and it's all centered around Davis low", "start": 623.94, "duration": 15.42}
{"chunk": "the third who is just like booty machine he just blast it back then right and one of the sentences that Davis wrote", "start": 631.5, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "when something along the lines of when I'm trying to hit it further with driver my golf swing feels like it takes twice as long", "start": 639.66, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "hmm that's what I did I went that makes no sense I have no idea because to me doesn't that compute is like that sounds like it's a slower action it sounds", "start": 648.72, "duration": 18.059}
{"chunk": "slower okay so not until fairly recently when fortunate enough to meet Luke brackey and he", "start": 657.779, "duration": 16.381}
{"chunk": "started talking about waves I went that actually makes sense now and when we think of waves like let's", "start": 665.339, "duration": 16.279999999999998}
{"chunk": "just talk water waves like Creek waves ripples well they're quick sure you go to San Diego excuse me you", "start": 673.019, "duration": 17.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "go to San Diego boom big waves crest for a long time that takes longer to build them they crest for longer than they crash look at a", "start": 682.56, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "tidal wave then it's up there forever yeah so twice as long we move like jello", "start": 692.16, "duration": 20.7}
{"chunk": "we're not levers and pulleys we need time like the cresting action this time up top takes time it loads", "start": 702.36, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "loading fascia loading tissue is stretching it so I need time to stretch so there's a time between the climb of", "start": 711.36, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "the wave the Crest is the time between that climb and the Crash okay so the more energy", "start": 722.04, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "that I put in early boom the less it doesn't float as long", "start": 729.42, "duration": 18.619}
{"chunk": "boom oh yeah takes less time so a little pitchy one this is obviously gonna take less", "start": 738.779, "duration": 16.7}
{"chunk": "time exactly smaller wave so the active energy in ribs engine boom to move the arms out of", "start": 747.66, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "there big energy wave boom locks the arm out of here you have longer time in between so bigger flow", "start": 755.88, "duration": 15.658999999999999}
{"chunk": "time more flow time right more calm time between the the climbing and the Crash The Climb Boom the crash this is the hit", "start": 763.079, "duration": 23.761}
{"chunk": "yep Okay so we've got this and that are the active energy inputs and what's nice is like that's a good feeling of like", "start": 774.24, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "how much hit am I going to put in like if I got a sledgehammer and I get a wall in front of me and I wanted to knock one brick out like Jenga", "start": 784.74, "duration": 15.540000000000001}
{"chunk": "I could just tap it so I can feel the loads based on how much pressure I'm going to put in that brick if I want to knock the whole thing", "start": 792.66, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "down boom yeah I just naturally you're going to get like from an athletic perspective more stretch more fascial load that takes more time", "start": 800.339, "duration": 17.982}
{"chunk": "sure it's different yeah so we can feel pressure so what do you got there eight nine nine nine hit a nine", "start": 813.48, "duration": 17.54}
{"chunk": "130 all wave-like and TJ has earned this because he moves so well that the ribs are the engine so he has his ticket aboard the Rhythm machine", "start": 821.36, "duration": 19.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "so let's hit one 130 just based on woo energy calm energy beautiful", "start": 831.3, "duration": 16.998}
{"chunk": "okay so I'd be curious to see how long that golf swing took from the time that the golf club moved to the time the golf club stopped okay compared to this one", "start": 842.76, "duration": 16.941}
{"chunk": "we got nine iron yeah hit it 210. okay I'll try see what you got baby but all always wave like so I can't just juice", "start": 850.74, "duration": 17.258}
{"chunk": "the holes you can't just juice the whole system more energy calm energy out foreign", "start": 860.459, "duration": 15.702}
{"chunk": "so from an athletic standpoint which one felt like it took longer between energy and an energy out the second one yeah", "start": 870.66, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "there's what Davis is talking about yeah it takes twice as long that's what he feels what in actuality no it's that's", "start": 879.06, "duration": 15.179}
{"chunk": "not what's really happening his golf swing isn't actually taking twice as long sure it's probably taking longer", "start": 886.98, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "yeah not twice as long but it's taking longer so when you're thinking about just the golf swing in general when it", "start": 894.66, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "comes to Rhythm we need energy in early okay and and understand too we talk about waves because waves are cool", "start": 901.74, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "because there's this gradual transition from energy in to no energy to energy out we're not moving as Lightning moves", "start": 909.48, "duration": 19.618}
{"chunk": "it's not pulses of energy we're going yeah that's what rhythm is in our eyes that's our that's the best movers and so", "start": 919.079, "duration": 18.678}
{"chunk": "when you're looking at golf swings and watch this on tour I mean our our favorite movers move in a similar fashion to that if the golf club", "start": 930.959, "duration": 18.722}
{"chunk": "is floaty up here this is also when guys go sh PGA Tour players they hit it so far and it doesn't look like they're working", "start": 939.72, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "that hard well that's why we're just seeing sequence of movement proper movement we're seeing calm when there should be", "start": 947.76, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "calm we're seeing energy when there should be energy we don't need energy here there's no hit here the ball isn't up here it's down here sure this can be", "start": 955.38, "duration": 18.477999999999998}
{"chunk": "calm hit yeah that's proficiency right that's efficiency yeah so really we're talking two things to earn Rhythm Rhythm", "start": 963.839, "duration": 16.322}
{"chunk": "is a manifestation of these two things sequence of proper movement that's number one that's your take it aboard got it number two is understanding", "start": 972.36, "duration": 19.678}
{"chunk": "how and when you are loading and unloading your system and when there should be calm the calm should be between", "start": 982.079, "duration": 19.022}
{"chunk": "the forward and the backswing that is transition that's why we talk about transition being from like P3 to P5 it's", "start": 991.56, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "not just from P 3.9 to P 4.1 didn't it this isn't transition it's here we see a lot of transitions like that", "start": 999.24, "duration": 16.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "yeah they just run the arms and the reason we see that is because they run the arms early and they run the arms early yeah early early", "start": 1008.74, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "whoa floaty floaty gotcha Rhythm machine baby hey guys thanks for watching that video", "start": 1017.3, "duration": 16.697000000000003}
