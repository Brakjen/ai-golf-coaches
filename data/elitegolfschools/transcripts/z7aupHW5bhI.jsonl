{"chunk": "radial one walking in this is cool what's going on man dude just wedges wedges yeah yeah yeah I'm excited", "start": 12.559, "duration": 19.202}
{"chunk": "to talk about it um me too okay we've got full swing right full swing technique with wedges but then we get into the is like", "start": 21.92, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "mid-range you know so like a 70 yard shot even 50 yard shots those would be considered like distance wedges correct yes a lot of this just has to do with", "start": 30.32, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "like General loads and I would like to play around with this idea of like tissue load okay and how we modify tissue loads first if we start with like", "start": 38.8, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "full swing technique which we talk about full swing all the time so we can kind of just generalize this okay we like to see a little lateral move then a little", "start": 48.68, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "rotation and as the club's finishing dropping in and then you go ahead and turn and shoot it right so and especially like in our last video that", "start": 57.52, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "we did the 3D yes perception of golf swing correct we're talking about like the center mass of your body Center mass of your ribs and pretty much the center", "start": 66.479, "duration": 15.720999999999998}
{"chunk": "mass of the club and how they interact with one another right so this is working away then as the club goes up then I'm getting away from it and then", "start": 75.28, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "here I want to shoot it so in doing that you are going to expand and load all proper tissue", "start": 82.88, "duration": 15.001000000000001}
{"chunk": "collapse that tissue to have this like big bounce system to launch it like you leverage tissue you leverage the club", "start": 90.64, "duration": 15.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "boom pound it pound it yeah if you did that trying to hit a 50 yard shot you're going to run into a hell of a lot of difficulty seen it a lot see it a lot", "start": 98.04, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah yep so could you do me a favor here let's just kind of walk through this and let's go um swing start so it' be like", "start": 107.96, "duration": 17.398}
{"chunk": "load one from 3D look good now show me load two so you're going to turn as that club goes up you're dropping in good so", "start": 116.079, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "what you just did te is you passively adducted this lead arm so see how much this like posterior arm line load is", "start": 124.479, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "just like right now so you got there late if you set up again let's now just get there early so", "start": 132.599, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "just show arm adduction there you go beautiful okay now let's do that again we need to control the bottom out at the", "start": 143.04, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "same time so let's have the center and mass of the ribs float forward while doing that just in the back swing add duct and Float the ribs forward so it's", "start": 152.04, "duration": 19.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "actually so this is distance wedges now so at the same time so adduction folks as well as is this this action here so", "start": 161.879, "duration": 15.242}
{"chunk": "adduct AB duct okay so if I'm adducting while at the same time just allowing my head my ribs to float Target", "start": 168.64, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "bias together like immediately immediately yep they happen together", "start": 177.68, "duration": 17.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "perfect perfect so you're still there we're taking a concept from full swing but we're just doing it earlier so if I", "start": 185.519, "duration": 17.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "go boom big turn big spiral right I haven't loaded this yet as it's going up that I'm dropping in ooh big tissue big", "start": 194.72, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "drops bigger movements okay well all that allows for the golf club to load and leverage up here all the way to four", "start": 202.72, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "right now I'm dropped in now I can turn and send it so that's big full energy right here we're just going add duct with a little rib like rib movement", "start": 210.72, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "forward okay well immediately immediately right away just right in here exactly let's just start with that idea and just hit a one out there", "start": 219.159, "duration": 18.481}
{"chunk": "okay excellent show us a full swing I see the wheels are turning this is fun so just like a so this is stock NOW full", "start": 232.92, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "swing mechanics just I have a 60 in my head yep exactly full swing mechanics okay a lot of like the purpose of this like this bounce so if I'm just", "start": 243.0, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "here this like little play around okay see how if I do this slowly pressure into this right foot see how light my arms respond yes so really what we're", "start": 254.64, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "doing in full swings is it's very much a proximal to distal movement H the the", "start": 263.08, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "the the center mass of me moves first and then it leaks into the arms into the hands and into the club head got it so it's like here out mhm right for like", "start": 271.44, "duration": 20.12}
{"chunk": "big full boom got it and we'd see that in every movement right if I have an axe I'm going to hit a tree the axe might float here for a second as I step and", "start": 282.36, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "then turn it's still there and then I would hit so it's here out got it for big full energy waves from the center out uhuh okay in putting which we'll get", "start": 291.52, "duration": 20.441}
{"chunk": "to okay it's very much a distal approximal okay in that I I'm like let's say that I have a hammer in my hand and", "start": 301.28, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "I got a nail and I got to hit it I'm not like leveraging big actions to be able to hit that nail I'm right here because I get more dexterity with that got it", "start": 309.639, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "right so in putting we need that dexterity that pressure on the ball and if I have small axit from the hands and then it would leak up into the arms and", "start": 318.8, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "then it might leak into the ribs right so it's is disable approximal here we're like tweener so we're just immediately", "start": 326.4, "duration": 15.038}
{"chunk": "getting left because I need to control my bottom out and where the sternum is at the strike really dictates that so I'm just immediately getting left there", "start": 334.039, "duration": 17.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "you go while immediately loading the posterior arm line of the of the lead arm right there there you go so there's not a whole heck of a lot of like Spiral", "start": 342.52, "duration": 19.518}
{"chunk": "movement here to early leverage keep turning load and then bounce out of that right that's just more and more tissue load okay so this is like can I move left so", "start": 352.479, "duration": 18.482}
{"chunk": "there's not a whole lot of rotation here either you will turn some but the main map is lateral movement so I can control", "start": 361.88, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "the bottom mhm and can I load the posterior arm line through adduction really when you are purely adducting", "start": 369.639, "duration": 16.281}
{"chunk": "what what you'll end up doing is the structure of this lead hand as you're doing this will be maintained okay okay", "start": 377.88, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "so in full swing often times we talk about how it's okay to rotate here to Bow a little bit and now I've rotated the face to shut it so we're not getting", "start": 386.0, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "any of that like that strengthens the club face okay if I add duck that doesn't happen and so to leverage the club and typically this happens for", "start": 394.4, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "folks is they'll leverage the club just through radial so there you go so the Leading Edge will stay very vertical it won't be bowed down yep so as this just", "start": 402.84, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "goes let's do that again so as you're just add duct add duct add duct add duct see how this this cup look from the address is maintained so it's here and", "start": 411.84, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "then leveraged so the Leading Edge of the club is fairly vertical rather than if you bowed that down we'd have a stronger face got it okay so how we've", "start": 421.12, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "leveraged the hands is through radial which again that's just hinging the club straight up like the the Leading Edge doesn't rotate on itself at all got it", "start": 428.759, "duration": 15.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "okay so how we would get rid of it is through owner okay this is the unload in distance", "start": 436.72, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "wedges so it's straight down straight down but now and I think it'd be great to do this from face on as well what I'll what I'm about to to explain like", "start": 445.52, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "through the the unwind of the body so from right there and let's do this get rid of the club hug so in essence like back swing body", "start": 454.52, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "is just this like little lateral float forward good and just go there and just freeze and all it is like see how you want to rotate out of there I'd like to", "start": 464.12, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "see you just go here in your mind now you'll rotate a little bit in the chest but it's just Bo little lateral move it's almost like a lateral lunge like if", "start": 472.72, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "I were here I'd just go got it there you go so now from there what I would love to see you do is see how your head's", "start": 481.36, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "forward mhm because we're unloading the golf club down with ner it's goes straight down you're going to rotate the chest up straight up in your mind you'll", "start": 490.039, "duration": 22.239}
{"chunk": "turn but this just go there you go the combo the matchup that I'm talking about here te is in the back swing I've", "start": 500.639, "duration": 15.481000000000002}
{"chunk": "adducted to load posterior I floated the ribs forward to control my my bottom out and for most folks they're going to radial to some degree okay okay so if", "start": 508.879, "duration": 21.441}
{"chunk": "I've gone radial nner is the unload along with this spiraling action up my spine angle that's around in here about", "start": 519.32, "duration": 15.759}
{"chunk": "1\u00b0 is forward so if I if I rotate up this as I'm unloading there's the hit boom", "start": 527.12, "duration": 18.321}
{"chunk": "boom that's it so there's no like big rib movement here to shallow it out cuz see I still have like tons of load if I turn on that this is like a really hard", "start": 536.32, "duration": 18.639}
{"chunk": "aggressive look there you go that's it got it so this is like a softer unload cuz I'm exposing Loft M as I'm rotating", "start": 545.399, "duration": 18.281}
{"chunk": "up this angle two maps rib float and Lead arm adduction good now start getting rid of", "start": 554.12, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "it and as you do you're rotating up your spine plane there you go okay let's go ahead and hit one oh interesting do it again see this is", "start": 563.279, "duration": 21.602}
{"chunk": "what's fun this is what's fun do that again okay okay so swing it", "start": 581.44, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "back good here's oler what you just did is you wanted to pitch it over here's oler now ready start turning", "start": 589.04, "duration": 20.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "see that and even here like see you want to shove the handle out just keep turning and let it hinge back up this way there's there's radial got it so", "start": 600.32, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "it's radial owner back to radial again there you go beautiful let's do it again uhhuh feel the club like goes here", "start": 607.76, "duration": 19.238}
{"chunk": "and then hinges back up on itself because the rotation that was beautifully hit and like athlete does", "start": 623.56, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "that feel like an aggressive ball like what kind of ball does that feel like very under control it's not super aggressive but enough where it might", "start": 630.76, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "spin just a little bit neutral neutral yeah it's not this hard ball it's not some floaty thing it's a neutral kind of a toss yeah so I think a", "start": 639.639, "duration": 19.040000000000003}
{"chunk": "really simple map is like we have a radial okay load to radial unload there you go all that we're doing", "start": 648.959, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "in between is making sure that the center of mass of the ribs is forward enough so that you can control your bottom out through there you go now it's", "start": 658.68, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "a simple clean map got it beautiful can we uh show that from face on absolutely let's definitely do that face absolutely radial radial", "start": 666.04, "duration": 18.759}
{"chunk": "radial radial and how do you control your bottom and little just kind of lean", "start": 678.519, "duration": 17.161}
{"chunk": "uhhuh in the back swing yep exactly beautiful and it's so easy to see like you float like if you want do us a favor", "start": 684.8, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "go look at Joe Mayo's stuff like he's been obsessed for I don't know how long on uh pitching wedges and he's he's like", "start": 700.04, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "over and over again going like look their head moves forward it's this view so CAD view were face on and you'll see", "start": 708.8, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "players like highle players uh pictures on the PJ tour or live or whatever where their nose floats forward in the immediate in the immediate and then even", "start": 716.76, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "through the HP might float forward even more so the further forward and this is kind of the cool match the further forward TJ's Ribs go the earlier he has", "start": 726.639, "duration": 19.761}
{"chunk": "to unload this to to have it work appropriately through the strike the further back your ribs go or your Noggin goes the further forward the handle has", "start": 736.24, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "to go and now we're talking about really aggressive shots like that Ball's going to come out flat with loads of spin which we don't want a ton of that we", "start": 745.12, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "want a nice neutral ball yeah to be able to like hit a 50 yard pitch into greens has the proper amount of spin has the proper launch and it's just again bag of", "start": 752.44, "duration": 19.798}
{"chunk": "sand mode when it lands so the other nice thing with these is we're we're bringing in this active hit this active owner okay okay and it's", "start": 762.399, "duration": 19.48}
{"chunk": "the same like if I have hammer and nail and I go load the hammer unload the hammer I have dexterity here with thiser", "start": 777.04, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "hit so I can feel the amount of pressure that I want to put on the nail right so if I have like a small nail soft piece of wood I can feel that hit if I have a", "start": 785.04, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "a peg that I'm going to like a pylon that I'm going to hit into the ground that's the same hit yeah but it's more pressure so you can feel the hit and the", "start": 795.16, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "pressure you want to put on the ball and you I'm interested like when you have a a shot like that let's say a 60 yard", "start": 804.079, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "shot how do you just generally layman's terms kind of your own like go about hitting that right like going about hitting the right distance getting the", "start": 811.959, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "shot uh honestly like I know some people use like systems to control the yardage I just go at 60 I feel some amount of", "start": 820.88, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "pressure or tension that creates 60 yep and I just hit it there you go right and I think like and that's what we want right like when people go like good", "start": 829.24, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "Athletics what they're talking about is is sens the senses right right so like you're you're behind it going this is 60 you're seeing how far that thing is and", "start": 838.36, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "then it should immediately translate to touch it's the same thing if we're shooting hoops right like I'm not going I'm 7et 4 in from the hoop that means", "start": 846.88, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "that it when you do some math equation mhm you're catching and responding Sho through your senses okay so this is similar to that this just builds up an", "start": 854.56, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "Avenue for the senses like that's exactly right especially in the hands there's a lot of like feel in there a lot of crazy touch right okay throw us", "start": 863.199, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "one between 60 and 70 now same system oo so good I feel the club just hinge right up over your left shoulder", "start": 871.519, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "too there your radial familiar feeling um I'd say that's how I used to hit all of my wedges was like that y yeah yep exactly 66 carry", "start": 879.88, "duration": 18.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "there you pretty good holes I mean we're one yard off of right in the middle of those those yardages that I'm giving you sure so show us stock 100 yard shot", "start": 888.72, "duration": 21.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "right right here 95 yard shot okay freeze there you go you're there this is", "start": 898.839, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "abducted that's floated forward so that's the same dog gone thing as what we were just doing we're just getting there immediately so we", "start": 909.759, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "don't have more tissue load it's the same stuff so the point at which that abduct it changed yep quite dramatically between those two swings Y and I mean", "start": 918.8, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "you can go back 10 10 seconds and just watch TJ's swing start where he has this like little buildup here there's turn and then from here as he drops in and I", "start": 927.72, "duration": 18.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "go ah he's abducted this is floated back forward so all we're doing is just getting here in the immediate so we don't have that extra tissue up I won't", "start": 936.639, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "yell at you this time let's see 95 yard shot okay beautiful and we can just you can see hear feel how much more there is at", "start": 944.759, "duration": 20.36}
{"chunk": "the bottom it's a thump okay that's 103 we go 102 okay show us uh", "start": 956.88, "duration": 19.639}
{"chunk": "62 62 all right oh that's pretty good 55 okay and and one thing like to", "start": 966.519, "duration": 20.599}
{"chunk": "kind of finalize this out let's see a full uh again comfortable how far can you hit it through dist", "start": 982.759, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "wedge mode we'll just see that like so I don't leave kind of like I don't go into like big spirals here or anything I just no", "start": 992.519, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "it's the same technique but it's just as much comfortable energy as you can put in it and we'll see how far the golf ball", "start": 1000.399, "duration": 17.282}
{"chunk": "goes comfortable energy perfect probably 85 90 yards 90 yards okay mine is 85 so I know stock", "start": 1008.6, "duration": 20.6}
{"chunk": "distance wedge is an 85 yard shot got it and so once I get to 90 for me I'm in full swing technique but that's okay CU I don't have to take 10% off of it okay", "start": 1022.0, "duration": 19.639}
{"chunk": "which is reasonable interesting right yeah so so this kind of hits all of them I mean you can hit pitch shots around the green like if you just wanted to", "start": 1031.559, "duration": 18.201}
{"chunk": "like CH hit a pitch 20 20t 20 yards in front like you could do the exact same technique here", "start": 1040.12, "duration": 15.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "it's the same technique in bunkers like as as soon as we as soon as we abduct and work this forward in that lateral lunge look from here we want to get rid", "start": 1049.08, "duration": 15.238}
