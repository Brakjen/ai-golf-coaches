{"chunk": "where the humorous goes mhm goes onto the side of the ribs yep how much can the arms really swing from right there and just I test does that dude look", "start": 217.879, "duration": 21.241}
{"chunk": "right no no he doesn't look right so if you see this guy and like I want my spine to be straight this guy well even if you go", "start": 227.48, "duration": 19.36}
{"chunk": "into spine extension you're your scaps are going to retract it's just how our body works you can't go into scap protraction and extension of the spine", "start": 237.959, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "it's not going to happen it does not work fa fa we don't move that way okay so we want the arms meaning the humorous the", "start": 246.959, "duration": 19.481}

{"chunk": "but a little bit but that's it exactly so if you just stand normal okay just stand like we chat all right", "start": 290.96, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "all right okay good so from there if you just went into a squat like you're in a squat rack right now and you had a squat bar on you okay feel where your pressure", "start": 299.28, "duration": 18.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "is now now drop like you're squatting where's your pressure moving uh does it move more into the balls of the feet when you do that or", "start": 307.72, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "more into the heels I guess more into the heels yes yeah that would be proper so it again", "start": 319.96, "duration": 15.838}
{"chunk": "just like eye test look like if you're looking at this if I squat and I'm going into the balls of my feet this guy compared to this guy you can just tell", "start": 326.919, "duration": 20.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "which one looks better it's funny like eye test is is something that almost everybody should just take into account if it looks right chances are it's right", "start": 337.28, "duration": 20.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "it is right from an athletic perspective fair so where the pressure is going okay from like this north south okay direction is it's moving rearward", "start": 347.96, "duration": 20.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "posterior it's moving that way okay so we're start with that all right so if you set up TJ go ahead and set up like you normally would for a golf swing", "start": 357.88, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "but just set up more heel loaded like the pressure would move there good now try to squat okay yeah I'm already there so I", "start": 366.479, "duration": 17.038000000000004}
{"chunk": "can't go further back so you have room to move this way there you go so what is that yeah there's your hip extension there's hip extension so if we get to", "start": 376.36, "duration": 18.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "the top like what we want to be able to do is drop okay and if I'm already in my heels just in", "start": 385.759, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "setup right like if I'm sitting back into these heel like that's where my pressure is and I swing it to the top and I try to drop you're not going to have room to be able to do it and you", "start": 394.68, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "got all the room the other way yeah that's interesting that's really interesting okay so we want to preset almost to the point in like learning this it would be really cool to overdo", "start": 403.759, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "this cuz we've kind of got like four different portions of the foot sure you got heel sure more in the arch M the ball of the foot and the toes from this", "start": 412.039, "duration": 19.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "north south Direction yep set up for us and you have almost 100% of your pressure on the toes so it be as far north as you could get so not this way", "start": 420.8, "duration": 17.799}
{"chunk": "just over how you're going to get there is like you're just falling over it's almost like if you had a pool in front of you and you're ready to like dive in", "start": 430.479, "duration": 15.401999999999997}
{"chunk": "there that way just that look looks okay it's a little overdone this way sure but now try to drop I got", "start": 437.36, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "so much so much room to yes exactly so coming from more of a toe bias I can actually now afford to move", "start": 447.84, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "more that way transition which is what we want which is what we want that's our preference in our system okay okay so we'll just call this diving board", "start": 455.639, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "posture okay in that like if we're standing right exactly so if I'm getting ready to just jump in I'm going to go this way that's see I'm like heavy into", "start": 464.96, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "the balls of my feet or into the toes this is okay this is okay you can drop it back into the balls of the feet and it's super subtle this is just what we", "start": 473.96, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "want to like stay away from when we're setting up interesting okay we want to move there in the golf swing yep okay yep the final bit is just this like we", "start": 483.12, "duration": 18.519}
{"chunk": "hear a lot about this this anterior versus uh posterior pelvic tilt okay so show anterior tilt so anterior tilts", "start": 492.159, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "that way exactly so if you could think of and you just said this before making this video like Fishbowl like if you can imagine your pelvis is a fishbowl okay", "start": 501.12, "duration": 18.439}
{"chunk": "and we wanted to Spill the water out forward like out of my belt buckle my pelvis would been this way so that's extension in the L spine so my pelvises", "start": 510.0, "duration": 20.241}
{"chunk": "went there exactly exactly okay or if you went posterior pelvic tilt we're we're trying to pour that water out the", "start": 519.44, "duration": 15.359}
{"chunk": "other direction okay and all that we're doing like you'll see it's very subtle it's just in my belt line here anterior", "start": 527.959, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "tilt posterior tilt okay we want to go and move more into a posterior bias Okay the reason", "start": 535.56, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "that we're doing this is we're moving everything like all of that makes us go into more of a flexion state in the entire spine so if we go heavy", "start": 544.48, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "protraction here in the scaps t-spine flexion now show posterior pelvic tilt there's L spine flexion so TJ's entire", "start": 554.2, "duration": 19.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "spine looks more rounded this way and why we're doing that is we're almost presetting", "start": 564.079, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "impact okay so we're going to get back like if you look at every really highle like hitter on tour they're all in this like pretty heavy fle flexion State they", "start": 571.519, "duration": 19.042}
{"chunk": "look more that way at the moment of the strike as opposed to as opposed to that way exactly exactly so we're kind of in", "start": 581.12, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "a way presetting impact okay at setup in the spine got it okay there you go beautiful so the other thing that we're", "start": 588.88, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "going to do like throughout the course of the the movement here like the arms are going to lift at some point like if you fire them what's that make your spine do does it go into more of a", "start": 598.36, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "flexion state or more of an extension State I mean the more that I lift them the more they're going to extend that's exactly right and if you toss the arms", "start": 607.12, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "and then dropped now it's full extension full extension full extension okay and it's not because I'm trying to go into spine", "start": 615.44, "duration": 15.639000000000001}
{"chunk": "extension it's because the act of squatting like dropping properly y makes my like my whole back chain my spine go", "start": 623.04, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "into more extension there you go and and the t-spine goes into more extension because the arms are lifting if the arms left I", "start": 630.72, "duration": 18.361000000000004}
{"chunk": "look more this way so this is extension and if I drop I'm going into a bit more extension all right so actually the back swing those those forces are pulling the", "start": 639.88, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "spine into some extension yes so if we set up already extended you don't have room we don't have that ability exactly so what you've done is you", "start": 647.92, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "subtracted your ability to go into extension because you're already there it's like if I'm driving long and I'm in second gear and the passenger goes shift", "start": 657.44, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "to second gear you have no no you can't move yeah yeah yeah so it immobilizes you it doesn't allow you to move in certain", "start": 665.8, "duration": 16.160000000000004}
{"chunk": "ways all right fair enough and in that like that transitionary period like you'll see this out of like all our favorites like havland look at havland", "start": 674.16, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "in freaking like p 3 to P5 watch his spine it's like it's going to go from", "start": 681.76, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "some extension to fle so he sets up in quite a bit of this like he looks this way set up he and then from like look at his spine here and look at his spine at", "start": 689.36, "duration": 19.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "P5 ah interesting big drop the arms lift so we're setting up in a way that makes that fraking possible sure like that we", "start": 698.2, "duration": 18.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "we need that sure so like so like havlin doing this is intentional right cuz now he's got some Mobility to actually", "start": 707.959, "duration": 17.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "move yep yep so if I if if I'm in this like heavy like flexion State here and then I go movement drop yep there's the", "start": 716.76, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "spine extension that we want the appropr that's such a good look so let's do this now cuz and and go ahead and set up and I'll just like recap here CU we got", "start": 724.92, "duration": 19.48}
{"chunk": "three main topics I want to see like almost to the threshold of of um scat protraction it's going to make this", "start": 733.68, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "round more for you got it okay let's make sure that we're in quite a bit of pelvic posterior tilt good so loads of drop", "start": 742.639, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "there and then move away from it more so you can be in more diving board posture so you're more into the toes okay now you look like freaking hbling holy cow", "start": 752.839, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "that doesn't that doesn't look like what it feels like yeah okay so now go ahead and hit one with plenty of drop in that transitionary phase and just flush one", "start": 762.44, "duration": 18.279000000000003}
{"chunk": "out for us super cool really cool so again we want to two things in in in setting up we want the ability to move in certain", "start": 771.12, "duration": 20.12}
{"chunk": "ways so that I can shift from second to third gear go figure um and we also want the ability to like subtract all the", "start": 784.0, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "stuff that we don't want to do I don't want to start in the heels and then have no ability to move in the heels sure I have all the ability in the world to move into the toes because of pelvic", "start": 792.839, "duration": 19.001}

{"chunk": "just again ey test you're like that one looks better than that one just from an athletic perspective screw plane who cares about where the golf club swinging", "start": 811.68, "duration": 15.479999999999999}
{"chunk": "just look at people move and if you do that like your eye test on the driving range if you just put like next time you go to the range just put your bag down", "start": 819.24, "duration": 17.281}

{"chunk": "right yeah yeah okay so set up properly just through those three basic principles it will allow you to move one in a really healthy way but you'll also", "start": 863.36, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "be able to like swing the fraking golf club and it feels nice and you can do the things that you have always wanted to do in your golf swing just based on", "start": 873.16, "duration": 16.358999999999998}
