{"chunk": "is have this up on our screen at the same time here. And what you'll notice is I I've got this whole like our our", "start": 141.4, "duration": 16.12}

{"chunk": "custom practice for me. set up new practice. Continue. Continue. And then we're in here. So, what's really cool,", "start": 158.319, "duration": 15.721}

{"chunk": "actually get into your your practice now, you're going to have all of these various readings from flexion to extension states, er to radial deviation", "start": 175.36, "duration": 19.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "and rotation um of the of the club through the hit, which is really really awesome feedback. And the other thing that's really cool here we might look at", "start": 185.12, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "um later on is is what's called timing. And it's really just understanding this idea of the ratio of your away swing to", "start": 193.44, "duration": 17.519}

{"chunk": "on flexion and extension um and uh radial and er throughout the course of the swing. And in particular, we'll really highlight this flexion to", "start": 244.08, "duration": 16.639000000000003}
{"chunk": "extension state throughout the course of the swing. And we get these questions a freaking ton when we swing when when", "start": 253.439, "duration": 18.561}

{"chunk": "hey, what is the grip supposed to be and what am I supposed to be doing up at the top? because we see a lot of this like bow out state for some players and then", "start": 270.479, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "other players like Rory, there's not nearly as much bow. There's actually a little bit more cup at the top. And so it becomes like massively confusing", "start": 279.199, "duration": 15.041}

{"chunk": "necessarily a right and a wrong um in golf swings. It just depends on what you are needing out of the ball. That's the", "start": 295.12, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "most important thing. And before we really like dive in here, if we look at like the LPGA tour compared to the PGA", "start": 304.32, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "Tour in general, what we are seeing is a little bit of a difference in what's going on in this, especially in this transitionary space. You'll see a lot of", "start": 312.28, "duration": 18.761}
{"chunk": "players on the PGA Tour have a heck of a lot more flexion state, which we call bow, at the top of their swing, compared", "start": 322.24, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "to the LPGA tour. Now, that is not across the board, but that is a tendency. And I I would really urge you to take a look at the LPGA tour and find", "start": 329.68, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "anybody out there that has bow or flexion state at the top of their swing. If you find some, definitely send them over because I would love to take a look", "start": 339.84, "duration": 17.039}

{"chunk": "affect the rest of the swing, especially the hit? So, if I go ahead and just hit a few here, just to go ahead and take a look at what readings would would uh", "start": 367.6, "duration": 22.52}
{"chunk": "show and hack, you'll see here immediately, and this is kind of neat because I'm throwing a whole bunch of of greens here, which is kind of fun, but", "start": 378.24, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "we've got the address position, the top, and impact when it comes to the flexion or extension state here. And what that's showing, if we have a plus in any one of", "start": 387.84, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "those categories, that is an extension state in the wrist. And if we have a negative in any one of those categories, we have a flexion state. And then if you", "start": 396.96, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "look down here below, right underneath the flexion and extension, we've got er versus radial deviation. What er and radial is is more looking at what's", "start": 405.68, "duration": 20.64}
{"chunk": "going on in the wrist when it comes to hinging the golf club more vertically here. So, I I always think of this as like h a hammer exercise. If I was", "start": 415.68, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "holding on to a hammer and I loaded the hammer, I'm going to move into more of a radial state. If I unload the hammer, I'm moving more into an ulner state.", "start": 424.08, "duration": 17.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "Now, at the end of the day, what we're going to see, and you'll see this at the address position compared to the top compared to impact, we start in an", "start": 433.199, "duration": 18.562}
{"chunk": "amount of ner. Every single player on Earth is going to start an er at a dress and every single player on Earth is going to work into some amount of radial", "start": 442.4, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "at the top. Everybody's a little bit different here and we'll discuss why as we motor through this in this particular video. As I'm talking about this, this", "start": 451.36, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "video could take freaking six hours. We could get so deep into a lot of these categories and the combinations of all of these various movements. Okay? And", "start": 460.0, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "then when we get back into into impact, we go back into er again for a number of different reasons. Now, one of the the characteristics that's kind of a stock", "start": 468.24, "duration": 20.119}
{"chunk": "swing for me, you'll notice that I start if we go back to flexion and extension at an address position of plus", "start": 477.879, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "24. If we just look at the grip to start with here, the stronger my grip, so let's say I'm I'm I'm Matthew Fitzpatrick. See how the emblem is", "start": 486.36, "duration": 17.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "almost pointing out towards the camera? Look at the state of extension here when I start, I'm up in the plus 30 category.", "start": 495.919, "duration": 17.682}
{"chunk": "The weaker that I go this way, which is going to be more and more supenation of the lead arm or lead hand, you'll see that now I I I supenate more. But what", "start": 504.24, "duration": 21.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "that leads to is way less extension. So, you're going to almost have a neutral state here if you're weak like Morawa compared to Rory or Fitzpatrick who", "start": 514.56, "duration": 18.4}
{"chunk": "gripped the golf club a heck of a lot stronger. Now, typically, not always, but typically what we will see is if we have", "start": 525.2, "duration": 19.12}
{"chunk": "a player that's weaker in the grip, what they are going to need is a heck of a lot more flexion state at the top to manage the face.", "start": 534.16, "duration": 17.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "And the me the reason for this is if I'm if I'm extremely strong here Sam Fitzpatrick and now at the top I bow", "start": 542.8, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "this look at the amount of rotation that I'm going to have in the face and all of a sudden the face almost becomes like out of bounds when it comes to how", "start": 551.6, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "strong the face would be. It'd be too closed up here up here for me to be able to manage that down at the bottom. Now that's not 100% of the time because we", "start": 559.68, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "see that category a bit with DJ. That's why DJ's club face gets so strong at the top because he almost doubles it up.", "start": 568.16, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "Now, it allows him to have a very stable hit through the strike because if I've got it doubled up with strength, because if I grip it this way, meaning pronated", "start": 577.36, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "at the start, a bit more extension, so strong grip, and then I go up here and I bow this and I move into more extension, I've just doubled up the strength of the", "start": 586.16, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "club. So what I would have to do through the strike is unload the golf club almost exclusively with an extension or excuse me a flexion to extension pattern", "start": 595.2, "duration": 19.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "through the strike which is a very very low rate of rotation in the club face through the hit when we're unloading the club. That is a type of release. Whereas", "start": 604.8, "duration": 21.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "with a Rory type pattern he has a bit of a strong state in this in this grip and at the top he'll throw more radial. So,", "start": 614.959, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "it keeps this extension state kind of like my last one did. And the toe kind of droops, but the golf club is in a pretty neutral state up here at the top.", "start": 624.48, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "So, as he changes direction and now releases, he's going to have more rotation in his arms to go ahead and", "start": 632.48, "duration": 15.559000000000001}
{"chunk": "square the club. Now, is that a bad thing? No, not at all. And again, like, yeah, can we argue, especially now", "start": 639.839, "duration": 20.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "Rory's hi history when it comes to what he's done in his golf career, he's an incredibly high level player, former world number one Grand", "start": 649.72, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "Slam champion, will probably be number one player in the world again at some point. But then we're disc describing DJ, who is also a former number one", "start": 659.44, "duration": 19.999}
{"chunk": "player in the world. So looking at these two athletes and going, \"Well, that one's right and this one's wrong.\" is is a bit my opinion", "start": 669.519, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "naive. Instead, what we should look at is why does DJ's pattern work and why does Rory's pattern work? That's a", "start": 677.64, "duration": 18.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "better question. And then from taking that that understanding of both of those types of athletes, you can start to", "start": 686.88, "duration": 16.36}
{"chunk": "understand what type of hand action, what type of grip in your golf swing is going to suit you best. So, let's start", "start": 695.0, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "going down this. Let's take a look at we'll start with the LPGA tour. So, female female players. Now, this is just a blanket", "start": 703.2, "duration": 18.48}

{"chunk": "Okay, so men's game versus women's game. What you'll see most of the time is a fairly neutral grip. And at at the top,", "start": 721.839, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "what we will have is a golf club that loads mostly through radial. And I keep some amount of extension. And from here,", "start": 729.519, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "what players will do is they'll lower the arms and almost adduct this lead arm as they're working into delivery. So the face stays fairly neutral. It's", "start": 737.68, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "definitely not strong here. So the leading edge almost sticks straight up and down. And now through the hit, as they rotate their body, what they'll do", "start": 746.24, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "is they'll tend to rotate the upper arms and the forearms through the strike. So we will see a pattern that looks", "start": 753.92, "duration": 18.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "more in that type of a range. Now when we look at this, I started at plus 23 at the top. I had plus 26. So still", "start": 762.279, "duration": 18.361}
{"chunk": "plenty of extension, almost the exact same amount extension um at the top. and then through the hit. As I go from a", "start": 772.48, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "more pronated state, which is also an internal state with this lead humorris, and work through the strike, as I supenate, what ends up happening, and", "start": 780.16, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "you'll see this in the reading right now, I have minus 11 in flection, meaning that I've gone from a a bit of a cup state to a bit of a bode state", "start": 789.2, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "through the hit. You will see that type of a pattern on the LPGA Tour almost exclusively. Now, on the PGA Tour,", "start": 798.32, "duration": 16.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "you'll still see some of that. You see that in Rory, you see that in a player like Jimmy Walker, Web Simpson, any one of those players who have more of a", "start": 806.8, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "neutral state here, meaning from the start to the top, we almost maintain that same amount of extension. But then", "start": 816.079, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "there's other players like Havlin, DJ, Kepka, these types of players. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with just a neutral type grip here.", "start": 823.12, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "Okay? So, I'm not going to go weak and I'm not going to go strong. I'm just going to be relatively neutral just to define that a bit further. The crease from your lead carpal bone and the", "start": 832.48, "duration": 20.559}
{"chunk": "thumb, this line right here points over towards my trail clavicle or my right shoulder complex. If it points outside of that, that's leaning into strong a", "start": 842.0, "duration": 18.56}

{"chunk": "what I'm going to show here is a heck of a lot more flexion state. You'll see how much stronger the face is at the top and what those readings will", "start": 860.079, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "show. Okay. So now I went from plus 23 at a dress. At the top I went to minus1. Okay, which is a heck of a lot", "start": 870.6, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "stronger there. And then at impact I'm at minus4. So what's interesting is I'm going from a a a stronger position here with", "start": 881.44, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "more flexion state in the wrist and then to get into the strike I almost maintain that same amount of flexion state by the time I'm at the strike. Now what we will", "start": 890.16, "duration": 20.0}

{"chunk": "the ground. P9 is where the trail arm gets level to the ground. we would actually move more into an extension state there with the with the release of", "start": 908.399, "duration": 16.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "the club. And so what we'll see is a difference between neutral be meaning that we're at", "start": 916.0, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "whatever the last number was plus 23. I'm roughly at plus 23 at the top. So all I've done to load the club is worked into a radial load. If you're my target,", "start": 925.68, "duration": 18.878}
{"chunk": "what we're going to see is a release pattern that looks more like this. See how the toe starts to flash over? I'm gonna throw more supenation in the lead hand to go ahead and square that golf", "start": 935.279, "duration": 20.001}
{"chunk": "club compared to me starting at relatively neutral plus 23ish. And when I get to the top, I go", "start": 944.639, "duration": 16.039}
{"chunk": "to zero or negative one like the last rep. If I do that and work back through the strike, the way that I'm going to manage the club is more from a flexion", "start": 952.959, "duration": 19.561}

{"chunk": "question is, what is going to suit me better? If you're the athlete going, well, which pattern is right for", "start": 971.279, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "me? Let's take a look at what we're look what we're going to find again on the LPGA Tour. LPGA Tour Ball Flight is", "start": 979.88, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "typically a block. So the ball starts slightly right of their alignment target block draw that's medium", "start": 988.6, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
{"chunk": "height. So, we won't see like things that you won't see on the LPJ tour, primarily cut style patterns. Doesn't mean that they can't cut it. It just", "start": 996.199, "duration": 18.602}
{"chunk": "means that their neutral or stock ball is a a bit more of a block draw. We'll also see higher and mid-flight patterns", "start": 1006.16, "duration": 16.718}
{"chunk": "out there on the LPGA Tour compared to the PGA Tour. Let's take Havland as a really great example. Havlin for a", "start": 1014.079, "duration": 18.8}

{"chunk": "managing the release from a lead wrist flexion to extension state is because it lowers the rate of rotation in the club", "start": 1104.96, "duration": 17.759}
