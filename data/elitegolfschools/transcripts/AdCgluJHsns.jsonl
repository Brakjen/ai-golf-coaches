{"chunk": "well day in and day out they both strike it really well exactly but probably John ROM right I mean yeah I mean if you're looking at like overall man it's just an", "start": 95.68, "duration": 19.520000000000003}

{"chunk": "and I go with the arms it shoots the energy out like I'd shoot the water out of it okay so I get I get the energy in the club head going which direction now down", "start": 235.799, "duration": 20.561}
{"chunk": "downward M so I've got to stop and extend there you go ah so if the club goes down you got to move up uhhuh so and you won't see anybody that just does", "start": 245.04, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "this they're just going to start actively rotating the pelvis this will stall a bit now I can rotate the golf club and we see that out of players that", "start": 254.48, "duration": 16.639}

{"chunk": "delivery good so that face is shut so we'll see like and how TJ's doing this is primarily flexion of the wrist compared to extension of the wrist if", "start": 348.72, "duration": 15.000000000000002}
{"chunk": "you just show extension that face flashes open f flexion face is shut so now from here if you stay in hip flexion", "start": 356.8, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "and turn he can square the face now because it was shut yeah with the chest which is", "start": 364.68, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "interesting because most players that cut the golf ball shut it are shut at delivery and I think a lot of people watching this are going to just realize", "start": 373.199, "duration": 16.560000000000002}

{"chunk": "little bit more closure I need a little bit more more like softening here to open the face dependent upon like how I want to work through here and dependent", "start": 417.759, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "upon the ball flight sure okay so again reviewing if we're hitting if we're seeing like heavier rate of rotation", "start": 424.52, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "we're probably seeing more vertical athletes and we're seeing athletes that get the golf club in more of an open position at P5 right okay so if you're", "start": 434.319, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "wanting to work into again do do we have preferences of course we have preferences like would mostly be the", "start": 441.84, "duration": 19.358999999999998}

{"chunk": "see the face pointing back I'm like finally let's go all Juiced up but look like one we're golf coaches sure so", "start": 459.52, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "we're messing with stuff all the time all the time always tinkering so always tinkering the other thing is just", "start": 468.44, "duration": 15.558}
{"chunk": "like if you are going to master your golf swing mhm you better understand systems at a really really high level", "start": 475.319, "duration": 17.082}
{"chunk": "totally so if I want to move into low rate of rotation what are what's what's the what are the movements", "start": 483.68, "duration": 15.839}
{"chunk": "that I need to have where do I need the golf club organized in delivery all of these things go into this like really really important Okay and like what", "start": 492.68, "duration": 20.68}
{"chunk": "we're doing actively with the hands and what we're doing passively with the hands is vitally important low rate of rot is a passive response to good", "start": 502.759, "duration": 20.001}
{"chunk": "movement and what we're doing in the arm system and the Hand system way earlier than the hit mhm okay so let's go into", "start": 512.8, "duration": 19.719}
{"chunk": "um POS uh P3 okay P3 okay so from here what we'll see out", "start": 522.519, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "of good movers okay um or or just not necessarily good movers but like good golfers in general is as the golf club's working up we're going to see a change", "start": 532.08, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "in Direction with the body so let's see here this isn't our preference but let's see a player that rotates the pelvis from here good to go ahead and sequence", "start": 542.0, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "this out TJ's going to show shoulder extension to get the golf club deeper here so the shaft is a lot taller okay", "start": 551.8, "duration": 15.159}
{"chunk": "that's how we're going to organize so we would see a little bit of like probably adduction into here and and shoulder extension to get the golf club into kind", "start": 559.959, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "of a hitable position with pelvic active pelvic rotation I see okay so the forces are going yes exactly and that's heavily", "start": 567.519, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "overdone but from there like go ahead and do that again boom now if you kept turning the pelvis and now fired the arms let's see", "start": 575.519, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "how the golf club reacts and response we would see that okay so Juniors and not", "start": 583.36, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "all but a lot of players quite a few players in the LPGA Tour we'll see that shorter players not as not as massive of play of people people as well so we're", "start": 590.959, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "going to see that more than we're going to see on the PGA tour sure okay so let's go to three okay so that's heavier", "start": 600.36, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "RS of rotation in the club face okay now as the arms are going up we're going to show pelvic drop so hip", "start": 607.72, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "flexion good and as this is happening as well we want the club to get behind more so we'll see this lead arm ribs all look", "start": 616.48, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "to get the golf club in this position here mhm roughly okay so the golf club's out so where are the forces going so if we go back to", "start": 624.6, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "three okay here we go you're in charge of drop so the forces are going with the golf club mhm now we need to understand", "start": 632.92, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "what we're doing in here in the rest the Active Release would be Trail wrist supination and it's supination because", "start": 640.6, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "we have so much extension in this Trail wrist but the supination would make the golf club look like it just continues to seek the ground see how the forces are going in the same direction here good", "start": 649.92, "duration": 20.119}
{"chunk": "but I keep that extension as you're suating turn the chest there we go so now we're getting ready to get into the strike and from", "start": 659.519, "duration": 18.721}
{"chunk": "here if you kept turning eventually the energy washes out of the wrist and the passive release is extension keep", "start": 668.68, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "turning the chest to flexion look at that face dead Square uhhuh yep so Active", "start": 676.56, "duration": 20.32}
{"chunk": "Release once you get into five is supination with chest rotation there's the active the passive because there's energy stored in here and you're going", "start": 686.48, "duration": 17.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "to keep turning the chest there's the passive release here okay lot going on there but a ton", "start": 695.56, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "going on but we've got to understand all of that sure like how does that all work where am I putting forces we need the forces to keep going behind me and down", "start": 704.519, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "cuz we'll see guys that get into five and then just screw it up because they're trying to square it and their old pattern and totally screw up the strike mhm but I'm in here I need this", "start": 714.8, "duration": 20.121}
{"chunk": "to be the main engine but if I shut this off the golf club just stays high oh that's interesting right so we if I just turn it just stay level see how this", "start": 724.48, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "just stays level around TJ so you'd miss the golf ball by 3 ft so this you got to keep itation helps you get it down there", "start": 733.6, "duration": 16.598}
{"chunk": "it is yep uhhuh okay so let's see two patterns let's see and this can be super slow to you don't need to go hard at it", "start": 740.279, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "but let's see a really low rate of rotation first okay okay in the face because of how you're getting into five and then from five how am I going", "start": 750.839, "duration": 18.642}
{"chunk": "through here to here all right to slow down the rate of rotation low rate of rotation first y you can show a little mocker first if you want", "start": 760.12, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "boom boom there we go and just pitchy out there but you're just playing with match ups and movement there we go", "start": 768.76, "duration": 16.277}
{"chunk": "beautiful okay now let's see high rate of rotation so we're going to throw more active", "start": 779.76, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "pelvic and we're going to let this go into more extension as this works by the chest there we go and now how would you", "start": 788.04, "duration": 17.838}
{"chunk": "unload it there you go just a chippy one as well there you go okay now you you've been working your", "start": 799.04, "duration": 17.477}
{"chunk": "butt off on one pattern for sure but you're also big strong studly man so lots of mass sure so it's it's you can", "start": 809.56, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "have a ton of transmission of energy through rotation and slow down the rate of rotation in the face okay that's freaking awesome but you have close to", "start": 818.88, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "180 ball speed sure okay well the ball speed on the LPGA Tour is not even close to that it's it's like 140 I believe so the ball's just not in the air long", "start": 826.839, "duration": 18.922}
{"chunk": "enough plus like when I'm releasing it here mhm I'm getting energy out into the ball this way boom I can launch it higher I can draw it easier mhm you see", "start": 836.44, "duration": 21.0}
{"chunk": "that a ton on the LPGA Tour drivers of the golf ball on the LPGA Tour typically draw pattern drivers on the on the PGA", "start": 846.72, "duration": 15.518999999999998}

{"chunk": "not seeing Juniors get injured because one they're pliable to they don't have as much mass so we don't have as much energy in in individual joint complexes", "start": 873.36, "duration": 17.317999999999998}

{"chunk": "again systems have bookins so what we're looking to do is like knock people through this wall to understand like okay I feel stuff now once you're in", "start": 917.279, "duration": 19.641}
{"chunk": "five Y which is drop primarily ribs to get the golf club leveled out back here but you'll notice how that affects this lead arm like it works away you see a", "start": 926.519, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "lot of space there that helps to get the center mass of the golf club down there you go and what tej is showing right there is continuing the forces here", "start": 935.92, "duration": 17.399}

{"chunk": "actively trying to move this way it only works if we've got the other parts of the system there yeah your body's got to be moving in the way that supports that otherwise that's just going to feel", "start": 962.639, "duration": 17.921}

{"chunk": "system's got to support that action if you got one piece of it it just ain't going to feel right that's exactly right so let's see one more here okay so we understand how we're getting into five", "start": 979.8, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "how you keep the forces of the golf club working in the same direction as you turn on it and the release will just happen on its", "start": 988.639, "duration": 15.119}

{"chunk": "that just sound right like echoed it's still hissing know the system to release it", "start": 1003.399, "duration": 17.16}
