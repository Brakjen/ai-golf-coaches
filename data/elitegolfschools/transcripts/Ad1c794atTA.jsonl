{"chunk": "okay Max today we're talking about takeaway the importance and how to set up your swing to hit some flushers let's do it let's do", "start": 0.08, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "it so today we're talking about takeaway there's a lot to go into this small fraction of the Swing if you will but I", "start": 12.32, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "mean the takeaway is important because it's going to set you up for the rest of the Swing so I think first I'd love to hear your thoughts on the importance of", "start": 21.439, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "the takeaway and then we'll dive into everything that goes into it yeah I think you kind of hit the nail on the head um the way that I kind of view takeaway is more or less just like if we", "start": 30.8, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "can kind of nail the takeaway the rest of the golf swing just kind of is able to happen yeah and we don't really have to try to do anything you know kind of funky in transition or in the in the", "start": 39.32, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "downswing so right yeah and real quick if you set up uh to the camera face on yep I think to help people understand at least what we would view as takeaway if", "start": 48.32, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "you know the PE system it's going to be about P2 two and a half so that's when shaft is at parallel and maybe just a fraction pass anywhere in here is going", "start": 57.6, "duration": 19.239}
{"chunk": "to be what we'd consider the takeway and again like Max said that's setting up the swing because from there it's just that Snowball Effect yep so talking", "start": 67.119, "duration": 16.642000000000003}
{"chunk": "about takeaway what does the body do I would say to start the swing right we talk about the upper spiral or you can think", "start": 75.56, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "of the upper body is what's going to initiate that takeaway one thing I'll see a lot with people is if you were to set up down the line here one fault I'll", "start": 83.84, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "see a lot of golfers do is you hear I got to get open I got to get deep so you see the trail pelvis pull back and what's that going to do it's going to", "start": 93.24, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "suck the club inside hands go immediately inside yeah then what's the rebound as you work through in the down s kind of gets a little deep and then what we'll see is like then it gets a", "start": 100.479, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "little steep over the top once we get that swipe Miss you'll tend to see a lot of that kind of tilt picture where the club face is open right or sometimes", "start": 109.399, "duration": 15.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "we'll flip it when we tilt all kind of comes from that like takeway that's a little bit too far inside yeah so you hear what I got to get the body open that would be what we'd consider a wrong", "start": 117.2, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "way to go about that so something we prefer to see is that upper spiral on that trail side starting to pull you up", "start": 126.64, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "back and away and for us that's feeling like the chest you hear us talk about the chest takes it away or the upper body takes it away yep and I think a big thing too when we do this is feeling", "start": 134.519, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "like we almost have a stretch from like so my left hip pocket almost to like my right kind of shoulder there's going to be quite a stretch across my uh like", "start": 144.239, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "across my core here yeah so lead hip Trail shoulder and you're just trying to pull on that rubber band or pull on that create some tension go ahead and show me", "start": 152.319, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "that a couple times of yeah down the line so it's going to be here where chest moves it and then I stretch and", "start": 159.72, "duration": 16.039}
{"chunk": "let my hips go so if I do this face on you can kind of see yeah and honestly a good drill for doing this is putting the club across your chest and going stretch", "start": 168.319, "duration": 15.481000000000002}
{"chunk": "there so you can see that kind of spiral start to work and then as I keep mov moving now the hips are now engaged but they're not sucked way behind me yeah", "start": 176.28, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "I'm just creating a little bit more stretch that way I can let that spiral go on the through swing do that again from face on where you you do that first", "start": 184.519, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "half what we'd consider the takeway right about P2 so stretch that band and look how quiet", "start": 191.84, "duration": 17.361}
{"chunk": "that trail pelvis is in relation to the chest right you can tell the chest or the spirals doing the majority of the pulling as you keep working up we're now", "start": 199.72, "duration": 15.559000000000001}
{"chunk": "going to see okay there's a little more pelvis engagement to get open but you didn't start with the pelvis we started with the chest or the upper spot yeah", "start": 208.12, "duration": 17.321}
{"chunk": "and I think mean kind of making sure that the that the pelvis responds to what the upper body is doing is super super key to feeling that I love that so", "start": 216.92, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "you know in our opinion or our preference is the upper spiral or the chest is what's going to initiate that's what we would consider that's what the", "start": 224.959, "duration": 15.922}
{"chunk": "body does yes so now talking about well what do the arms do and even what do the hands do to play their part as it relates to takeaway and I think specifically for people at home the", "start": 232.48, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "center of mass right so just quick education on that again it's generally where the club's going to balance so wherever this Center of mass is in space", "start": 241.959, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "is going to dictate where's that club going and how it affects the rest of the golf exactly so I think first and foremost with the hands we get the hands", "start": 250.079, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "to actually kind of control where the center of mass is and you know at the same time we get Club face stability as well yeah you need both of those work so", "start": 259.04, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "if I make this picture here we're down the line and I like roll my hands over which we see quite a bit too yes that club face is wide open now and then", "start": 268.16, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "we'll look at the center of masses it's behind behind me and even under in relation to your hand so somehow you got to get that club which is where you'll", "start": 275.84, "duration": 16.039}
{"chunk": "see the arm start to fire up when look at it does to your wrist now you got this extremely cuffed wrist extremely open at the top we got to compensate somewhere else now yep and it usually", "start": 283.68, "duration": 17.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "comes from like that picture there get a little bit steep over the top so the arms will fire down and then again the body is responding to the arms not the arms responding to what the body's doing", "start": 292.36, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "correct let's see um even a common one you see is you know like these days Dustin Johnson or more call you want the club face shut you want a bod wrist", "start": 301.72, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "often times there will be Overkill and that club face is extremely shut and now we got to find a way to compensate", "start": 310.639, "duration": 15.042}
{"chunk": "correct exactly so for the arms the arms are there to support the club but it's going to be the wrists again we're talking takeaway y it's going to be the", "start": 317.6, "duration": 18.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "wrists that are starting to pitch that Center a mass or pitch that club in the fashion we want so go ahead and set up", "start": 327.759, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "no golf ball yet but if we were going to make a sequence out of this number one would be upper spiral to start the", "start": 335.52, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "takeaway number two you just did it right there that's perfect the wrists or the hands start to kick the center Mass up and somewhere from this P2 working", "start": 343.039, "duration": 21.241}
{"chunk": "our way into P3 P4 the arms start to then go up and now you have that nice takeaway that leaks into a really good back swing yep so the sequence would be", "start": 352.88, "duration": 20.72}
{"chunk": "upper spiral wrists arm supporting as we work it up to the top yep I love that so just some quick hand education what", "start": 363.28, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "we're trying to do with this club there's a couple ways we can move the center of mass and the club itself so number one is radial deviation so you", "start": 372.0, "duration": 17.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "can think of that as thumbs up or if you had the club head you're trying to get the club head above your hands it's just in the wrist kicking that club head up", "start": 380.36, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "now like Max is starting to demonstrate what do we do when the club head gets below my hands that's considered older deviation or you can think thumbs down", "start": 389.4, "duration": 15.639999999999999}
{"chunk": "and again that kicks the club head below my hands yep the next one we have is wrist flexion and wrist extension so wrist extension if it's your Trail", "start": 396.84, "duration": 21.478}
{"chunk": "arm you can think Palm towards the camera or you can think how do we move the club head to the right and you can", "start": 406.919, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "see there the club face stays relatively passive that's how we keep the club face Square now if we release the club or", "start": 415.479, "duration": 15.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "throw the club that is Trail wrist flexion and it'd be the opposite right for your lead so this would be flexion", "start": 422.84, "duration": 16.201}
{"chunk": "on the lead hand this would be extension on the way through and the last one Max touched on this a little bit is rolling the face inside that is what we call", "start": 430.96, "duration": 20.0}
{"chunk": "suating of the trail alarm and pronating of the lead you can see there's that CED wrist again that we don't like to see that wide open Club face if you have any", "start": 441.0, "duration": 17.799}
{"chunk": "bit of rolling the face or rolling those forearms you see a lot of face flashing through the strike to try and square be a result of like pronating that trail", "start": 450.16, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "wrist through the strik you're can see that that trail forearm get over the lead forearm yes so now we're going to talk about what we'd like to see", "start": 459.319, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "preference wise first and then some cures for every everything else we see going on so if you were going to hit a golf ball here and we'll even Tee It Up", "start": 467.84, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "I think when we're talking about drills and talking about fields I prefer something off of te so it's viewed as a workstation rather than oh", "start": 476.52, "duration": 15.439}
{"chunk": "I'm trying to hit golf balls flush I'd absolutely agree so I think biggest thing that that we kind of view as a preference would Club head just slightly", "start": 484.28, "duration": 17.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "outside the hands if not on the hands yes we tend to see this quite a bit this is probably something we don't prefer quite as much want to stay away from that yeah I mean there are good players", "start": 492.84, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "that can do this from here but I think we found more success if we can kind of live in this Zone here that club head is just either on the hands or just outside", "start": 501.96, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "the hands it allows the club to work a little bit more efficiently through the golf ball and the other thing I think to point out too go back to that same spot yeah we want that right Club head", "start": 510.0, "duration": 17.279000000000003}
{"chunk": "slightly in front or even online with this Leading Edge matching your spine angle y all right Trev so show me this kind of drill that that we can do to", "start": 518.56, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "help kind of get into that Preferred Risk condition for the takeaway 100% so just set up to the golf ball and to keep it simple goal number one get the club", "start": 527.519, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "head above your hands without turning or lifting those arms okay so that means we got to go into some radial deviation good see that club head is in", "start": 536.24, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "line or above his hands now without turning or anything going on we got to move the club head over to his Trail side so now we're talking about some", "start": 544.92, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "radial deviation we're talking about some trail wrist extension and now he's in that takeaway spot so just rehearsing", "start": 553.8, "duration": 15.961}
{"chunk": "that a couple times to go that's the place I want to end up in so above the hands to the right that's what we're trying to feel and now he can make yeah", "start": 561.36, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "that little loopy almost like a little half circle yes beautiful and then when he's ready to go", "start": 571.32, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "he can start to work on upper spiral that sequence we talked about if he can take it away to that spot so go ahead and show us", "start": 578.32, "duration": 15.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "one awesome and again that just put you in a really good spot of if I can get to this takeaway position if you will", "start": 588.72, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "that's going to set me up for success and we're going to stay away from position because it's a dynamic spot you're only moving through here in a split second but if you start to really", "start": 596.88, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "nail okay if I look at myself on camera and I'm moving through that spot I know I'm setting myself up for Success yep well I noticed even just doing a drill", "start": 605.76, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "simple as that it's really really easy to get the middle of the club face to the back of the golf ball yeah you set those wrist structure your conditions are good to go now just let the body do", "start": 614.48, "duration": 15.639}
{"chunk": "its thing and you're set yourself up yeah the body just kind of responds to where the wrists are at 100% what's this contraption you got in my uh my hand here yeah so this one's great too just", "start": 622.2, "duration": 18.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "another way to incorporate good risk conditions good takeaway and turn it into a swing a little more Dynamic than the last one so that alignment six on", "start": 631.36, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "the outside of your grip it's on his lead side when he sets up to the golf ball big key here is you can see how much of a forward press that puts him in", "start": 639.12, "duration": 17.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "we're going to try and fight that a little bit and be as close to a standard setup as possible then from here he's going to see through radial deviation or", "start": 647.959, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "Club head above his hands how long can he slide that alignment stick down his leg and you can see how severe that", "start": 656.2, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "Center of mass starts to work up yeah that gets like vertical super super fast yeah and if we start to go incorrectly you're going to see how quickly this stick comes off and what I like about", "start": 664.68, "duration": 18.638}
{"chunk": "this is it gives you immediate feedback am I doing this right or not rather than let's hit a golf ball check the camera and it may be a wasted rep yep all right", "start": 674.079, "duration": 17.442}
{"chunk": "TR so as I'm starting to work this this stick down my lead leg here yeah at what point should I start to turn my body", "start": 682.56, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "I what point is like do I have enough Rd or radial deviation to get this club to start to turn behind me so if I was going to give you like a a definite spot", "start": 689.959, "duration": 17.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "I would say by the time that stick is starting to graze down your lead knee okay is a good time to start that sequence of upper spiral as we start to", "start": 699.36, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "work so if you want to just rehearse a couple takeaways yep slide it down start to queue up the takeaway and you start to find your flow y so if we were going", "start": 708.72, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "to do this in pieces to start just so the folks know what we're looking for slide it down to your knee that'll be Piece One Piece two is the upper spiral pulls", "start": 717.2, "duration": 19.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "it away and then piece three we're going to rotate chip it through okay and again you can do this in pieces and then you can start to blend it so I'll let you", "start": 727.0, "duration": 18.399}
{"chunk": "dictate you want to piece it or blend it yeah I'll piece it first here okay boom excellent okay Max what do you got as far as drills to help with takeaway", "start": 736.36, "duration": 17.802}
{"chunk": "yep so this is going to be more body oriented um takeaway things that we're going to do for drills um first one that I like it's super super simple", "start": 747.079, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "especially because I think we all have golf balls and we can do this on the driving range yeah so kind of helps you know get that takeaway a little bit more neutral a little bit more straight back", "start": 754.88, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "you know which will in turn if we feel straight back with the body the club head will tend to want to stay right on our hands maybe just outside our hands", "start": 763.079, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "just following along exactly so what I do is I'm going to have you set that club up right behind the golf ball okay and then I will put another golf ball here behind the Club head yeah and your", "start": 771.32, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "goal as a player is to push this club back or sorry push the golf ball back MH which will then you can already tell do that again for me", "start": 780.72, "duration": 19.198}
{"chunk": "yeah when we do that you push that ball back that ball is going to generally roll back towards the camera on a straight line and when you do this you", "start": 790.079, "duration": 15.161}
{"chunk": "have this picture of Club head outside the hands and you've done it all because you've moved your body you haven't really moved your hips or anything you haven't really even set your hands yet yes but you've just moved your body", "start": 797.92, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "straight back yes which keeps the club you know Square to the Target right now as well yes what I what I felt there was you know how long can I keep the back of", "start": 806.959, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "this club head on this ball and it wasn't in the sense of I have to move off this golf ball and reach to do it it's just how much can I turn and", "start": 816.32, "duration": 19.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "challenge that upper spiral to push Yep this ball away like it's going to come off at some point but like you said I've done this a couple times now and that", "start": 825.639, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "club head is outside my hands and the cool part is I haven't even added any radial just kicking this club head up which is when the arms can do their part", "start": 833.88, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "so it's a perfect way to nail the first two or three feet of this takeaway yep and I think the cool thing about this too is you can start to identify um you", "start": 842.36, "duration": 15.559000000000001}
{"chunk": "know what you do in the takeaway so if you're somebody that takes the the golf the golf club a little bit too far inside like that you're going to see the golf ball going towards your body well", "start": 850.959, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "look at these look at this you're caught in the act and look at the picture yeah exactly look at the picture that you get there probably going to see something like that correct now if you're somebody", "start": 859.399, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "that takes it too far away boom you're going to see this now the arms are super disconnected yeah I got some fle because you're kind of forcing the club head outside your hands and this is something", "start": 866.92, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "we'd consider probably a little bit too far outside your hands maybe a little bit quote I got route you got to make a huge kind of shape in the transition in the back swing to to get the club to", "start": 876.36, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "where we needed to go well and what I noticed right there too is I mean the the ball wasn't even on the club head that long so you can tell it's more up", "start": 885.079, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "than it is turn with the body it's a lot of arm and shoulder flexion than it is upper spir rotation when I when I do this drill kind of feeling like that club head is a brush and I'm trying to", "start": 893.68, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "brush that grass as long as I can transition I'm I'm going to allow my body which is turning away from the Target or away from this first golf ball", "start": 902.72, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "right to get the club up at some point right right some point you're going to turn far enough the club head's going to get up it's got to go up y push away get that golf ball to roll as straight back", "start": 911.16, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "as you can and then turn and hit it all right push away what you'll notice too is when you do that it almost feels like transition", "start": 920.12, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "and that kind of forward swing can just happen right it's like I set all the energy here yes and you can kind of play with that too if I want to throw the golf ball a little further what happens", "start": 928.72, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "to transition yes just super easy yes what I liked about that was transition was an afterthought and then I mean we", "start": 938.24, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "talk about floating like I felt like the club was just floating because I put all the focus in pushing the ball out yep", "start": 946.839, "duration": 15.56}
{"chunk": "rather than picking the club up exactly I think that's a great drill yep he's got the head cover out what are we doing now all right TR I'm going to put this right in your lead armpit it's going to", "start": 954.56, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "be right through here ex excellent okay just bear with me yeah now what so what this drill is good for is if you're somebody like myself who we have this", "start": 962.839, "duration": 16.041}
{"chunk": "tendency of we kind of get the arms a little bit disconnected boom head cover falls straight on the ground right yeah a lot of shoulder flexion going exactly", "start": 971.24, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "so we kind of make falsify this turn in the back swing by like letting the arms kind of go up and out yeah almost like a fake turn right turn and I'm very very", "start": 978.759, "duration": 18.441}
{"chunk": "guilty of doing this so what I do in order to avoid doing that is I throw that head cover right in my lead armpit yep and I keep it in there as long as I", "start": 988.0, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "can I'm pretty much only make like a nine to three swing when I do this yeah you can't really make a big turn with this no cuz at some point you're going to turn and then the arms are going to", "start": 997.16, "duration": 15.799}
{"chunk": "have to go up so you start to lose the but this is really kind of training that that good takeaway again we're not talking more than about the first three four feet of this go swing you know the", "start": 1004.36, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "club head's not moving very far but just feeling as if you're GNA keep that head cover pinched in between your left Peck", "start": 1013.88, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "and your uh your left arm there well look what it's doing to the center M it's keeping out in front of me again and again if you want to play with like for me like I personally add some Rd", "start": 1022.16, "duration": 18.281}
{"chunk": "that's okay because the arms responding yes and I I would imagine if I start to subate the trail pronate the lead if I", "start": 1031.12, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
