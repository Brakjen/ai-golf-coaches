{"chunk": "I'm going there there you go the turn is to sling the arms out got it you just fall", "start": 10.26, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "up there fall awesome then we're flushed out [Music]", "start": 17.1, "duration": 22.217999999999996}
{"chunk": "we're talking about load phase dog this is kind of a cool way to think about golf swinging I think you earned this right eventually but we have anything about the old golf swing is a load phase", "start": 28.279, "duration": 18.462}
{"chunk": "and an unload phase okay like super simply yeah if you know the P system like p1p2 okay um easy way to think about that as well", "start": 38.1, "duration": 19.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "is P1 is a dress P4 is top of golf swing pop a backswing and then the other phases are just levels different levels", "start": 47.04, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "so either Club level P2 P3 lead arm level to the ground okay got it then we get up here to P4 so P5", "start": 55.739, "duration": 20.101}
{"chunk": "would be from P4 going back down to level with this lead arm okay that's the finish of the load phase yeah okay so that's a very important distinction", "start": 65.46, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "right most people would go load phase unload so that's like backswing downswing right load unload right but that's not it not our preferred pattern", "start": 74.1, "duration": 18.901}
{"chunk": "okay you can do that but we we like to load for longer okay and by the way understanding what we're", "start": 83.22, "duration": 16.380000000000003}
{"chunk": "meaning by load phase is really important too like obviously the club needs to be loaded so we are bowing it there's some torque", "start": 92.22, "duration": 17.7}
{"chunk": "um you're loading up arm lines okay and you're loading up the lead side upper spiral line loading a spiral line", "start": 100.38, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "is super similar to the boat drill which you've done that that video before but if I'm going to load this lead side upper spiral okay I'm taking this upper", "start": 109.68, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "spiral and I'm just pulling on it got it so just knocks the air out of you right it's like compresses your diaphragm the whole thing sure so that's", "start": 118.02, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "loaded a loaded fascia line is just one that's stretched okay so this line that you just showed right across here is", "start": 125.939, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "stretching yep exactly exactly so I'm sure what you could do is just put up the fascial line sure of the Spiral it's that nice blue line looks like a rubber", "start": 133.8, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "band and we're just pulling that rubber band from right up in here under that scap and across here up back and away that's a loaded spiral okay so at P5", "start": 142.44, "duration": 17.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "we're here so you can see this is pulled up back and away you can see how this Gap is depressed this is all like these", "start": 151.02, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "ribs are separated you see this nice Bend in the thoracic so you can see how this spiral going this way is pulling you up back and away", "start": 159.48, "duration": 17.820999999999998}
{"chunk": "so that's one okay and we also want the lead posterior arm line okay to be loaded okay so one of the easiest", "start": 167.4, "duration": 18.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "ways to do that is adduct okay there you go so we're adducting this lead arm and you can feel from right here this whole line that whole", "start": 177.599, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "fascial line is stretched and the anterior Trail arm work is stretched so that's just going this way yep yep so that's a ton of adduction", "start": 186.0, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "some scaps and blah blah blah okay okay but in essence if I do that you'll feel this load stretch if I do this you'll feel this load and stretch yep that's", "start": 194.94, "duration": 17.818999999999996}

{"chunk": "it so how do we get there this is a really great drill so if you have a medicine ball especially this one's nice or a kettlebell would be good yeah so if", "start": 211.5, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "you're holding it here and I want to move the ball well I could move it in a couple of different ways I could do this", "start": 220.08, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "which is let's just eye test this does this look better or does this look better yeah I'm gonna go with the second one exactly most people would agree like", "start": 227.64, "duration": 18.541}
{"chunk": "second one looks a little bit better yep okay well what we're seeing again from the eye test is like oh that athletically looks better okay and what", "start": 237.42, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "we're doing when we're doing this properly let's just focus on the posterior lead arm line as soon as I move my center of mass and", "start": 245.76, "duration": 16.378}
{"chunk": "my ribs away from the Target and I leave the arms and the ball behind I do not load this okay so that that lead arm Line's not", "start": 253.019, "duration": 19.202}
{"chunk": "loaded yet the backswing the whole time in the backswing I'm not loading the the posterior interesting which I mean maybe we're jumping ahead here but one of the", "start": 262.62, "duration": 18.899}
{"chunk": "main things that we see as a fault right is immediate load is a lead arm so once you add duct you've loaded the posterior", "start": 272.22, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "lead arm weight it's all stretched yep right the problem with that is if we kept doing that all the way up to the top to the top one the club could get way deep and number two in transition", "start": 281.04, "duration": 21.419999999999998}
{"chunk": "from P4 to P5 it's wanting to unload yeah totally exactly which is a problem because now we're getting all the unload", "start": 290.58, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "here there ain't no ball back here man it's down here still yeah so what do you got from here you just like push and do", "start": 298.919, "duration": 15.661000000000001}
{"chunk": "all kinds of stuff and juice it yeah yeah I got it it's just this extra like late blast that just feels gross super un like inefficient Okay so", "start": 307.08, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "no good to move the ball with adduction early yep okay way better to move the ribs so how this would work so if I've", "start": 316.74, "duration": 15.479999999999999}
{"chunk": "got this Trail side upper spiral line yep I want that activation to toss the arms up for most", "start": 324.66, "duration": 19.8}
{"chunk": "folks okay now again you can overdo it because this doesn't look all that good either no it doesn't right so there is some amount of arm fire but for most", "start": 334.74, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "people because they arm fire too much in excess and early it's going to feel way better for them to sling their arms up", "start": 343.44, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "here because of the Spiral because of the ribs and how this works again so we'll go lateral movement so there's the rib Sway in the rib see I just can leave", "start": 351.78, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "my arms and hands and Club behind here and then now as I go upper upper upper spiral upper spiral upper spiral oh look at that yeah I almost look fully turned", "start": 360.479, "duration": 17.701}
{"chunk": "and my arms are still down here yeah so maybe you could like face down the line here because that's a really interesting look what I just saw there", "start": 369.18, "duration": 16.139000000000003}
{"chunk": "so go ahead and show me that those spiral lines starting to swing so we got rib sway upperspire upper spiral upper spiral upper spiral upper spiral good", "start": 377.4, "duration": 17.581}
{"chunk": "and like to you this is like pretty dang relaxed right here right and it's like yeah it's just limp noodle right exactly so at what point does that actually get", "start": 385.68, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "stretched well that's super important to know okay right so this is why it's so so", "start": 394.62, "duration": 15.901}
{"chunk": "so important to look at the golf swing as Dynamic and not static so drills where folks will go up to the top and", "start": 402.72, "duration": 15.9}
{"chunk": "hold the reason that I can hold it up here is because that's an activated like muscle that's muscle activation fascial", "start": 411.06, "duration": 16.859}
{"chunk": "activation yeah so now I can hold it up here when in actuality what we would like to see is sure it would kind of just super soft", "start": 419.22, "duration": 17.781}
{"chunk": "yeah exactly exactly so what we want is enough energy in this Trail upper spiral", "start": 427.68, "duration": 15.700000000000001}
{"chunk": "line sure to sling or toss the arms up got it and as they're going up I could fall and start to turn the other", "start": 435.9, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "way got it so there's two different ways to to add duct I can either add duck because of the arm actually adducting so this the the", "start": 444.479, "duration": 20.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "active mover here is the humerus okay right the humerus bone is moving now I loaded that up or I can start turning", "start": 454.199, "duration": 17.701999999999998}
{"chunk": "the rib system into it and now I've adducted gotcha so that was nothing you did by actually moving the arm this way but if", "start": 463.08, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "you move your ribs into that system now this all loads up exactly so this all will work this way so go back to neutral they're set up okay so if you go rib", "start": 472.5, "duration": 17.879}
{"chunk": "sway and there's the up there's the upper spiral and they'll start to Upper spirals upper spiral upper spiral upper spiral and in actuality the arms would", "start": 482.039, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "be about right here if you did that with enough energy you'd toss the arms up like your arms would keep working up yeah that act alone initiates a little", "start": 489.24, "duration": 21.299}
{"chunk": "bit of that posterior lead arm line but as I'm doing this I got your arm you're gonna drop and start to rotate the ribs the other way", "start": 499.259, "duration": 16.921999999999997}
{"chunk": "now it's loaded yep now it's fully loaded now what does it want to do now I can unload it at the proper time so that's such a good feeling when that", "start": 508.44, "duration": 16.918999999999997}
{"chunk": "happens exactly exactly so we have a no no load in in backswing here yep then in the transition phase so this is this is", "start": 516.3, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "a good look too so from P1 to about P 2.5 ish somewhere between like P2 and P3 okay that's the finish of the backswing", "start": 526.14, "duration": 18.18}
{"chunk": "okay okay say that again yeah right so I'm done yeah I'm done now if I put enough energy in this upper spiral it", "start": 534.959, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "slings up to the top yeah it's it's just not actively being boom boom boom boom yep yep so we're not just pushing this up here to get to the to get to the top", "start": 544.86, "duration": 17.221}
{"chunk": "yeah right like now I've loaded this yeah no dice okay so we have to have the the transition is from like P 2.5 to P5", "start": 553.26, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "which is that's the transition phase right compared to how most people view transition right and that's why like when we're when we're loading this up", "start": 562.92, "duration": 16.221}
{"chunk": "we've got swing I'm active it goes swing slow stop yeah what", "start": 570.18, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "swing slow stop that's the backswing whoo we just started the transition which again that kind of leads back to what you were saying before like when", "start": 579.54, "duration": 16.739}
{"chunk": "people do these like freezer drills for instance right what you're showing there is like is like this club's like falling on you that's how it should kind of feel", "start": 588.18, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "at the top yep and when people do freezer drills it's like push activate now I'm gonna try to hit it from here I want width yeah well you're training a", "start": 596.519, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "quick unload yeah because it's loaded yeah because you can't can't keep that right well you could you could but it's going to feel gross", "start": 604.8, "duration": 17.939}
{"chunk": "yeah that's like nobody's gonna do that everybody's going to want to hit sure well the reason that we hit is we've loaded up a fascia line sure like if I'm gonna smoke you I'm going whoa anterior", "start": 613.98, "duration": 21.481}
{"chunk": "yeah Trail arm I could smoke you right now yeah boom right yeah okay well if I did this see how like in this in this phase", "start": 623.88, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "anterior line isn't loaded so I would have to step keep this going away now it's loaded now I can fire so we want the load phase to be at the the", "start": 633.959, "duration": 19.801}
{"chunk": "appropriate time so the unload phase can be at the appropriate time so the fully loaded all of those lines loaded are", "start": 643.68, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "much later than most people would generally do that and much calmer you're not trying to load it's a passive load", "start": 651.66, "duration": 15.42}
{"chunk": "sure all you do is fall and turn to load there you go so now we've got upper spiral posterior lead arm line anterior Trail Online that's hard as a rock right", "start": 658.74, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "there so now if you just fire everything just goes you can just wash all the energy out of the system but before then before that hard as a rock everything's", "start": 668.339, "duration": 16.98}
{"chunk": "chill and chill and it builds it builds it's wave-like yeah calm it starts to Crest and then it can wash out yeah", "start": 676.079, "duration": 17.221}
{"chunk": "right so we've got no load phase when it comes to this lead arm line that's the finish of the backswing got it this is the start of transition", "start": 684.36, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "because it would still be going up I would be dropping and starting to turn the other way okay so that's transition now I'm fully loaded so now I can go", "start": 693.959, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "into the unload phase okay no load load unload huh yeah that's the sequence that's the sequence okay yep so that's", "start": 701.88, "duration": 17.939}
{"chunk": "the the load is really important because what we're constantly looking to do is feel better and better through the unload phase well if you don't work the", "start": 711.24, "duration": 16.261000000000003}
{"chunk": "load phase appropriately yeah it's harder down it's going to be difficult down at the end it's harder through here exactly and when guys are", "start": 719.16, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "hitting it really well consistently really well they feel tremendous from P5 to like P9 the finish of their golf swing", "start": 727.26, "duration": 18.259}
{"chunk": "and that's hole unloads like easy and a lot of that tremendous feeling that you're talking about happens just because this load phase was so nice", "start": 735.92, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "right now from here like it's pretty simple to unload the golf club right it's just turn the chest yep let the club out yep exactly so that makes it so", "start": 743.7, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "much easier and and guys explain it in such funny ways uh you know I hit it really well today because my rhythm was good what the heck", "start": 753.3, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "does that mean what is rhythm right my I felt good with my tempo I covered it like everybody's just trying to say something that just encapsulates like", "start": 762.18, "duration": 18.839}
{"chunk": "the whole thing the reason that happens is because they are loading and unloading their system at the proper times appropriately and in nice Rhythm", "start": 771.899, "duration": 20.341}
{"chunk": "it's wave-like it's not bolts yeah boom it loads and washes out yeah depending on how far you want to hit it right so that like wave like Rhythm that's like", "start": 782.1, "duration": 19.619}
{"chunk": "such a fundamental like Testament to what we're talking about here right absolutely and fascia and muscle activation likes to work in waves not in", "start": 791.459, "duration": 19.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "pulses it's a very safe way to operate got it and super efficient because it won't feel like you're working that hard okay", "start": 801.72, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "you can blessed it so what's maybe an exercise that we could do with a golf club right and again talking novice intermediate", "start": 810.06, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "to teach them how to load this up I would start without a golf club start without a golf so something that has a lot of weight or mass to it 20 pounds or so yeah but we want to move this like if", "start": 818.519, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "not if this is super heavy like if I'm holding like a big old TV right here the last thing I'm going to do is move it with my arms no you're going to have to move with your whole body right exactly", "start": 827.639, "duration": 17.461000000000002}
{"chunk": "exactly so to get this swinging yep I need to start moving the center of mass and see how another of mass being in here Center mass of my ribs so I got", "start": 836.04, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "Center Mass over here and then here come the arms then the center Mass goes over here there goes the arms if I just tossed a little like upper", "start": 844.98, "duration": 16.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "spiral with this in the backswing we would toss it up here even got yourself a bag okay well but if you watch the rhythm of it", "start": 854.7, "duration": 16.1}
{"chunk": "swing slow stop yep so now if I wanted to Huck it the other way I could drop and toss it out here so that's that's", "start": 861.72, "duration": 16.459}
{"chunk": "again that's how that loading that fully load happens you got swing slow stop drop yep and turn and as that's happening now you get to unload zip it", "start": 873.779, "duration": 18.059}
{"chunk": "out the other way yeah you can toss anything out that way you want right even if it's really massive you can still Huck it but you're never going to Huck it this way no but you get a lot", "start": 883.139, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "tighter right Golf Club in your hand and it's easy to do that so training with that heavy thing in your hand exactly forces you to do some of these things right exactly and then what you can do", "start": 891.839, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "is just kind of play around with some extension in the trail wrist to load up the club head okay so because again this", "start": 901.139, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "doesn't look quite right now it looks more floppy it's floppy and you don't know where the golf club is okay so as you start to go here sound like sending", "start": 908.639, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "the arms like this way my ribs are going the opposite way won't then I could feel all right what if I just went boom boom so I'm still ribs then extension", "start": 917.94, "duration": 19.678}
{"chunk": "the trail wrist and you're just loading up that trail right arms there goes there go my ribs and then there goes the trail rest exactly now you'll feel the", "start": 927.839, "duration": 15.960999999999999}
{"chunk": "whole system like work yep and if you put enough energy in it it'll float up there there you go as it's floating you drop and start to turn", "start": 935.519, "duration": 19.921}
{"chunk": "out the other way there it is look how long you chill yeah so if you hit a ball like that teach", "start": 945.06, "duration": 15.259}
{"chunk": "okay same deal same deal same exercise as the ball is just see how long you can float up there yeah because this is in the", "start": 952.519, "duration": 17.179}
{"chunk": "process of loading this meaning the posterior Elite armlet in the process of now it's loaded I feel like I can go so almost the longer you wait the more it", "start": 966.48, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "can load right decent way looking at it the more that the ribs can separate away from that lead arm line now it can't load it it's it's well it's unloaded it", "start": 974.639, "duration": 18.901}
{"chunk": "can load but it's unloaded right now so it can't fire if a fashion line is unloaded it can't fire or it feels gross too sure right so now I got it now I've", "start": 984.54, "duration": 18.421}
{"chunk": "got to like wait for it to load now I can fire whoo there you go it says you're falling and going the other way oh now it's", "start": 993.48, "duration": 16.019000000000002}
{"chunk": "adducted it's loaded you can fire so let's show on that like almost looks absurdly long in transition we'll see what that looks like let's get crazier with the separation between the ribs and", "start": 1001.759, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "the lead arm oh shank that was awesome that was awesome now do that again yeah but all", "start": 1010.699, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "that is is you want to let the arms and your body fall on this side for longer so it's not rotated to throw it out so", "start": 1019.1, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "early so that was like fall longer there yep and I'm going there there you go the turn is to sling", "start": 1027.5, "duration": 15.539}
{"chunk": "the arms out got it you just fall up there fall awesome now we're flushed out so now it's not pitching over the", "start": 1035.179, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "plate cool yeah super good yeah okay now last one to kind of wrap it up here okay show one with early abduction okay to", "start": 1042.98, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "swing the golf club back so you're not doing it with your ribs you're doing with this lead arm and just hit one just a normal one but just like early ad deck like right off the bat", "start": 1051.26, "duration": 17.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "that looks a heck of a lot different yeah and it feels world's different too yeah it does yep okay so again going to this load phase understanding our three", "start": 1059.96, "duration": 17.700000000000003}
{"chunk": "phases we got backswing face which again is from like P1 to P 2.5 P3 at the very latest got it", "start": 1068.72, "duration": 18.54}

{"chunk": "and now we've got the unload face got it there'd be no load backswing load transition unload through impact and then to finish so those are the three", "start": 1087.919, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "phases load unload that's the golf swing okay and it unloads what we're looking for yeah is way less complex", "start": 1096.26, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "than the load or the the backswing and and the transition the whole load phase so that's why we spend so much time spent spent there yeah so that when", "start": 1105.98, "duration": 19.319}
{"chunk": "you're organized here you can just fire and go yeah and not even really think through the strike it just makes it so much easier way easier yeah so load", "start": 1116.419, "duration": 15.061}
