{"chunk": "good questions about back swing what the wrists do like really everything in here okay I think we can go over that my first question to you is how do you define the arms and how do you define", "start": 42.66, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "the hands like is there a cut off in your mind sure I mean I think we've talked about this before like anything below wrist or", "start": 51.96, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "or what forearm mid forearm yeah is hand action right and then anything above there up into the shoulder line is arm", "start": 60.78, "duration": 15.961}
{"chunk": "action yeah right and I I really think it's important to like differentiate the two because sure like if you just look at anatomically like the forearm section", "start": 68.88, "duration": 20.339}
{"chunk": "and anatomically the upper arm section like there's one bone here there's two bones here sure right like this can do this and this if I if I rotate it it", "start": 78.78, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "looks completely different like that's an internal and external compared to pronation and supination okay so what this is doing directly affects down here", "start": 88.439, "duration": 20.040999999999997}
{"chunk": "when we think of the hands we think from below the wrist so if I do anything in here that's a pronation supination action that's that's the two bones in", "start": 98.1, "duration": 17.76}
{"chunk": "here directly affects the hand though exactly the ulnar and the radius is is totally affecting what the hand itself is doing got it so that's why we go cut", "start": 107.22, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "off is right here at the elbow all the way down to the fingertips that's hand action and arm actions up here okay cool right so that's just our definition by", "start": 116.22, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "the way you can have your own definition that's just how we see things yeah um let's talk about arm actions specifically okay in this video so", "start": 125.1, "duration": 15.541}
{"chunk": "anything above the elbow exactly anything above the elbow we might dabble down in here but this is just going to be like secondary to what I'm talking", "start": 132.54, "duration": 18.598999999999997}
{"chunk": "about here yep exactly to the arms got it I'd like to reverse engineer this um from the standpoint of", "start": 141.599, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "if we just look at the golf swing in general we have a load phase and we have an unload phase so let's start with the unload phase and then we can work backwards because it's really important", "start": 149.34, "duration": 20.698999999999998}
{"chunk": "to start to identify like how the arms do hit the ball because it does it's a great feeling I think a lot of times we", "start": 158.819, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "there's this we get misconstrued sometimes in that like once we're in P5 to delivery or the finish of the load phase then now we just don't do anything", "start": 167.94, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "with the arms and you just turn and it just makes it feel like these just are like back here in space somewhere and there's never this hit when there should", "start": 176.519, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "be like the arms do fire the body does fire it's the whole system that fires yeah so let's let's first describe this go ahead and give me your clothes", "start": 184.2, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "and go ahead and just put both arms up in front of you here just like this show me lead arm AB a b duction", "start": 193.86, "duration": 20.34}
{"chunk": "exactly okay okay show me trail arm a deduction adduction that is the hip that we're looking for", "start": 203.099, "duration": 15.780000000000001}
{"chunk": "so this look here that look right there yeah and it's a really it's it's kind of a fun like hit feel because if I had something in my hands right here and I just went Wham", "start": 211.739, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "exactly it's a it's a strong hit you can feel like the whole upper spiral really helping facilitate that meaning from like the ribs to the top like the bottom", "start": 220.92, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "of the ribs to the top of that yeah okay like you can feel lat you can feel posterior line you can feel Frontline like you feel like anterior you feel everything it's just a good solid boom", "start": 229.86, "duration": 21.0}
{"chunk": "okay and it feels stable okay now the reason that you're able to do that teach go ahead and go this way perfect both of your elbows if I put a", "start": 239.58, "duration": 20.459}
{"chunk": "sensor here and a sensor there or in front of your torso meaning there's your torso line okay right from", "start": 250.319, "duration": 15.062}
{"chunk": "an anterior this would be posterior torso line okay okay anterior torso alive see how ball sensors are in front of that so you have room for this Trail", "start": 257.76, "duration": 21.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "elbow complex to fire across uh-huh because they're out in front exactly okay okay that's what we want", "start": 268.08, "duration": 17.641}
{"chunk": "just hold on to that thought both elbows at delivery are going to be in front of the Torso that's what we're looking for okay okay gotta so show the load face so", "start": 276.9, "duration": 20.28}
{"chunk": "the load phase again is from P1 to P5 that's how we are generalizing the load phase and then the unload phase is going to be from P5 to pap9 whatever the", "start": 287.46, "duration": 17.88}
{"chunk": "Finish is okay let's go from P1 to just P4 the top of the backswing okay yep so this is an issue that we see a lot of", "start": 295.62, "duration": 17.939999999999998}
{"chunk": "players do when they try to shallow the golf club they will actively adduct this lead arm so the lead humerus will go into the", "start": 305.52, "duration": 18.6}

{"chunk": "behind or under the plane great that is a way to shallow it it's not the preferred way because now we have an issue if I just take away you stay right", "start": 322.5, "duration": 17.399}

{"chunk": "powerful got it like all the energy all the forces can spit out but the problem with that is now like if we dabble down", "start": 376.08, "duration": 16.139}
{"chunk": "in here the Hub path which I think we've talked about a little bit before it's just the point in space that's in between the hands it's a pivot point", "start": 383.639, "duration": 15.299}

{"chunk": "turn see where the Hub path got thrown yeah out to the yeah right no longer can it radically curve which is what we want we", "start": 400.38, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "want it to curve right around this complex that's the stability feel and I can hold load for longer when this elbow", "start": 409.38, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "just gets spit see how all the load gets thrown out yes the Hub gets thrown out the rate of rotation the club face gets whacked right the bottom out is way more", "start": 416.58, "duration": 16.500999999999998}
{"chunk": "difficult to control it's just much more difficult to control the bottom the hit and it doesn't feel as organized so just", "start": 424.74, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "generally feels kind of Grody got it so yeah that's shallowing however I just got both of the sensors", "start": 433.68, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "well at least one of them trapped behind my torso and it no longer can swing I no longer can simply adduct this lead arm", "start": 442.74, "duration": 15.059000000000001}
{"chunk": "got it okay so let's go back up to P4 sure and this one again is kind of an interesting feel if we're focusing on", "start": 450.599, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "this lead sensor lead elbow sensor with this kind of an action trying to point that sensor Towards the Sky", "start": 457.86, "duration": 16.679}
{"chunk": "see how this never lowered stayed up yeah it stayed up but that action this is an active action meaning you're focused on here right that is internal", "start": 466.8, "duration": 19.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "rotation along with lead shoulder flexion that's an up move okay the combo makes it look that way got it so", "start": 476.58, "duration": 17.3}
{"chunk": "shoulder flexion would be this yeah internal rotations of this exactly that feeling that you just showed right there is a combo of those two things and what", "start": 485.16, "duration": 15.699000000000002}
{"chunk": "you just showed when you were just doing this this is a combo of them both just lead lead arm internal rotation would just spin this in space yeah this point", "start": 493.56, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "doesn't really move yep okay so this isn't what we're talking about I'm trying to get this going that way see how the Hub path The Hub", "start": 501.18, "duration": 18.48}

{"chunk": "that right here okay and you felt that action that's a combo of shoulder flexion and internal rotation if you show just internal rotation", "start": 519.959, "duration": 17.341}
{"chunk": "sure the Hub path goes sure so it didn't really do anything here which is what I want to get at so let's go back up to P4 okay so again if we're looking at this just", "start": 528.6, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "going okay now because of this active action what did this do passively externally", "start": 537.959, "duration": 16.900000000000002}

{"chunk": "rotation is still rotating but it's much less yes the forces got shot out that way exactly so put that arm right where you were again there you go see where my", "start": 577.62, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "hand is just give me a high five hard there you go see how that's a good solid hit do it again firmer there so you can hit", "start": 586.98, "duration": 16.560000000000002}

{"chunk": "all the way to P5 so the reason that that dropped right there the main reason like it's lowering is because you're dropping the pelvis ah okay so this is", "start": 750.959, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "why transitions so hard there's like 900 things like that there's so many things going on exactly where his backswing is like okay upper spiral and maybe a", "start": 760.56, "duration": 17.160999999999998}
