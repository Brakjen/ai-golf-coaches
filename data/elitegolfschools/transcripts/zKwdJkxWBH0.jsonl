{"chunk": "what up homie what up dude we're going to talk about the top three reasons why you chunk a golf ball and we're going to", "start": 0.76, "duration": 15.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "fix you let's [Music] go te can you show us what a like a real golf ball looks like before we start", "start": 7.72, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "into gross stuff just hit a good one I just have to have a good one first so show us a good one okay that was nice so", "start": 21.56, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "now we want to get that yeah okay so here's why people chunk it people are like okay well I'm I'm bombing out behind it I.E that's a chunk but they", "start": 32.239, "duration": 18.322}
{"chunk": "don't know why that's happening sure CU we hear this like get to your left side all the time hear that a lot getting to your left side means that we're moving", "start": 42.12, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "pressure to the Lead Foot which for you te is a right-handed player that's going to be your left foot yes well I can move my pressure like if I were on a force", "start": 50.76, "duration": 16.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "plate right here up to this left side a number of different ways I could just shove my pelvis this direction and now I have more pressure here than on my right", "start": 59.68, "duration": 16.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "foot for sure okay or I could move my ribs this way the arms attach into the pelvic system or", "start": 67.88, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "the rib system the rib system okay yeah the arms are what are in charge of swinging the instrument sure okay so where this", "start": 77.159, "duration": 18.76}
{"chunk": "system bottoms out is going to reflect where we're going to shove the golf club into the ground the midpoint of the arms is right here in the sternum okay this", "start": 86.439, "duration": 19.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "is the point that we want to look at I see the other thing that's really interesting to here is just general human balance the pelvis and the ribs are always moving in opposition to one", "start": 96.72, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "another to just stay in Balance if I move both the ribs and the pelvis forward I'm going to fall forward you'll lose your balance absolutely so if this starts going forward because I'm trying", "start": 105.68, "duration": 19.839}
{"chunk": "to get my weight forward in my way of doing it where's the ribs go there you go now where's your sternum yeah back behind the golf ball now and that's", "start": 115.28, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "where you're going to create the bottom out I see I see that's where chunks come from so if people are really trying to get to their left side through this motion y they could be making their", "start": 124.24, "duration": 16.958}
{"chunk": "chunk problem worse so you did your job you got to the left side yeah but the ribs are what's controlling this there you go the ribs are going that way", "start": 132.319, "duration": 17.002000000000002}
{"chunk": "that's a problem because they work in opposition to keep you in Balance because you don't want to fall in your face absolutely okay so let's show one", "start": 141.0, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "that would be improp so this would be the pelvis moving towards the target so you're getting your weight forward but the but the ribs or the sternum is", "start": 148.92, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "falling behind so what we'll probably find is a bottom out here all right let's see so this would be improper okay there you go chunk City 101 chunk", "start": 157.239, "duration": 19.96}
{"chunk": "City 101 for sure okay so now let's do this same thing getting weight forward but you're going to do it through the rib system really easy way to feel that", "start": 166.879, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "is as you move forward into the golf ball your head or your hat is going to move towards the Target right off the Inception of your forward swing there", "start": 175.879, "duration": 17.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "you go like up to the top and now you're going to move your head up here there you go good excellent so now we got bottom out control that's up here okay", "start": 184.4, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "let's go ahead and hit one now beautiful so bottom out taken care of yes now there's danger with this", "start": 193.2, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "because most of the folks that we see when they get up here to the top in order for them to try to get forward what they'll do is they'll work in this space m i see that a lot too okay yep so", "start": 201.76, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "it'll pitch the golf club over the top of the plane and now we have a whole another set of issues so we see that action right there and this will make the problem worse almost all the time", "start": 210.72, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "because what happens there like how this whole right arm and like your right shoulder kind of works is when you're here and trying to go uh into this lead", "start": 219.64, "duration": 18.799}
{"chunk": "foot this way what that leaks into is this upper bone in your arm is called the humoris it internally rotates when", "start": 228.28, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "we do that and so the problem with that action at the very top is it pitches the golf club way over the top of the plane and you'll just end up shoving the golf", "start": 236.76, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "club into the ground so like the angle that the golf club's working into the turf with is like oh my gosh straight in the turf and it feels horrible yep while", "start": 244.879, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "you are moving the the center mass of your ribs forward we need to be able to move the instrument the golf club under the plane", "start": 253.36, "duration": 18.879}
{"chunk": "okay so it needs to go under so that now it can be more level into the ground okay we do that so how do we do that a lot of different ways to do it what I", "start": 261.88, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "would love people to feel is the golf club what it needs to do from right here is work vertical okay in this space see", "start": 269.96, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "how this the the club head itself is just working straight down okay got it it's right at me yep if you move this internal see how this is working", "start": 278.68, "duration": 15.920000000000002}
{"chunk": "horizontal so it's moving in this in this Vector rather than in here there instead of there exactly okay okay now", "start": 286.639, "duration": 15.201}
{"chunk": "there's a number of different ways that you can do that but what I would like you to just combo right in this space right in here is as your head's moving towards the towards the target we're", "start": 294.68, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "going to move the club head vertical it's in this space now we've got everything worked out properly got it and we need it vertical so that now it", "start": 303.32, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "can move horizontal meaning forward towards the target okay so it's not just going to keep going this way no no no we're going to go here and out yes so", "start": 312.039, "duration": 19.24}
{"chunk": "what we would like and this is just this would make General sense the golf ball is sitting here I would like at the moment of the strike for the ins the", "start": 321.96, "duration": 16.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "golf club to work right into it boom that way not that way yeah so this is another one of those terms that we hear", "start": 329.84, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "in golf Lon hit down on the ball sure sure okay well yeah is the angle attack with some clubs down sure sure but with", "start": 336.96, "duration": 19.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "some clubs it's up we're talking about at most like 7\u00b0 from Level that's not that much it's", "start": 346.919, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "not that much so we're not going 90 uh-uh this isn't effective well what we're really wanting is into it into it it's level relatively level for sure so", "start": 355.36, "duration": 20.92}
{"chunk": "just a visual just a visual in your mind what we want is a horizontal hit there's going to be a little bit of a downward", "start": 365.44, "duration": 16.6}
{"chunk": "action but again that's because my Center Mass my ribs is forward of the golf ball here so this will be the bottom out so down back where the golf", "start": 374.0, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "ball is I might be down on it a couple a very few amount of degrees down on the ball because the ribs are up here", "start": 383.8, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "exactly but I need a horizontal or a level hit so if I'm going ribs up here and a vertical hit yeah we've got deep", "start": 392.199, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "well and it's a vertical hit because I've got ribs here and then a horizontal movement of the golf club sure see how it's going it's not going down this", "start": 401.56, "duration": 16.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "isn't this is down this is vertical movement of the club this is horizontal movement of the club it's because it's horizontal too early and now it's it's", "start": 409.8, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "vertical l right okay so what we need is as I'm moving my head forward I need the center mass of the club or the club head itself", "start": 418.8, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "to work vertical so it's working in here so that now as I turn it can be a horizontal hit so it's vertical to", "start": 426.8, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "horizontal good so te go ahead and hit us one here sure but do it at a very cruisy pace and you're managing two", "start": 434.68, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "things you're managing this and you're managing the vertical nature of that club in transition okay Cruis yes beautiful so now we have an angle of", "start": 443.36, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "attack that's like appropriate it doesn't feel down and over it this hit totally feels horrible this hit feels", "start": 454.479, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "great mhm last piece with this okay and this is this is piece three piece three is what the pelvis is really doing okay", "start": 462.319, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "okay so most of the time what people will get in trouble with is they're they're hitting behind it chunking it sure so they try to get further away from it but it makes makes the problem", "start": 471.159, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "that much worse so they're trying to create space cuz they don't want to hit back here M okay so what they do is they'll rise and end up making the", "start": 480.0, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "problem worse so as my pelvis goes up my pelvis is going vertical what do I now need to do with the club move it vertical so I'm shoving it down yeah for", "start": 488.72, "duration": 19.201}
{"chunk": "sure okay so we want this horizontal hit right so in in this transitionary phase yeah you", "start": 499.12, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "drop drop so I'm vertical here this is a vertical move I'm lowering it doesn't need to be a ton it can be some people might feel a ton", "start": 506.56, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "because they're so far up here but if I'm just dropping here now what do I get to do in the hit turn the chest uhhuh and the Turning of the chest is this a", "start": 516.44, "duration": 16.441}
{"chunk": "vertical or a horizontal look there's the horizontal there you go okay so all of our verticals are up in here sure okay we're", "start": 524.68, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "dropping there's vertical this is vertical the only thing that we're doing horizontal is we're moving the center of mass of the the ribs or the head forward", "start": 533.76, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "there you go that's transition so now from there you can go horizontal with your chest and horizontal with the club and that's the hit there you go got it", "start": 541.72, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "so a lot of these things are just opposite of what most people try to do yes yeah most most of the comments that we get on a number of our videos is like", "start": 551.12, "duration": 15.118}
{"chunk": "when I drop I feel like I'm going to chunk it you absolutely will if you if you run this down mhm and run this horizontal sure because now I'm shoving", "start": 558.399, "duration": 17.842}
{"chunk": "it in the ground all the forces are going here there yeah so it's opposite force with the club but we're still dropping in", "start": 567.6, "duration": 16.038}
{"chunk": "here there you go because now yeah so the lower like this is the visual the lower that I go this way like my body's", "start": 574.519, "duration": 15.002}
{"chunk": "Center of mass the lower it goes the more now this hit goes out so this is a horizontal hit yes the higher my center", "start": 582.2, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "of mass of my body goes the more vertical my hit gets so the angle of attack is like interesting okay so we got three three", "start": 591.079, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "things the bottom out is really indicative of where the center of mass of the rib system is at the strike so it needs to be far enough forward that now", "start": 599.959, "duration": 17.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "because the arms are swinging out of the rib system that's where our bottom out is going to be it's going to be further forward okay got it yep number two we", "start": 609.12, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "need the club head in this transitionary phase from the top of the Swing to move in a vertical manner going that direction so that now in the strike you", "start": 617.44, "duration": 19.281}
{"chunk": "can move horizontal vertical and now horizontal great and the final piece is we are dropping the pelvis so there's a", "start": 626.44, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "vertical drop in transition so we're dropping so that now the ribs can turn and you're", "start": 636.12, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "going horizontal with the hit so it's a drop and turn got it now you can mix all three of those together or you can just", "start": 643.32, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "focus on one because the nice thing is is when one operates well the other pieces that we talked about there all three pieces they operate together very", "start": 652.36, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "seamlessly so you could hit five golf balls just feeling drop and turn you could hit five golf balls feeling the center mass of the club head going", "start": 661.56, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "vertical horizontal you hit five golf balls feeling in this transitionary phase to get the system the rib system far enough forward and you'll start to feel everything kind of glom together", "start": 669.399, "duration": 19.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "yes and they all operate together that's cool which is really cool yeah no more chunks baby yes sir no more chunks no more chunks only flushies only flushers", "start": 679.12, "duration": 19.41}
{"chunk": "here on well guys so let's [Music]", "start": 688.6, "duration": 19.869999999999997}
