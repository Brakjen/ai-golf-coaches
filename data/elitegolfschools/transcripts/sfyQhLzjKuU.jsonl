{"chunk": "today we are going to talk about how control the golf ball at like extremely extremely Elite levels like you see", "start": 27.24, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "these guys on tour and how they command the golf ball it's it's sometimes remarkable", "start": 35.8, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "how well they can command the ball they need to hit a little tight draw command like trajectory how much energy they're putting on the golf ball that they do it", "start": 43.36, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "at levels that are obviously the best in the world and so the question them then is like well how and", "start": 53.16, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "and why and how are they doing this and what's really fun and the reason that I love a a systems-based", "start": 62.84, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "approach to understanding the golf swing is because number one you understand just a general way to command the golf club as it relates to the body so in", "start": 71.2, "duration": 20.079}
{"chunk": "general you hit better shots and there's a number of different ways to go go about doing that however the then there's this", "start": 81.2, "duration": 17.48}
{"chunk": "conversation like we have you know you hear all these silly phrases right like hey trust the process you just work on your golf swing like in in training and", "start": 90.28, "duration": 17.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "then you don't think about it when you go out and play and like there's all this just honestly false information out there that doesn't really serve one", "start": 99.799, "duration": 18.72}

{"chunk": "you in commanding the golf club and the golf ball you can do that but just understand that the old pathway never goes away okay getting back on track", "start": 126.399, "duration": 15.161000000000001}
{"chunk": "here how to command the golf ball at these these Elite levels well number one when you're working on on technique and if you're new to our Channel definitely", "start": 134.239, "duration": 15.88}
{"chunk": "take a look at a lot of our just kind of basic understandings of golf swing it'll take you through you know this this idea", "start": 141.519, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "of like potentially the difference between a swinger type pattern and a hitter type pattern and the difference between those two because you look at like you know", "start": 149.56, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "Victor hin or Neeman or Meo those kinds of athletes and then you take a look at other athletes like web Simpson Jimmy Walker um players that look like that", "start": 158.0, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "and and they're quite different really now they're still able to command the ball but they look different so H how", "start": 167.44, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "and why is that the case right that's the question and so what I'm going to take a deeper dive into today is more of a hitter type", "start": 175.04, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "pattern and just real quick crash quarts on this like a hitter pattern we are defining this as a player who maintains", "start": 184.36, "duration": 18.678}
{"chunk": "this hip flexion or pelvic drop and is very thoracic in their rotation through the hit if you're going to do that the golf club has to move in this space like", "start": 193.519, "duration": 18.522}

{"chunk": "folks if you're struggling with driver you should have driver in your hand getting this System Incorporated now what what all I'm focusing really is", "start": 261.919, "duration": 19.36}

{"chunk": "cover there are so many constants setup will be a constant the start of our back swing will be a constant transition for", "start": 463.319, "duration": 16.842}

{"chunk": "pressure that I'm going to put on that Aspen with that Axe and then next I want you to go ahead and full ham Hawk this Sequoia tree so we're going to knock it", "start": 574.079, "duration": 16.961}

{"chunk": "start with the three and we'll build off of this so this is all energy and ball flight distance management", "start": 608.12, "duration": 16.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "here okay pretty good rep right there we'll just see what the numbers are so we'll use for Sight numbers here on the quad we have it set up for for", "start": 618.399, "duration": 20.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "our athletes where we have um uh uh sea level yardages and then uh here in Denver we about uh a mile high", "start": 627.959, "duration": 21.041}
{"chunk": "5280 okay so I've got 188 in the air right here now all I'm going to to manage here is really the sensation of", "start": 638.959, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "once I get into delivery what's the pressure that I'm going to put on the ball it's the same map of movement I'm just lessening the amount of energy into", "start": 647.92, "duration": 15.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "the ball and the pressure that I'm going to put on the ball so this will be it two so still a little bit more energy than I wanted to put in there but we'll", "start": 656.12, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "see what the numbers say in the air we've got 176 so we went from", "start": 668.839, "duration": 15.799999999999999}
{"chunk": "188 to 176 now we'll throw it down to a one and again these are precise so it probably doesn't look like these are", "start": 675.399, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "like crazy different from one another and that's a one energy now you notice again hopefully the golf ball is responding in a manner where", "start": 683.32, "duration": 18.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "we it doesn't look like it's moving all that far and all that much okay and in the air here we've got 174 so obviously", "start": 695.44, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "those last two numbers are a little bit too close together so this is the cool part of practicing obviously I threw too much of a wave on that particular rep", "start": 703.76, "duration": 16.919}
{"chunk": "let's dial it down just a little bit little chippy went into that Aspen see how we did I hit fairly well", "start": 711.959, "duration": 17.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "it still feels like quite a bit of wave but we'll see the number here okay great did a better job 166 in the air", "start": 720.48, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "now again just the eye test of those four balls they probably look fairly similar to one another that's what we", "start": 728.92, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "want we don't want anything that's like substantially different than the system or the golf swing that you have built but look at the difference in being able", "start": 737.839, "duration": 19.961}
{"chunk": "to command the ball 188 17 6 166 those are pretty big spreads right there but you need that at times because one you", "start": 746.12, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "want to lessen the trajectory or really the ball speed that's coming off so the apex of the ball might be a little bit less that's really good for wind shots", "start": 757.16, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "into the wind we don't want as much spin because now it starts to ride up into the wind we start to lose command of the golf ball", "start": 766.839, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "so understanding and managing the amount of energy and the amount of pressure that you're able to put onto the golf ball is a huge trait if you want to", "start": 774.32, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "increase your ability to command the ball when you're out play but it's still through the same system so one variable energy next", "start": 784.0, "duration": 22.841}
{"chunk": "variable this this has to do and this is maybe one of my favorite aspects of of this system is what we're looking for is", "start": 794.8, "duration": 15.559000000000001}
{"chunk": "to manage the face of the golf club golf club through the hit if I can't do that I can't play high level golf period if I can't control where that", "start": 802.76, "duration": 18.561}
{"chunk": "golf ball starts off just the pressure direction that I'm putting on the golf ball you are massively Limited in this game so this this", "start": 812.04, "duration": 21.52}
{"chunk": "variable is all will have to do with with um with trajectory management the launch angle that the golf ball is initially starting off now most people", "start": 822.44, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "what you'll see is if you if they want to hit it High they'll swing to the top of their swing tilt massively to get underneath it and this is how we hit it", "start": 832.759, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "high to hit it low they'll just pin this and squash it this way so look how much my body system changed in general we", "start": 840.279, "duration": 17.321}
{"chunk": "want the pelvis the femur spine ribs everything in my proximal meaning closest to my Center to be very very stable meaning that there's not a whole", "start": 848.32, "duration": 18.88}
{"chunk": "lot of Chaos in there one rep to the next shouldn't be different maybe slight amounts which we'll get into here on our third variable but very I mean to the", "start": 858.68, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "naked eye very difficult to see the differences there so when we're looking at this like we want to manage the", "start": 868.12, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "trajectory of the golf club based on so we've got a a constant here at setup constant in the in the start of the back swing and then we're constant here at", "start": 875.839, "duration": 18.841}
{"chunk": "delivery now from here if I just send the arms and the hands and start unloading early look at the dynamic loft", "start": 884.8, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "of the golf club see how the club is pitched here but look I still have commanded the face I have command over the face I'm not tumbling this thing out", "start": 895.24, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "that's the danger of going here because now if I tilt the only way that I Square it is to roll the arms now I have no face stability whatsoever so the map", "start": 903.44, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "still here guys and this is maybe our anatomy lesson for the day is through my through my rib cage if I just cut my rib cage in half", "start": 911.959, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "this way this is called the the transverse plane so it cut me in half from above and below this equator now notice when I'm just St in standing", "start": 920.839, "duration": 16.722}
{"chunk": "position this this transverse plane points out here as I stop to start to drop the pelvis more and more and more look at where the transverse plane starts to point starts to point down and", "start": 929.04, "duration": 19.999}
{"chunk": "out to where the golf ball is so the hit as as I'm as I'm dropping here the main purpose of the pelvic drop is to keer my", "start": 938.12, "duration": 19.16}
{"chunk": "trunk so now it faces the golf ball perpendicular to my trunk relatively or reasonably that transverse plane starts", "start": 948.079, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "to point it starts to point here that's why maintaining your height here is dangerous because the only way that I get to the golf ball is by lowering the", "start": 957.12, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "arms and the way that I squared is by Rolling the AR or excuse me lowering the arms and then rolling the arms through the hit so you lose the face that way", "start": 965.639, "duration": 16.841}
{"chunk": "you can hit it both directions in Crazy amounts which we don't want we want soft movers if anything so if I'm getting into into", "start": 973.56, "duration": 20.918}
{"chunk": "transition from here my job is to hit out of my chest on on this transverse plane so if I drop into into delivery", "start": 983.759, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "and I send the arms and the hands look at how now I still have control over the face but the dynamic loft is increased there so this ball should go higher so", "start": 992.759, "duration": 19.52}
{"chunk": "this will just be kind of a slower rep maybe about a two two and a half on our pace and we'll early unload it and we'll see what happens the launch", "start": 1002.56, "duration": 16.881}

{"chunk": "working through the hit what's that Loft that's presented to the golf ball obviously there it's much lower than it", "start": 1094.039, "duration": 16.0}

{"chunk": "looks like now obviously I covered a little bit too much a little bit over it right there so I tugged it okay but we'll we'll take a look at what the launch angle is obviously we can see it", "start": 1128.559, "duration": 17.12}
