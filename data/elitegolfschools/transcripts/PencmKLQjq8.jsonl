{"chunk": "today we get to talk about how to stop slicing your driver let's get right into it that's important that'ss number one right there", "start": 0.04, "duration": 17.839}
{"chunk": "that's how you D we we hear this all the time and it's a little cliche but what do people do with their driver TJ they", "start": 17.439, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "slice it badly they slice it way too much yep we'll hear that pretty a often when somebody like enters in a contact for form submission with us like hey I", "start": 25.279, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "just freaking can't hit driver and I slice the heck out of it it just drives me nuts M I hear it a ton um so why don't we talk about like the", "start": 33.92, "duration": 18.76}
{"chunk": "main like few flaws that we see that cause that and create that um I I think number one that's a really important", "start": 42.28, "duration": 18.999}
{"chunk": "topic to just talk on here is there's two different like when you get the golf club to the top yep we can move the golf club really in kind of two different", "start": 52.399, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "different directions okay so that's One Direction that's What well One Direction okay the other direction that's what I'm talking interesting okay so if the club's up here so let's say I've just", "start": 59.92, "duration": 19.72}
{"chunk": "swing it up to the top okay if I just start turning without doing anything to the golf club see where that club went yes so the", "start": 69.88, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "the club head stays very vertical on top of your hands yep exactly so I'm just turning I'm not doing anything with my arms or hands but the idea here wrong", "start": 78.799, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "map would be that I swing it to the top and I need to get back get the golf club back to the ball and one of the easiest ways to do that is right here now I'm back on it it's out in front of me again", "start": 87.24, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "okay wrong map wrong map cuz that club's not organized in a way that's going to work exactly we call it geometry just where is the club moving in space okay", "start": 96.0, "duration": 16.477999999999998}
{"chunk": "right so this would be bad geometry it's over here because I'm rotated absolutely but I haven't done anything to the club okay okay so instead of that what we", "start": 104.479, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "want to do the club from right here should actually move in the opposite direction okay it's this way yeah so this Force right right here like if I", "start": 112.64, "duration": 15.399}
{"chunk": "just let the golf club go that's the direction that we want it to go so this is the release which is psycho right like I want the ball to go", "start": 120.399, "duration": 17.602}
{"chunk": "there and I just move the golf club there huh yeah so that's going straight like out away from you on the circle path like a lot of our students have", "start": 129.36, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "actually asked asked questions about this you put a video out in the past called like angular Force right yep that's kind of what you're you're showcasing here right so this is", "start": 138.2, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "actually called so if we want to get uh crazy with this this is from Michael Jacobs so big credit to Michael Jacobs for doing this so Alphas are on this", "start": 145.519, "duration": 19.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "Vector this is a positive Alpha Yep this is a negative Alpha so the club's going in this direction a negative Alpha Force okay so so the direction that you want", "start": 155.16, "duration": 15.96}
{"chunk": "it to go in is is definitely not positive Alpha exactly it's it's negative it's negative Alpha okay yeah in this transitionary phase negative", "start": 163.68, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "Alpha okay got it people like what right okay so the and TJ brought up this the second Force which is angular here and I'll Stand right over here te so like", "start": 171.04, "duration": 17.439}
{"chunk": "right now if I've got the golf club hanging which direction is it hanging down down vertical if I just start", "start": 181.0, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "turning where it go angular Force yes out away from you exactly so think of a tether ball pole if you take the tether ball and just go W it goes this way", "start": 188.2, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "around that axis right got it okay so the the whole forward swing or like unload phase from the top of the back swing to your finish is just the", "start": 197.28, "duration": 18.439}
{"chunk": "combination of those two forces so negative Alpha and angular Force to shoot it out away from you at the same time they happen together it's not one", "start": 206.56, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "after the other they are immediate together now players might feel it in a certain sequence based on their own like", "start": 216.68, "duration": 16.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "Tendencies like somebody that gets up here and then their their immediate like idea is to just rotate here and not do anything with the golf club also see", "start": 225.439, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "another like General tendency from players is the face right now is nowhere near see it's pointing over there Y and I want it to point towards the target so they'll just go I'll take care of that", "start": 233.36, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "real quick ah right now it's Square thank goodness I see that all the time what happens then though well now I've got to go block with the pelvis so like", "start": 241.84, "duration": 17.479}
{"chunk": "extension is a great if you've heard of shallowing the golf club shallowing means the golf club is moving over here so if I extend with the pelvis now it's shallowed uhhuh so it's this late", "start": 250.599, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "extension shallow look but look at where the golf club goes so even though I got it shut early now it's just going to open like crazy from there exactly cuz I can't release it anymore I I get you I", "start": 259.88, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "get you forces like again it's just force combinations in the golf swing that just like either allow for certain things or don't allow for others got it", "start": 269.16, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "so the trippy thing here is like when I'm going negative Alpha look at where the face is pointed camera basically at the camera", "start": 277.12, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "and I don't want to hit it there I want to hit there so this is the scariest thing on Earth especially for somebody that already slices it exactly so you're", "start": 285.6, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "going to have to get over it like get over it you got to get over it but because now like where the golf club is situated if I'm turning see the direction that", "start": 292.84, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "the club is coming from it's coming from more of an inside path here and going that way which is scary too because the direction of the club is going which", "start": 302.28, "duration": 17.880000000000003}
{"chunk": "direction right to the right and I don't want to hit it there and that's the way I have to swing it now yes it's Maps yep okay so these two like if you just watch", "start": 310.919, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "this this does not look like a golf swing so if I just swing it up here to the top and just let the club go negative Alpha doesn't look like a gol doesn't look like a gol swing watch this", "start": 319.68, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "though if I go turn uhhuh and negative Alpha which will create my angular and negative Alpha together you got something that looks", "start": 327.319, "duration": 15.642}
{"chunk": "like an actual path of the golf club there yep that's it uhhuh so like if you're this guy where you just", "start": 335.88, "duration": 16.039}
{"chunk": "turn and go there miles right you'll see how much that thing is like the club is over and moving in here the the the main", "start": 342.919, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "thing we got to do is we got to change that pattern which is going to feel like the most foreign thing that youve ever done in your golf swing but you could do", "start": 352.319, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "a lot of little exercises here where we're going back swing and in general see how the shaft is fairly tall like it's not over here it's here yes I need", "start": 361.919, "duration": 17.44}
{"chunk": "it here because I need this space to operate in got it if I swing it back and it's in here you're not going to be able to go way I don't have room to move", "start": 370.72, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "right so it's fairly tall again generally tall we need to feel that negative Alpha I mean we call this windshield wiper exercise we feel this", "start": 378.36, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "go this direction and if I yep so if I go wind shield and turn my chest at the same time all of a sudden that looks more like what we see the best players", "start": 386.24, "duration": 17.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "in the world do that looks like a rehearsal when you actually go to hit a shot on the course it's like my favorite thing you just", "start": 395.479, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "go that's yeah yeah it is because where my stupid brain wants to go is there just like everybody else on the planet okay so I have to like even now I've", "start": 402.479, "duration": 17.761}
{"chunk": "been doing this since I was freaking 12 I still have to give myself these rehearsals on the golf club gets to move here as I turn my chest and that's in into impact love it so you could do", "start": 411.84, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "these like little like half swing two pieces where you just turn it's kind of tall and then feel here there love it and even there like see how that Ball's", "start": 421.319, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "starting to move tumble draw exactly we'll hopefully be able to see that on camera so we kind of see that draw pattern and once you do that a couple of", "start": 430.36, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "times like the whole purpose of a drill is to leak that sensation into your actual swing but you could do it at slower Pace setting up going I know", "start": 438.319, "duration": 17.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "where this is going to work and this kind of tall tall plane into here and turn so I'm never stopping here negative Alpha turn and hit beautiful so that's", "start": 448.24, "duration": 20.28}
{"chunk": "like I don't know 100 yards 120 yards right but that's a great way to train it at first right exactly and hopefully we can just slow that down and um I'll just", "start": 457.52, "duration": 17.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "use this one we can slow that down and kind of see just in general where that club is moving in this space and then that that", "start": 466.879, "duration": 17.480999999999998}
{"chunk": "angular force that we'll have from just rotating he yeah but the big thing again we need both forces if you just go negative Alpha and never let it go", "start": 475.68, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "that's not going to be any good no so as it's going in here as I turn it has to shoot out and around see how the golf club's going this way it's going around my spine so the combo of negative Alpha", "start": 484.12, "duration": 19.637999999999998}
{"chunk": "and angular force all is basically one motion yes gets the the energy out of the club head appropriately and honestly kind of who cares about like what the", "start": 493.599, "duration": 17.642}
{"chunk": "player's pattern is who creates this Buck slice whether this person that like Clos it down really early or I just turn early without organizing the golf club", "start": 502.44, "duration": 17.24}
{"chunk": "just understand where the club is designed to move yep right it's in that Vector already that's going toow exact yeah so if I'm going here and I turn at", "start": 511.56, "duration": 19.24}
{"chunk": "the same time but I let this energy out that's the whole freaking map dude I love it I think already that right there is going to help a ton of people um what", "start": 520.64, "duration": 16.478}
{"chunk": "I'd love to see before we kind of end this video can I see what it looks like when you Big Poppy one like obviously trying to do the same system the same", "start": 529.519, "duration": 16.482}
{"chunk": "map but what's it going to look like like sure you actually Mash one it's in that plane hopefully we can execute", "start": 537.48, "duration": 15.4}
{"chunk": "that wow so not bad I mean that's 320 carry bro so not bad at all and you don't have to like what's really cool", "start": 547.8, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "too is like when you're comboing those forces do you get like so much more out of it like it just loads up like all", "start": 556.32, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "proper systems it loads up the shaft in the right direction and so you don't actually have to work that hard uh to really execute like a a good efficient", "start": 566.24, "duration": 15.639000000000001}
{"chunk": "ball that has some Zing to it you're like oh that felt nice but it didn't work all that hard love it negative Alpha and angular man beautiful that's the whole thing love it that's how to", "start": 574.079, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "not slice your driver to not slice your driver and get it just organized um for sure last thing here and we say this at the end of every single uh uh", "start": 582.519, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "conversation that we have on on YouTube is you're going to have questions on this like especially those two forces just in general like what the heck are", "start": 591.519, "duration": 15.280999999999999}
{"chunk": "those forces um and then how to like feel them out and so as you go and work on them and practice this ask us we'd be", "start": 598.92, "duration": 15.041}
{"chunk": "happier than heck to answer like any questions that you guys have and please subscribe to our Channel we love helping you guys", "start": 607.16, "duration": 18.41}
