{"chunk": "really wanting out of honestly darn near every single player that we coach like the pelvis is what's rotating or", "start": 205.68, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "swiveing. So first when we look at like the pelvis and then the femurss the the nice thing about the the hip complex hip", "start": 214.72, "duration": 18.64}
{"chunk": "socket is that it's just two bones that are interacting with one another. So it's super easy uh to see what's going on in that region compared to the", "start": 223.92, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "shoulder. Right? So we have hips and shoulders like those are like the attachments for our extremities here. And the shoulder attachment is four", "start": 233.28, "duration": 17.319}

{"chunk": "with one another. So already way more complex. Um whereas the pelvis, we've got this like socket, right? And then", "start": 250.08, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "boom, the head of the femur just sits right in there. And so if we're talking about hip rotation, what we're actually", "start": 258.479, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "talking about is what the femur is doing inside the socket. Okay? Okay. And there's always there's two different ways to cause either external rotation", "start": 266.08, "duration": 20.28}
{"chunk": "or internal rotation. It can either be active or passive. Now, if I wanted to rotate the femur, let's say that I go", "start": 275.84, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "right here and I I don't do anything with the pelvis and I take the femur and I go internal or I go external, internal, external. I'm actively", "start": 285.52, "duration": 20.8}
{"chunk": "rotating the femur here in the socket. I could also go internal or external by actively rotating the pelvis. So see how", "start": 295.12, "duration": 17.36}

{"chunk": "patella, and I'm actively moving the pelvis. So, what's funny in golf instruction or just golf terminology is", "start": 312.16, "duration": 17.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "we'll say rotate the hips. And what we're actually meaning is we're saying rotate the pelvis. Okay.", "start": 320.56, "duration": 19.239}

{"chunk": "Yeah, J. All right. Okay. There we go. Okay. So, what this dowel is really signifying is my hip axis. Okay. So, if", "start": 340.639, "duration": 19.442}
{"chunk": "I'm right here, my hip axis right now is pointing right towards the camera. And so, when when golf instructors go rotate the hips, we're we're saying that that", "start": 351.68, "duration": 20.079}
{"chunk": "the we want this to happen, but really if I just say rotate the hips, it's like internal external rotation here, which is funny because we don't want that", "start": 361.199, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "obviously. So when I say pelvic swivel, I'm saying that the pelvis is actively rotating and we cause some amount of", "start": 370.24, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "internal or external rotation um in the hip complex, but the femurss aren't what's in my preference, it's not what", "start": 379.28, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "we're actively rotating. Like if we go up here and I'm trying to actively rotate this femur, this is external rotation of the lead femur. See how my", "start": 388.16, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "kneecap points here and then it goes whoop over here and I didn't do anything to the pelvis. What that action does is it slacks out part of the spiral line", "start": 397.039, "duration": 17.52}

{"chunk": "question if you don't mind? Does it precede the initiation of the lead spiral or is it simultaneous with it? So, uh, let's let's view this", "start": 414.639, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "differently because oftentimes when we're describing the spiral line, we're talking about the upper spiral line. So, from the bottom of my neck or bottom of", "start": 422.56, "duration": 18.319}

{"chunk": "we're talking about spirals. Okay? So, I can move let let's say that and this will be forward swing for me as a right-handed player. So, there's two", "start": 463.759, "duration": 17.68}
