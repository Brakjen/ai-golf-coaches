{"chunk": "too good where'd you feel that a lot of pressure on like the low low back exactly exactly because what it does is it shoots as soon as our pelvis starts", "start": 247.86, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "to shoot forward this way that's all extension in the lumbar okay and obviously we're going to rotate at the same time so we've got lumbar extension", "start": 255.48, "duration": 17.94}

{"chunk": "little bit of the leg action we might come back into into the trail leg okay but let's go to the Lead Foot now okay okay so if we swing it back up to the", "start": 346.44, "duration": 16.821}
{"chunk": "top again okay what will eventually happen like TJ let's show long drive patterns so big upper spiral", "start": 354.3, "duration": 17.779999999999998}
{"chunk": "there you go so see right there what already happened is this heel spun towards the target which is exactly what", "start": 365.82, "duration": 18.599}
{"chunk": "happened over here in the trail foot complex but it's it's lighter yeah okay that trail heel spun towards the target that's just because the spiral line the", "start": 375.479, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "upper spiral line leaks down into the into the lower spiral line which is all through TJ's IT band and if that keeps stretching", "start": 383.52, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "stretching stretching what it does is it just pulls pulls pulls pulls pulls there you go so there's the heel going inside ankle bone low outside ankle bone High", "start": 391.8, "duration": 17.698999999999998}
{"chunk": "got it so when we see the pressure in a lot of our favorite movers go from P1 all the way to P5 big upper spiral now", "start": 399.66, "duration": 22.2}

{"chunk": "we see that in Rory McIlroy we see that in Cameron Champ we see that in like numerous great movers Okay so one of the drills that", "start": 419.34, "duration": 19.5}
{"chunk": "personally again I dislike is this drill you see like a basket in here or a med ball seen that many times okay so I'll be here they're both slick so if I swing", "start": 428.4, "duration": 19.801}
{"chunk": "to the top and then now I'm trying to drop that Med ball what I just did is dual external rotation of the femurs", "start": 438.9, "duration": 15.539}
{"chunk": "okay I mean my femur is rotating this way this finger is rotating that way so what it's promoting If this just kept going like far on an ice skating rink", "start": 446.759, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "with that look it would promote that action there so the foot spins in that direction the foot is spinning in the opposite direction which is funny", "start": 454.139, "duration": 17.699}
{"chunk": "because from right here at the top like from P4 if I go basket drill it looks like it's what we want the sacrum to do", "start": 463.259, "duration": 15.302}
{"chunk": "which the sacrum goes that way but it's early sacral move away so that now from here as I go this way the only way to get forward is to extend", "start": 470.94, "duration": 18.179}
{"chunk": "the pelvis so now I'm going to have extension through the strikes of the sacrum is going towards the target so that's interesting", "start": 480.539, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "um when when people hear our sacred moved sometimes I've seen this in some students attempting it on their first go-around is I see them try to do it", "start": 488.28, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "like super early and see what just happened there so we have early supination now you can do that that's not bad it's", "start": 496.68, "duration": 18.181}
{"chunk": "not that you can't do that okay because you can still have in our system good movement patterns there as long as you can get the ribs", "start": 505.62, "duration": 15.239}
{"chunk": "way up here and typically what happens like when doing that is we're going to have the same type of Landing if you will it's difficult to see with like", "start": 513.3, "duration": 18.059}
{"chunk": "especially sometimes even long irons but like mid irons on down through wedges you won't see that because the spiral isn't stretching enough to really make this", "start": 522.779, "duration": 17.821}
{"chunk": "this heel flash like we're talking about yeah driver it's a bigger wave bigger range of motion a little bit so you see it more yeah exactly so you don't see", "start": 531.3, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "Rory do that with nine iron but you see him do it with driver and that's just a due to how much energy they carry into that upper spiral right yep yep and if", "start": 539.279, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "the energy keeps going wave-like then it's going to continue to move it's just like if I push somebody in a swing set if I push them with that much energy they're going to swing slow stop and", "start": 546.899, "duration": 18.540999999999997}
{"chunk": "then come back this way if I push them with that much energy they're going to swing slow stop so it's a bigger range of motion it's not like I just put energy in and then it stops up here", "start": 556.44, "duration": 18.298}
{"chunk": "understood that's wave-like so um again when it comes to that lead foot how it's planting all the way again from", "start": 564.959, "duration": 18.421}
{"chunk": "P1 to P5 go ahead and show this okay boom there's the the Lead Foot planting closer to the Target and the", "start": 573.839, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "sacrum is that its furthest point towards the Target that it ever will be in the golf swing okay because now from here if we go up into into the pelvic", "start": 583.26, "duration": 18.479}
{"chunk": "region as TJ starts to rotate now the sacrum can really work away let's actually show that from posterior view so go ahead and face me and here we can actually see better with", "start": 592.5, "duration": 20.54}
{"chunk": "the heel so let's see huge upper spiral boom and plant there you go so there's all the way to P5 so this is the furthest this point", "start": 602.16, "duration": 20.861}
{"chunk": "will be in space now go from P5 to p7 which is impact boom and you'll see now that that sacrum", "start": 612.54, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "really busted away okay that's the preferred pattern got it that's Victor hovland yeah right that's what we see", "start": 621.72, "duration": 15.26}
{"chunk": "him do as well it was great it looks beautifully so um the other thing that I think would be", "start": 630.48, "duration": 15.1}
{"chunk": "really good to talk about is this lead Famer and how it moves in the swing so go ahead and start at P1", "start": 637.86, "duration": 17.18}
{"chunk": "okay and then go all the way to P3 for me good now if you just make the transition", "start": 645.48, "duration": 16.42}
{"chunk": "from P3 to P5 there you go this actually the femur stays internally rotated and now as you", "start": 653.94, "duration": 16.579}
{"chunk": "keep rotating more and more more more this is going to go more into internal rotation the femur itself yes okay which", "start": 663.24, "duration": 18.1}
{"chunk": "sounds ridiculous because if we just had like a point in space sticking out of the kneecap you'll see this point in space allow you to go this way more and", "start": 671.579, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "more so you go well that's external rotation no okay why is that because it's relative to where our midline is pointed", "start": 680.279, "duration": 18.541}
{"chunk": "and we have like all these different like the midline we could think of it in in like the sternum and we could also also think of it like where the the belt", "start": 689.76, "duration": 16.619}
{"chunk": "buckle is pointed so this would be a good way to look at this so right now my kneecap is pointed on kind of that angle right there and everybody's is a little", "start": 697.86, "duration": 15.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "bit different right it's about right there okay and my belt buckle is pointing right towards the camera got it okay so as I move into it like Drop and", "start": 706.14, "duration": 19.859}
{"chunk": "start to work into P5 see where see where the belt buckles pointed see where this is pointed yep so now as I start to", "start": 715.56, "duration": 15.421000000000001}
{"chunk": "to drop and turn look at where the belt buckle points now yeah okay it's pointing straight towards the camera", "start": 722.7, "duration": 16.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "okay and the knee is almost pointed straight where it was at the address position got it now as I continue to", "start": 731.7, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "rotate the pelvis now all of a sudden my my belt buckle is pointing thing over here it's past where that knee is initiate address it actually goes this", "start": 738.42, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "way exactly so it's pointed here's this is really easy hip socket hip socket so perpendicular to that is here well where's your knee pointing", "start": 748.56, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "good so it is internally rotated when thinking of the Medline the midline when it comes to the pelvis okay got it so", "start": 757.14, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "the lead femur is continually working into internal rotation from P4 all the way to P9 which", "start": 766.62, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "is finish and that creates a little bit of that stretch right it's just a load just a load yeah it's just part of the Spiral line okay okay so but again one", "start": 774.779, "duration": 19.8}
{"chunk": "of the like that that ball drill that I showed earlier this drops that's externally rotating sure that's not good human movement no", "start": 784.92, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "right understood and there's part of golf swing that's not great human movement like the finished position is an extension position which is sure can", "start": 794.639, "duration": 17.94}
{"chunk": "be harder on certain joints but at the end of the day we're floating to that position right there's not a hard like muscle activation fascial activation", "start": 803.399, "duration": 18.779}
{"chunk": "lots of pressure there you're floating up to the top right so so just to be clear about this lead knee you will see", "start": 812.639, "duration": 18.421}
{"chunk": "it work this way yep just not actively working that way correct it is passively working that way okay and it works that", "start": 821.339, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "way because the pelvis is rotation makes it eventually go so it's not something you want to try to do from the top independently of everything else not in", "start": 829.26, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "our system it's going to happen as a result of how you're moving exactly the upper spot okay and the other thing that we see too when it comes to leg action is we hear this like ground reaction", "start": 838.8, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "force people are pushing off the ground hear it often yes okay you can push off the ground okay and there's probably", "start": 847.8, "duration": 15.179}
{"chunk": "Pros out there that feel push off the ground but you don't have to push off the ground in order to go into leg extension okay okay", "start": 855.839, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "so often like there's golf posture so I have some sort of flexion in the knees okay like this is more flexion this is less flexion so that's extension so I", "start": 864.26, "duration": 16.54}
{"chunk": "don't need to actively feel this okay through the strike through the strike okay okay you can but you don't", "start": 872.76, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "have to because again that picture that map in your mind can be super detrimental because if I'm only thinking about extension", "start": 881.639, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "I'm not really rotating in my mind at all now am I yeah yeah so the golf club is going to with that type of a pattern", "start": 890.459, "duration": 19.561}
{"chunk": "flash faster and that leaks into extension here and here and here everywhere it just goes through the entire map of the body so knee extension", "start": 898.98, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "is going to leak into hip extension you're going to leak into into spine extension those are anti-rotation maps yeah that's a pattern I even got myself", "start": 908.76, "duration": 17.581}
{"chunk": "into in the past like yeah kind of an actively trying to push or jump off the Lead Foot and create on all that", "start": 917.04, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "extension and the face flashes like crazy and the problem with this is like sometimes for a very short period of time", "start": 925.26, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "it's like this piece of tape that I just like okay I held it together yeah and it worked for a short period of time and then that call to action", "start": 932.82, "duration": 18.299}
{"chunk": "doesn't work anymore it actually creates massive problems in the swing and I think that sometimes is the problem with", "start": 942.54, "duration": 15.780000000000001}
{"chunk": "us as coaches is we're we're giving every word every phrase that we say is a map yeah it's a map it's a map so this", "start": 950.279, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "is why we like systems approaches because you can see why this moves again passively and you can go all the way to", "start": 959.279, "duration": 15.98}
{"chunk": "the chain of event of like what actively was like the map that made everything else move so if we can say something in", "start": 967.199, "duration": 16.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "one phrase move this way and it makes 17 things passively respond properly that'd be a pretty good map that's a much", "start": 974.88, "duration": 15.358}
{"chunk": "better map than you need to do this and this and this these are all active things cognitive things that I'm having to do", "start": 983.279, "duration": 15.142}
{"chunk": "that many things in your brain it is and then inevitably what happens is it goes clunk clunk clunk clunky positions positional right yeah", "start": 990.38, "duration": 19.419}
{"chunk": "yep yeah exactly so let's go back to this lead knee sure because it's really pretty cool so let's go from P1 to P3", "start": 1000.139, "duration": 20.419999999999998}
{"chunk": "good so no more flexion in it if anything you might have a little bit of extension in this leading so it honestly works this way", "start": 1010.399, "duration": 18.58}
{"chunk": "exactly and the reason that that happens is if you go back to P1 we've got the ribs go laterally they Bend and turn so", "start": 1019.699, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "this upper spiral is pulling up back and away and it pulls on the lower spiral and that just feels like almost straight now like there's I've lost some of that", "start": 1028.699, "duration": 16.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "bend but to do that you didn't go push off the ground no I didn't cause some other problems exactly so go to P3 again", "start": 1037.16, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "we'll finish the backswing excellent so now transition is going to be where the momentum of the golf club is going to keep going up and the ribs start to now", "start": 1045.62, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "work back here now we have more flexion in this lead knee than we started but that's because the rib system moved up", "start": 1054.14, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "here the sacrum is its fullest forward point so now if this spiral because you've got this spiral loaded now if it", "start": 1061.7, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "starts to pull up back and Away the Sacre moves away and look at what the leg responded like um extension yeah that there was Zero push", "start": 1070.46, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "off the ground no yeah so it just happened as a result of that spiral pulling back in this", "start": 1080.84, "duration": 15.780000000000001}
{"chunk": "direction like it has to move that way exactly you can't maintain that exactly okay understood exactly so those are better maps and this is why we don't", "start": 1088.34, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "talk about leg action all that often because of the pelvis system moves well and the rib system moves well then the legs tend to follow the legs", "start": 1096.74, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "tend to follow correctly and the feet tend to follow correctly but if we have these unconscious maps of like this is", "start": 1106.039, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "what works here the whole system doesn't work together I know there's many people that have that unconscious map whether it's they saw the drill somewhere they", "start": 1113.24, "duration": 15.540000000000001}
{"chunk": "saw a video and they've I've spent time doing the same drill myself where I was trying to Bank off that inner foot right I think everybody has at some point", "start": 1121.28, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "tried these things so it's nice to go back and kind of clean that map up and go okay maybe we don't actually need this 100 and for folks like watching", "start": 1129.38, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "this these little pieces of the road map will help facilitate the things that you're trying to do in your pelvis and", "start": 1137.72, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "your rib system okay so let's go like how to actually apply this like for actual swings okay got it okay so let's go ahead and hit a few here and the", "start": 1145.7, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "first one that I want you to do this is going to be a low rate of energy here okay but we're going to focus on the trail heel got it and from P5 all the", "start": 1156.08, "duration": 20.34}
{"chunk": "way to P9 which is the Finish you're going to let the heel the trail heel spin away exactly yep so it's 60 percenter", "start": 1166.1, "duration": 16.54}
{"chunk": "boom excellent and this is really cool stay right there for us notice how there is like his toes look this way right now", "start": 1175.52, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "yes he landed you're Landing almost feeling like the pressure of the pinky toe yeah right so I'm sure it's more that way right and that's the go to", "start": 1189.08, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "pattern right yes exactly so now we're nowhere heels away all day we're outside edge got it rather than Inside Edge so that's an easy way to go about that", "start": 1197.72, "duration": 16.259}
{"chunk": "let's let's hit another one now and this one will actually be focused on P1 to P5 so the load phase okay and this is a big load but I want you to notice how the", "start": 1206.059, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "lead heel now lands so at the landing position of P5 the the lead heel is going to land closer to the Target then", "start": 1215.179, "duration": 17.461}
{"chunk": "it started got it mostly because of the Spiral boom there you go and notice how TJ's showing like a little mock first to kind", "start": 1224.299, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "of get it activated like a good clear map in his mind excellent beautiful that's a beautiful way of doing that", "start": 1233.179, "duration": 18.542}
{"chunk": "okay next one we can focus on the lead femur okay okay from um all the way under the fully loaded", "start": 1241.88, "duration": 15.958000000000002}
{"chunk": "face so like as as you feel the Tre or the lead heel plant where is the the femur moving is it moving external or internal right there you want to try to", "start": 1249.799, "duration": 19.021}
{"chunk": "feel internal internal yep because of that that's internal rotation of the femur okay and femur again what point is", "start": 1259.46, "duration": 15.06}
{"chunk": "that for people who don't know yeah femur is this big bone right here this bone right here from knee to hip so we don't want to feel as we're planting here that the femur goes that way", "start": 1267.559, "duration": 16.860000000000003}
{"chunk": "exactly and a lot of people will focus on the knee see the knee where it goes so you can focus on where that knee is", "start": 1275.539, "duration": 15.721}
{"chunk": "continually pointed at P5 so it's pointing inward external right exactly exactly and now for for some folks", "start": 1283.7, "duration": 18.539}
{"chunk": "because there's a lot of mobility issues that people have on their hips you might feel both there's a plant and now as you turn out of there you might feel this", "start": 1292.52, "duration": 17.421}
{"chunk": "this is a supination action again supinate and rotate that way yep that's fine you see a lot of guys on tour do that land and then boom all the way up into", "start": 1301.46, "duration": 20.08}
{"chunk": "the finish this spits out and rotates away that's okay yep others like you you've got loads of mobility and like", "start": 1311.36, "duration": 15.900000000000002}
{"chunk": "sure this whole like it band spiral line glute Mead but I mean maybe this helps so it helps like when I first started trying this I did not see that same", "start": 1318.86, "duration": 18.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "Mobility yep and I would see my heel Flash in this direction now that there's a little bit more Mobility I've been doing the pattern for a long time those", "start": 1328.52, "duration": 16.141}
{"chunk": "things go away and that starts to happen yeah exactly and with big waves yeah you're probably gonna see some especially drivable for sure like you'll", "start": 1336.98, "duration": 16.859}
{"chunk": "see guys like Patrick Patrick Reedy D weights the Lead Foot like driver it's in here and then when he hits it boom that comes off the ground because all", "start": 1344.9, "duration": 16.980999999999998}
{"chunk": "this is working up back and away and that's fine because that's just the force being created right it's just a force exactly it's not like he's trying to push off of there again to make that", "start": 1353.9, "duration": 17.459}
{"chunk": "happen it's just a responsive Force got it based on his pattern so anyway to get to get back to the exercise here femur as I go ahead and land in a P5 I want to", "start": 1362.059, "duration": 17.761000000000003}
{"chunk": "feel like it works there you go and what's really cool teach yeah this is the exact look that you had was focused", "start": 1371.24, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "on the lead heel the first time sure what's great is it's the same map but a different way of explaining the map to yourself and every single person is", "start": 1379.039, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "going to have a little bit of different way of recognizing the system and feeling the system and visualizing it yeah so you could focus femur knee feet", "start": 1388.1, "duration": 19.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "heels pressures yeah all that is fine as long as it's like again a response in the system exactly exactly totally okay", "start": 1396.86, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "so let's show one more with that uh that lead femur or lead knee it's kind of all one part of like the same type of system in the legs boom there you go so this is", "start": 1405.2, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "an internal feel all the way from P1 to P5 foreign okay last one let's go back to the trail side and we're going to focus on this", "start": 1414.62, "duration": 17.381}
{"chunk": "lead knee and what I want you to focus on is one once we land a P5 as your as you're rotating all the way through the", "start": 1425.36, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "Striking to finish this knee doesn't get to go forward at all it's it's going to as I start to rotate in my ribs my pelvis the whole bit this knee is going", "start": 1433.1, "duration": 20.339000000000002}
{"chunk": "to stay underneath underneath me here so the knees kissing if I drew kind of an imaginary line just", "start": 1442.7, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "off the midline yeah mid do you think that this knee would ever really cross that I would like to see it not so you'd like to see it more or less work yep", "start": 1452.48, "duration": 16.980999999999998}
{"chunk": "exactly and look at what that heel did spun away okay exactly so so we're missing ain't a very good looking all right nope exactly that's that's knees", "start": 1461.36, "duration": 17.099}
{"chunk": "kissing right that's banking like you were talking about yeah okay that's pronation of the foot got it all again in our eyes unhealthy patterns", "start": 1469.7, "duration": 18.180999999999997}
{"chunk": "understood yep so on this one I'm going to feel my knee never cross that line even feel like it almost Works away from it yep exactly and most people it'll never cross that line like all the way", "start": 1478.94, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "to delivery some people will get to the top and then it immediately starts to cross we don't see that one because that's such an early extension look but", "start": 1488.24, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "a lot of people will get to delivery and then it starts to flow and again back through impact here you'll see that one a lot exactly and you'll feel it in your", "start": 1496.46, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "pelvis a ton and look at the spine angle and you'll feel it here like that lumbar pressure that you felt before so again that they only spinning leaks into", "start": 1504.38, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "pelvis keeps me more underneath dual hip flexion got it that keeps you in a flexion state for longer beautiful okay", "start": 1512.299, "duration": 16.001}
{"chunk": "so this knee TJ's knee never passes his midline there you go beautiful stays Underneath Him", "start": 1520.28, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "beautiful and look at how that move looks super similar to the first move then that your Trail heel responded", "start": 1529.96, "duration": 16.538999999999998}
{"chunk": "beautifully yeah yeah pretty sick and what's cool too now like if you're watching PGA Tour players because there are extension tilt patterns out there", "start": 1537.86, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "there are flexion rotation patterns watching what a person's feet do will help you provide the keys of like what's going on the pelvis what's going", "start": 1546.32, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "on their ribs I bet you can tell what Scotty Scheffler is now yeah okay sure no like disrespect", "start": 1554.779, "duration": 15.598999999999998}
