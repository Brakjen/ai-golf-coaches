{"chunk": "club exactly and look at that so now the shaft shallows sure stupid word it's just where the center of mass is in", "start": 453.24, "duration": 15.32}
{"chunk": "space compared to where the Hub path is okay and they move in opposition for our favorite players like if you look at havland his hand path is like whoa in", "start": 461.24, "duration": 21.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "and then goes over a bunch but if you watch where the the center mass of the club goes in transition he has one of the biggest Loops uhhuh right this shape", "start": 471.56, "duration": 19.319}
{"chunk": "here because he has one of the biggest shapes in hands in hand path okay but they're mooving opposition I see and that's part of the reason why he's one", "start": 481.56, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "of the most stable guys on tour because his hands get so far out here that now my elbows are in front the center of mass is behind have all this room right", "start": 489.759, "duration": 19.081}

{"chunk": "mean the club face is like is stable compared to somebody that has more lead arm adduction and Lead shoulder extension M okay so now I've got my", "start": 507.68, "duration": 18.358999999999998}
{"chunk": "elbows pinned back here you'll see every player here extend in the pelvis like with the with the pelvic rotation and then the golf club gets kicked over here", "start": 517.599, "duration": 17.24}
{"chunk": "so the hands now are getting thrown out and you'll even see some players like the golf club looks like this like now that the center of MK gets back here", "start": 525.839, "duration": 17.841}
{"chunk": "yeah and the hands are out here so it's like this like weird yeah kick cuz they might have the the idea of like okay let me get the club left", "start": 534.92, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "around me which is okay you got the club left around you force is just make it do it and you'll see so many guys on the Range like okay I got to get it inside", "start": 543.92, "duration": 17.559}
{"chunk": "here and they're just totally screwed because now I can't control the bottom it's always going to be an upward hit kind so never compr yeah that's General", "start": 553.2, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "stuck stuck means that the club's not behind you it means the hands are behind you oh okay hands are in front club Behind that's not St oh dude it's in", "start": 561.279, "duration": 17.001}

{"chunk": "see let's see a havland esque pattern so this will be outside of yours because you're in like super neutral range sure so I got to exaggerate it a little bit Yeah so I want you to really focus on", "start": 577.36, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "the hands being in and then they're able to go out in transition yep and then you just hit it right okay okay let's just mess around", "start": 586.519, "duration": 21.28}
{"chunk": "with it go big hin here yeah controlling the Hub and what's really interesting is it probably still felt fairly stable", "start": 596.279, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "through there it did feel very stable through there okay now don't you dare try to like flip it or anything like that and like do anything crazy okay", "start": 606.959, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "okay so we're not trying to lose the face at all understood but let's work the Hub in the opposite direction so it's out to in and hit okay okay so you", "start": 615.04, "duration": 18.759}
{"chunk": "could think of this as like hand path under rather than Hub under EX exactly so you're you're still controlling the hands you're not trying to do anything", "start": 624.44, "duration": 17.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "to the center of mass yep so big old loop with with the hands big one big loop with the hands SC I can do that yep did I do it it's well yeah", "start": 632.959, "duration": 20.36}
{"chunk": "absolutely Lo Loop for sure absolutely what did it feel like through the strike prob felt different it felt different yeah well number one I hadit a", "start": 645.959, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "little fat but it felt less stable definitely with the face EX exactly and the fat is always going to be there te because as soon as somebody goes here to", "start": 654.48, "duration": 18.521}
{"chunk": "get this looping under where where what am I going to do in order to to help that go under now the exactly so now the Bottom's all whacked and as soon as you", "start": 664.04, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "rotate and there's another reason people extend in the pelvis is just to try to thrust that forward and catch the ball right there's a general block yeah I see", "start": 673.44, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "right that's also why it's it can be kind of Speedy like you can hit it okay distance um but my gosh you're never", "start": 681.2, "duration": 16.96}
