{"chunk": "up te what up dude pretty excited cuz today we get to talk about how to release the golf club let's go let's", "start": 0.12, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "go we're talking hand things Forum things yes sir Club face things mhm we're talking release yes yeah one of", "start": 13.519, "duration": 16.682}
{"chunk": "our I'm very curious about it and one of our most um asked for topics to kind of dive deeper into sure absolutely I think", "start": 22.88, "duration": 15.559999999999999}
{"chunk": "what would be great is you know if you're familiar with our Channel or it's the first time you've ever watched us we we coach in this systems based approach", "start": 30.4, "duration": 18.2}
{"chunk": "meaning that systems have bookends to them where there's space in here that would be adequate right like this is where we want to be and then if you run", "start": 39.64, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "out of that book end you're in fville right again it's more difficult to hit good shots over here um and then the same thing on this end so I think", "start": 48.0, "duration": 18.400000000000002}
{"chunk": "what would be nice is to maybe explain both of those bookins okay and then players can decide based on their own preferences what they need because of", "start": 57.92, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "body movement sure what they need for speed what they need for precision they can like pick what type of release", "start": 66.799, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "pattern is going to match best for them so why don't we start it um this like almost in a way kind of fully un", "start": 73.52, "duration": 19.798000000000002}
{"chunk": "unloaded phase or area which is um really about like so p7 is impact p8 is where the shaft gets leveled to the", "start": 83.439, "duration": 15.841000000000001}
{"chunk": "ground on the other side yes exactly and then if we even go like one step further where the the golf club the shaft goes out of the ribs on this side I mean the", "start": 91.64, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "sexy thing that everybody talks about especially on social media is almost the club face pointing back at the camera yeah all right let's start here okay let's please", "start": 100.24, "duration": 20.24}
{"chunk": "do that because I'm curious sure well I want to hear your thoughts too te like I know you've been studying this stuff a lot especially like in release M so not", "start": 109.92, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "every high level player throughout the course of history has done that and then if we go one step further this yes yeah", "start": 118.88, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "very few have in history done that the great players I agree Okay Age like you see more of a release if you could like through those ribs again where the the", "start": 127.2, "duration": 18.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "toe is rotating beautiful that way more like we see like the Leading Edge is right in here and the toe is pointing on the on", "start": 137.04, "duration": 18.92}
{"chunk": "the plane line rather than the face pointing on the plane line and when you're talking like rate of rotation everybody has this rate of rotation", "start": 147.08, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "simply means is how aggressively is the face rotating through the through the Impact Zone and you know now we're talking about like well low rate of", "start": 154.16, "duration": 18.359}
{"chunk": "rotation is a really good thing it can be it can be for sure it can be catastrophic as well sure if implemented poorly so you don't have to have this", "start": 163.319, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "sexy look of the face pointing back towards the camera once like it goes through the rips like not a necessity yeah and in fact we coach this", "start": 173.36, "duration": 19.96}
{"chunk": "yours doesn't neither does mine yeah well I I I try like hell to make do it but it doesn't do it but when we're playing no it's not it's not like I'm", "start": 183.04, "duration": 19.56}
{"chunk": "forcing this to go that way right yeah exactly so like if you look throughout the course of history we got these great players Woods Y for the most part", "start": 192.799, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "rotates it rotates it a bit uh you got these other guys Jimmy Walker uh rotates it even more rotates it even more John Ron through there rotates a heck of a", "start": 202.36, "duration": 18.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "lot right so it is not this huge necessity that we have a low rate of rotation it can be great for some folks", "start": 211.319, "duration": 17.8}
{"chunk": "but it can again it can like limit speed it can limit all these different items that we really need as as if we want to call ourselves golfing athletes like we", "start": 220.319, "duration": 15.519}
{"chunk": "want that stuff to feel good when we play agree okay so why don't we start with like that into the Spectrum so kind of the the tiger end of the spectrum", "start": 228.519, "duration": 18.441}
{"chunk": "exactly and by the way even though we're talking about this point in space Yep this is not necessarily going to be an active thought to get there to put the", "start": 237.159, "duration": 17.4}
{"chunk": "club there sure it's going to happen as a result of other forces passively because of another type of an idea so if", "start": 245.879, "duration": 15.959999999999999}
{"chunk": "you just swing one up to like P5 is like all the way into P5 good this is about delivery fully loaded phase from right", "start": 253.04, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "here to do this what we'll want and by the way from here with every single player we'll have some amount of of vertical from the the center mass of the chest and the center of mass of the", "start": 262.4, "duration": 17.997999999999998}
{"chunk": "pelvis okay and what that's going to allow for is this lead arm to lower and as it's lowering now all the forces are going", "start": 272.039, "duration": 17.002}
{"chunk": "down you'd have to really go up and away to create that space there you go and now the flash out is this mhm okay so", "start": 280.28, "duration": 15.238999999999999}
{"chunk": "notice when you when you do that TJ if you can do that again for us so this lowers your unwinding and and rotating", "start": 288.12, "duration": 18.001}
{"chunk": "this there you go so if TJ from over here lowers this arm and lets it continue to go eventually the humoris", "start": 295.8, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "is rotating like right here in the shoulder socket it is rotating this bone is going this way not because he's actively trying to make it like externally rotate but it will externally", "start": 306.52, "duration": 21.318}
{"chunk": "rotate for every single player on earth to some degree now how early it happens because of shoulder flexion is what", "start": 315.919, "duration": 19.522}
{"chunk": "we're talking about okay so for that type of player um you'd have this lowering sh flexion action and then that external rotation", "start": 326.52, "duration": 15.360000000000001}
{"chunk": "would happen very very early for that type of player earlier exactly and then maybe I'm getting ahead of myself but if we're bouncing to other end of the", "start": 334.6, "duration": 15.599}
{"chunk": "spectrum we call it like maybe hland yep right then he's got a little bit more internal for this early portion and then", "start": 341.759, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "that'll go later yes and a lot of that is is based on the center mass of the pelvis and where it's moving so like with Rory heavier face rotation kind of", "start": 349.759, "duration": 17.441000000000003}
{"chunk": "a guy like with driver you'll see Rory through the strike look like that like it really goes so the center of mass of his pelvis like is as he gets into P5 or", "start": 358.72, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "so let's take Rory vers havin at P5 cuz two different releasers from right here Rory will rotate in the center of mass", "start": 367.199, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "of the pelvis will be further forward through the strike to unload this and so as he's rotating meaning his pivot point", "start": 374.759, "duration": 15.399000000000001}
{"chunk": "is further CL more bias into the lead side not all the way here but more like lead HIIT bias for Pivot Point meaning he's rotating in this phase this can", "start": 382.919, "duration": 20.401}
{"chunk": "lower and as it lowers the force that we get is this external rotation of the of the upper arm as he does that and", "start": 392.72, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "that'll rotate the face a little bit more aggressively okay and so that type of a release in the hands will be more", "start": 401.24, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "into a radial versus owner release so think of a hammer right load the hammer unload the hammer so as I kind of lower", "start": 408.0, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "this club down with shoulder flexion or this would be extension yep um then the release is more of this idea and you", "start": 417.599, "duration": 17.0}
{"chunk": "want and and the player won't even have to feel this it just happens it just happens but we'll have two main like", "start": 426.599, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "active thoughts there for that type of a player once I'm in five yep okay the the pivot point will be further lead hit", "start": 434.24, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "bias right so as he's as he's unwinding as TJ's unwinding he's rotating here and the other active thought is this lead arm will lower and so you'll you'll have", "start": 442.759, "duration": 20.16}
{"chunk": "these like guys that talk about um like lowering the arms heavily like if you if you watch a bunch of Justin roses um he's talking about lowering y yep he's", "start": 452.639, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "talking about lowering here and then as he's rotating he's in here so Justin Rose Rory both have very similar tops of", "start": 461.919, "duration": 15.001000000000001}
{"chunk": "Swing look there's not a whole lot of bow in this lead wrist in fact with Rory quite a bit of extension yeah interesting compared to other players", "start": 469.36, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "sure right like havland who has a heck of a lot more bow yep exactly so that's another portion portion of the matchup", "start": 477.08, "duration": 16.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "for release is what type of player are you at the top also how do you grip it like moreaa weaker grip yep Bose it", "start": 485.28, "duration": 20.4}
{"chunk": "heavier at the top Rory stronger grip yep more radial at the top with the with the load in the hands in the wrists", "start": 494.56, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "interesting so all this goes into release release patterns it's like all the set some of the setup in the arms and the hand and how we're holding the", "start": 503.599, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "golf club all the way into the load M right and then how how the player pivots is really key to this too because if I", "start": 510.68, "duration": 16.038}
{"chunk": "pivot more like Rory where I'm up in here the tendency is going to be now I'm going to lower this and as I lower it and continue to rotate then that flashes", "start": 518.519, "duration": 19.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "out so te if you could let's set up uh next to it here and show us a couple like this needs to be done for release like for this to passively release we", "start": 528.519, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "need enough energy in it for it to actually go okay so go to five for us and again the two active thoughts here", "start": 537.68, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "are going to be lead hip pivot and Lead arm lower and just bust it through here there you go do that again roughly", "start": 544.68, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "to five okay and go good now are you trying to rotate the arms at all or rotate the", "start": 553.68, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "club face no no I'm not yeah so that happens because there is a rotational aspect that we're talking about in the", "start": 560.92, "duration": 15.559000000000001}
{"chunk": "pelvis okay and we're more lead HIIT bias there okay and go ahead and do that again from face on now if you could teach so we'll go to five and then the", "start": 569.44, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "same map good do that again good now as the athlete do you", "start": 578.56, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "feel the club releasing in a certain way like does it feel like it ro ro like I do feel it rotating more um CU I have a", "start": 588.2, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "pretty good sense and awareness of of what that's doing um but yeah I do feel it rotating a little bit more but it's not like I'm sitting here trying to yes", "start": 597.12, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "to like throw it that way exactly and so I think it would be really important like right now to discuss this and we can kind of Bounce this idea back and", "start": 605.839, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "forth a stable release in our minds in our Maps is a player whose structure of", "start": 613.32, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "the arms meaning the humorous bones okay are not going over one another this is like not very stable like now we're now", "start": 621.72, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "we're act yeah exactly so that would be un exactly the other unstable release would be if I go here way too much see", "start": 631.24, "duration": 17.601}
{"chunk": "I'm I'm actively moving these like that's not stable either like does the golf club look like it's anywhere near neutral yeah and either to kick anyway", "start": 640.24, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "exactly it's going to go anyway because I got to recover it late like you got we got issues now sure right and if you watch like our Instagram or you know any of like the shorts that we put up of", "start": 649.0, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "some of our players our job as coaches is to push the intention for certain movers into one of those types of feels", "start": 657.72, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "but what truly happens is neither one of those we want neutral yeah yeah yeah so stable simply means that the arm", "start": 666.44, "duration": 16.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "structure throughout the course of the Swing we're not really we're we're not messing with that", "start": 674.839, "duration": 15.001}
{"chunk": "yeah whether the arms lower here and I'm and I'm a lead hip bias pivot pivot kind of a player the arms are still out in front of me here and we see a ton of", "start": 681.959, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "players like falo through history is look just like this right and then like the other type of a hit which we'll get into here is more of a lower and this", "start": 691.399, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "Abad hit but the arm structure still is nice and sound we haven't messed a whole lot of with that right what we're talking about more is like the rotation", "start": 700.2, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "that we see in the hands so this pronation and superation type of an act but I'm still not messing with the upper arms totally no no this is fine uhhuh", "start": 710.16, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "from turning with it still have the golf club structured sure that's stable so rate of rotation is simply reading the", "start": 719.68, "duration": 15.360999999999999}
{"chunk": "rotation of the club face and how active it is Rory heck of a lot higher than havin than havin yeah but you argue with", "start": 726.72, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "me who's the better ball Striker that's a hard one yeah that's a beer conversation right Roy's better no", "start": 735.0, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "hain's better like that that's why that's why spectrums is so important because these guys arguably would be our", "start": 742.72, "duration": 15.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "bookends right havin super low RAR rotation macroy a little higher but both insanely good ball Strikers because the", "start": 749.76, "duration": 16.358}
{"chunk": "by our definition of stable at this point they both fit that criteria exactly exactly their arms aren't doing anything like whack and crazy especially", "start": 758.959, "duration": 15.081}
{"chunk": "through the hit yeah right yeah yeah exactly so let's hit a couple balls that way te if you could and you don't have to stop at five we'll just keep it going but we've got our two active thoughts", "start": 766.079, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "which is more lead hip bias pivot okay and then the the lead arm is simply lowering when you're doing that you'll let the golf club just", "start": 775.519, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "go feel it rotate more yeah that one kicked a bit for sure mhm yep by the way lead hip is not that I'm taking this", "start": 787.16, "duration": 15.4}
{"chunk": "lead hip and just driving it towards the target yeah it simply means that the Pivot Point would be in here and so I'm rotating okay yeah I think I was kind of doing that there a little bit oh do you", "start": 795.32, "duration": 18.8}
{"chunk": "feel that in yours okay good there you go excellent excellent so there's still rotation in a lead hit pivot right it's not not that I just sway this over here", "start": 804.24, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "and never rotate cuz if I just keep moving this lateral there's no rotation a pivot point means that there's something rotating around that point in", "start": 813.399, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "space and what we're doing we're going to one extreme which is a lead hip type type pivot which we see some of that", "start": 822.519, "duration": 16.12}
{"chunk": "right one more of those yeah one more of those so probably what you'll feel and again it's not like you're trying to flash the club but that passively", "start": 829.32, "duration": 19.278}
{"chunk": "happens because of an active idea and what is interesting though like um I don't I don't feel it like kick right here uhhuh it actually still feels", "start": 842.32, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "relatively stable to hear and then it kicks late yep and so like and again personal to the player what they actually sense like if we put a a a you", "start": 852.04, "duration": 19.998}
{"chunk": "know a sense like we put hack motion y on on your hands we we would see that happen right at probably a higher rate", "start": 861.519, "duration": 16.482}
{"chunk": "through the hit but you'll sense it at different times based on each individual player which would be really cool for players to kind of mess with which is", "start": 869.8, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "great okay so now we'll uh we'll go to havin Spectrum okay which we we talk a lot about havin okay for a lot of", "start": 876.88, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "different reasons blah blah blah okay so let's go to five again all right and here here we go again with what's actually going to happen we're going to shove the Pivot Point back in", "start": 885.959, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "here so this lead hip is going to go towards the screen and then away from the target and this lead arm this elbow try to take and just move it towards my", "start": 895.199, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "hand there's the ab hit this is abduction this lead humorous came off of T TJ's PEC and moved in this space so", "start": 902.959, "duration": 17.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "he's not looking to lower the golf club down to find the bottom out there because if he's if he's up here and he pivots here right now I'm going to go", "start": 911.48, "duration": 19.199999999999996}
{"chunk": "this way to control the bottom out okay and control the release if I'm up here and then this is the Pivot Point I'm moving I'm I'm in essence I'm moving my", "start": 921.56, "duration": 18.598}
{"chunk": "Center amass my pelvis forward so I can lower this to control the bottom out okay two different releases there lead hit pivot is going to be an arm lowering", "start": 931.199, "duration": 16.602}
{"chunk": "action and Trail hit pivot is going to be a level hit action yes exactly exactly so let's start with that and then we'll get into the passive release", "start": 939.44, "duration": 15.478000000000002}
{"chunk": "which is in the hands okay so go to five again for us and we'll do a p well actually yeah you can hit this one okay just go to five now we're going Trail", "start": 947.199, "duration": 15.122}
{"chunk": "hip pivot and Lead arm goes across there you go good yeah way more stable too yeah yeah yeah yeah interesting right so and when", "start": 954.72, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "definition of stable right there you go the face was was rotating less yes so both are stable yeah exactly that TJ's", "start": 966.04, "duration": 16.318}
{"chunk": "just inferring to the rate of rotation in the club face he'll feel it like feel it like almost never rotate you know", "start": 974.279, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "like meaning that the face isn't tumbling this way totally yep okay um hit us another one like that but one one", "start": 982.0, "duration": 16.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "constant motion okay into to five Trail hit pivot and Lead arm across level hit different and like when you're", "start": 989.0, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "watching this just to the naked eye you'll see the differences m in both of those different patterns and again the", "start": 999.36, "duration": 16.84}
{"chunk": "thing is like notice we don't either is great like again we got", "start": 1007.16, "duration": 19.919}
{"chunk": "tiger he was kind of good okay yeah and obviously like there's more to to like his greatness I mean great putter great mind great short game right but we would", "start": 1017.04, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "also put tiger in a great ball striking C category because stats talk about it unequally yeah he was number one in uh I", "start": 1026.48, "duration": 16.241}
{"chunk": "think Strokes gained approach or irons one of those categories for a number of years something that wasn't matched", "start": 1034.28, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "until um Scotty Sheffer of this past year who also has some of that going on absolutely but then throughout the course of history we got Lee trino we", "start": 1042.24, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "got Y and we got havin who I mean that guy hits it unbelievably well Meo and like all these guys like anybody that plays on tour neeman's on a heater", "start": 1051.0, "duration": 18.119}
{"chunk": "neeman's on a heater I mean shoot shooting 59s and 60s is pretty darn good all right right so like you see these different release patterns so like who", "start": 1060.4, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "in the heck is to say that one is better than another M like again it's a bar conversation you're sitting there arguing with your buddy over preferences", "start": 1069.4, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "at this point yep okay okay so who I think it' be good to just explain like what type of a player yeah each one of", "start": 1077.44, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "these like you can f fill these buckets with different types of players so um players that are searching for distance okay okay would be lead hip", "start": 1086.24, "duration": 20.079}
{"chunk": "pivot and arm lower guys interesting if you watch every single long drive athlete they are all that type of a", "start": 1095.76, "duration": 15.521}
{"chunk": "player they extend earlier the club face the radar rotation is nuts and they they have the ability to get into these crazy", "start": 1103.72, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "swing speeds because of that right like like if I'm going to um really lower the arms right I can also meet that with a vertical force and exactly there's a lot", "start": 1111.76, "duration": 18.197999999999997}
{"chunk": "of power in that exactly and talking with K RS who's our strength and conditioning coordinator for for our Academy the first thing he does with our Junior players is just teaches them how", "start": 1121.039, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "to jump yep so that's vertical Force how to lower how to go up which is funny because we think a golf is being just rotation turn more", "start": 1129.679, "duration": 18.761}

{"chunk": "rotation in the pelvis and that really this is a different conversation but that's really because of the upper spiral line what we see the ribs doing to influence that but you'll feel okay I", "start": 1202.32, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "can have this release I can have that release those are both rotary the pelvis is is Rotary there it's not going side", "start": 1212.12, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
