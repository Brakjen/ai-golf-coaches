{"chunk": "go hi what's up dude this this one gets misconstrued extremely extremely yes", "start": 14.08, "duration": 20.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "now S1 okay so TJ sacrum and see1 are just stacked up would you say you're in any amount of like substantial side Bend", "start": 24.64, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "right now not very substantial no I mean very minimal there might be just a hair of it just because my right hand sits lower", "start": 35.2, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "than my left yeah but so we might see like a yeah like a little baby but it's it's I'm not sitting here going like this yeah for sure yeah yeah exactly so", "start": 43.719, "duration": 17.281000000000002}
{"chunk": "right now we would say TJ is in Fairly fairly neutral spined when it comes to lateral Bend you might have some amount of flexion State blah blah BL but that's", "start": 52.0, "duration": 15.839000000000002}
{"chunk": "a that's a different look when we're talking lateral Bend or side Bend we're always talking in this lateral perspective this way this but if I just load this", "start": 60.359, "duration": 20.32}
{"chunk": "way like this distance increases both in a vertical and in a lateral Direction because of the shape of the Spiral it's", "start": 69.439, "duration": 17.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "this okay now it made TJ's chest rotate and we'll see in here the C and t-spine will start to bend slightly in here but", "start": 77.799, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "down in here nothing nothing so very very stable in the lumbar exactly we would Define as Poor Side Bend would be", "start": 87.079, "duration": 17.481}
{"chunk": "this action here okay and what that is is all we're doing in the golf swing is we would shoot the pelvis", "start": 96.2, "duration": 19.08}

{"chunk": "elpine okay and the the health the health problems with that are like the the elpine is designed and way to go into flexion and extension States if we", "start": 114.399, "duration": 17.241}
{"chunk": "throw extension uh flexion and extension State along with lateral Bend that's where it gets hairy real quick so it's too much", "start": 123.0, "duration": 20.279}
{"chunk": "substantial pelvic lateral movement that then def like now we're going to get into the pivot of the spine in the L spine to work in the lateral Bend to", "start": 132.64, "duration": 17.041000000000004}
{"chunk": "rescue the club and Slot it which again to show that I would look like this goes uh lateral and it rotates see how the", "start": 141.48, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "golf Club wants to go out here so I've got to rescue the golf club this way so now we can see where the L spine is bending to rescue the club to slot it", "start": 149.64, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "here okay so if I just drop to some degree in this like transitional phase and then I start to Upper spiral drive", "start": 157.28, "duration": 18.598999999999997}
{"chunk": "right now I look in here now people think that looks like a ton of side Bend and it's not it's just I have way more flexion state in this Trail hip compared", "start": 167.36, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "to where I was before see it's gone here and now I've rescued yes so the point being", "start": 175.8, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "maintained hip flexion does not correlate to side Bend or more of it actually it it actually correlates to less side Bend healthier pattern and", "start": 184.799, "duration": 20.521}
{"chunk": "definitely like what we want is ideally zero side Bend for health reasons in the elpine which is the point of this video because most people look at side Bend", "start": 195.64, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "like they correlate too much side Bend to health problems and they're both right and they could be wrong it's just where that side bin happens and then", "start": 204.68, "duration": 16.959000000000003}
{"chunk": "again thresholds throughout the entirety of the spine the point is is just in the c-spine and the t-spine you can have way more of that threshold and still be okay", "start": 213.519, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "like think of like a tree like the top of the tree can do this stuff all the time but you do too much of that down here and you break your freaking tree over okay similar to how the spine is is", "start": 223.239, "duration": 19.48}
{"chunk": "made up not exactly but good way to look at it got it okay so let's hit a shot here te where", "start": 232.079, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "I'd and this will look like substantially like more than what you'll see out of everybody on tour but this", "start": 240.439, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "will be just this like Drop now stay dropped and that same idea of back chain through the strike where you just maintain the hip flexion like you'll be", "start": 248.64, "duration": 16.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "like old man mode like this way through the H and just chippy one out there 50 to 100 yards got it good let's face the camera again and", "start": 257.0, "duration": 19.561}
{"chunk": "just hug that shaft again for me please I show back chain in the away okay all the way to like rotated", "start": 271.0, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "here there we go so this is the back chain State well if you have the upper spiral driven movement here you would look more in there and that that lateral", "start": 279.6, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "Bend here in the T and C spine is what keeps TJ's head more centered rather than like way off the ball so in essence like what I'm saying is let's keep this", "start": 288.639, "duration": 17.680999999999997}
{"chunk": "like hip this hip flexion here as the upper spiral keeps driving there so this moved slightly", "start": 297.36, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "very slightly laterally okay let's do the same thing in the forward Direction so if we're maintaining this hip flexion as this now goes into there we go so see", "start": 305.24, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "that that shape right there see where TJ shape went in the c-spine and t-spine there's this Bend in here and then it's like safe Ville in the L spine because", "start": 314.88, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "there's hardly any bend down there if any there we go got it yep okay okay let's maybe take a look at this from", "start": 323.8, "duration": 16.039}
{"chunk": "like face on as well thing if you can just hug okay and then show back chain dominance in the away and then where", "start": 332.44, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "would that that lateral Bend be if any there we go see where TJ's head goes It goes more back into like that centered look let's do the same picture on the", "start": 340.08, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "other side there we go now let's see just a combination of both of those like upper spiral movements as well as like the the", "start": 348.039, "duration": 19.16}
{"chunk": "maintained hip flexion beautiful look look through there okay what would the away swing look like good beautiful okay let's go ahead", "start": 357.72, "duration": 20.04}
{"chunk": "and hit one kind of at that energy level that you just showed and you're just kind of chippy one out there for us but biggest thing is the maintained", "start": 367.599, "duration": 19.08}

{"chunk": "hit you just stay dro this won't necessarily look like a a tour golf swing cuz we're missing like the the energy in the upper spiral to pull you into", "start": 387.52, "duration": 17.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "finish there we go beautiful beautiful that right there is proper", "start": 396.199, "duration": 16.721}
