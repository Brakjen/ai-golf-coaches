{"chunk": "your version of the goat TBS that's that's mine too come on I mean he's really good it's hard to argue tiger always talks about his number one asset", "start": 34.0, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "being his mitts like what he does in his hands and my theory is is because when he's talking about his hands he's always talking about like he's managing the", "start": 43.6, "duration": 18.519}
{"chunk": "golf club and how he's moving in space you're managing the club face blah blah blah blah blah so this whole video", "start": 52.68, "duration": 15.600999999999999}

{"chunk": "this is radial owner deviation so if you hear us say Rd Ral deviation oler deviation load the hammer unload the", "start": 84.24, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "hammer radial and ner Bingo okay extension and flection extension would be this action here where you feel like", "start": 93.72, "duration": 15.039}
{"chunk": "the Palm goes away from you and flexion is here correct okay then we've got pronation and superation think of superation is holding a cup of soup", "start": 101.68, "duration": 17.799}
{"chunk": "pronation is the other way so obviously we're holding the golf club so we can do a number of these different actions yep and a combo of all these actions and", "start": 110.479, "duration": 20.522}
{"chunk": "every single golf swing has a combo so it can be fairly complex if you're just looking at like", "start": 120.52, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "all the different combos of movements that you can have however there's some preferences that we have yes okay so let's start with this we'll just do this", "start": 128.52, "duration": 17.878}
{"chunk": "together a where we're holding the golf club straight up and down and you'll notice that when we're doing this the the Leading Edge of the golf club is straight up and down as well if we just", "start": 137.319, "duration": 18.921}
{"chunk": "threw Rd radial into the system we would ride that that Leading Edge up this like imaginary vertical wall a bit okay now", "start": 146.44, "duration": 18.92}

{"chunk": "face goes wide open so we need the face or the Leading Edge straight up and down exactly now this is the load of the golf", "start": 174.36, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "club so we're throwing it vertical and horizontal while still management managing the Leading Edge mhm okay now if we did that like more curved", "start": 182.8, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "off we're there now you threw a little bit of the unload which is nice but this yep yep so see how it's up right now for both of us correct to unload it we would", "start": 192.0, "duration": 18.52}
{"chunk": "have the golf club like another imaginary wall right here the Leading Edge would ride down that imaginary wall and then would be thrown back to the", "start": 202.0, "duration": 17.639}

{"chunk": "vertical first we're here there there you go so just show the load first who now unload boom there you go that's", "start": 219.56, "duration": 20.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "really what the hands are doing to control the club face right now again if we walk through that I'll just do it without a golf club and you go ahead and show it with a club radial", "start": 230.76, "duration": 19.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "extension only there we go now this action here because I'm in extension this is a superation pattern uhhuh", "start": 240.239, "duration": 15.559}
{"chunk": "because I'm an extension this is suating now yeah cuz you're getting the forearm involved going so and you can feel like both of these like bumps here what that", "start": 248.319, "duration": 16.641}
{"chunk": "is is your radius this is your owner the head of the radius and the head of the owner so if you get that going down feel they go that way there we go that's where that superation so this is", "start": 256.68, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "superation right mhm so if I'm here this looks like oler okay but I'm not doing that I'm an extension and going here so it rotates the form that's that's superation leaks", "start": 266.12, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "into that one exactly and then we would go into flection to unload there we go Bingo okay so what's interesting like in", "start": 275.44, "duration": 20.521}
{"chunk": "in motoring this the the active and again it's the correct amount so you don't need a ton you don't need a little you need the right amount for", "start": 284.72, "duration": 18.76}
{"chunk": "your system active movement radial extension supination that's all active the flexion should", "start": 294.08, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "almost happen because the flexion is me rotating it throws the energy out of the golf club and that rotation from the chest leaks through the arms through the", "start": 304.32, "duration": 15.677999999999999}
{"chunk": "hands and out through the golf club so this loaded position because Alex is rotating shoots the energy out and now", "start": 312.199, "duration": 16.402}
{"chunk": "you see how that that wrist responded yeah okay so in learning this instead of just holding it straight up in front of you let's go ahead and set up to a golf", "start": 320.36, "duration": 15.278}
{"chunk": "ball and now just show me from setup mhm with no rotation here we're just going to show the load phase so we would have", "start": 328.479, "duration": 19.201999999999998}
{"chunk": "radial and extension so now that golf club's over here on your Trail side correct now as we're throwing this supination pattern you can really see it", "start": 337.56, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "from this look here see how the Leading Edge of the golf club is just riding down this like imaginary wall yes and you're not trying to run it into the golf ball here it feels like it's just", "start": 346.16, "duration": 15.478}
{"chunk": "going to run almost right into your ankle yeah it go straight yeah exactly so the combo of the rotation of the the chest and the supination P action of", "start": 354.039, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "this Trail wrist go ahead and start rotating the chest is what gets us here mhm there you go so hit us a little Chip", "start": 362.039, "duration": 15.681}

{"chunk": "rotation at the correct time that's when we're going into supination yeah so we're here", "start": 378.199, "duration": 15.321}
{"chunk": "there yep hit us just a little chippy shot out there like that flu motion yep yep yep but there's no chest rotation in the back swing so that club is going to", "start": 385.68, "duration": 16.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "come up here and then back and around copy there you go that's a really good way to train", "start": 393.36, "duration": 15.678999999999998}
{"chunk": "yourself on how we're moving the golf club in space now the three pieces of of the golf club", "start": 402.28, "duration": 15.761}
{"chunk": "like when we talk about geometry like where the golf club should be moving in space we've got Hub which is just the connection point of the hands on the golf club okay so right there yep okay", "start": 410.28, "duration": 20.079}
{"chunk": "the center of mass which is just the balance point of the golf club and then finally just the axis that the shaft is spinning around which is face like", "start": 419.919, "duration": 20.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "controlling the face yeah okay and what we would prefer to see is a face that is slightly like if it airs it's a little", "start": 429.44, "duration": 19.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "bit more closed than open okay okay and the reason being is if we've got the face shut over here I can just motor the chest into the strike and now I have a", "start": 438.84, "duration": 17.079}
{"chunk": "balanced out face if it's open and I motor the chest that doesn't match that ain't going to work exactly so I've got to slow this down to", "start": 448.56, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "catch this up and that's a heightened rate of rotation in the club face which means more chance for like big moving shots which ain't that fun okay so let's", "start": 456.639, "duration": 19.682000000000002}
{"chunk": "look at this again go ahead and set up to it please yep okay and let's make this instead of like boom boom we're going to buff it off just a little bit but we're going to stop at the load", "start": 467.0, "duration": 17.998}
{"chunk": "phase leading edges vertical and vertical see that improper would look like this that way yeah Club up towards the", "start": 475.159, "duration": 18.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "SK Club face more up towards the sky exactly exactly so we would like to see the Leading Edge of the golf club roughly on the same plane as Alex's", "start": 485.039, "duration": 16.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "spine angle that address that's a big one I see people the misconception is this has kind of always traditionally been square uhhuh but if we're talking", "start": 492.879, "duration": 19.401}
{"chunk": "how it's relative to the spine angle it's open so now you've already introduced some of that pronating to", "start": 502.879, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "square it off so a feeling of shut it's really Square relative to spine angle and that's the key to everything exactly and this like really cool thing that", "start": 509.44, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "like everybody's hunting for go back into that same position you were at just like through the load good if this starts to work down so we're suating go", "start": 519.76, "duration": 16.959}
{"chunk": "ahead and start rotating the chest okay as you keep turning turning this look right here is like the most popular thing in the world now you don't have to", "start": 527.839, "duration": 15.480000000000002}
{"chunk": "be here like John ROM look like that right super stable at the strike but this is a Telltale for for great face stability and I guarantee you the club", "start": 535.399, "duration": 19.961000000000002}
{"chunk": "back here looked like that right it didn't look like that not too many guys or any guys here and then all of a sudden they're going exactly exactly", "start": 545.56, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "that's just a WIP cut yeah that's the fun one feel very good yeah not not playable yeah exactly so let's let's hit", "start": 553.48, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "a couple more shots just like that Alex and like the first one was pretty big movement let's just do it kind of gentle in the hands like even there like have", "start": 562.24, "duration": 16.401}
{"chunk": "all the fingers just stay like the pressure from the the lead pinky finger into the into the pad stays like kind of firm there you go so now we've got it", "start": 570.6, "duration": 16.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "stable in the hands okay and show us that same shape and just marry in that chest rotation at the appropriate time", "start": 578.76, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "beautiful beautiful now that was a little wipy there right uhhuh so what we want to do is just throw in the correct", "start": 587.24, "duration": 16.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "amount of closure in the face so we need a little bit more pronation in the back swing cuz pronation is this action and", "start": 594.48, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "it's we're just talking degrees here see it's not affecting like this point in space is is your anticubital faucets the opposite side of your elbow notice when", "start": 603.16, "duration": 17.317999999999998}
{"chunk": "I'm doing this that point in space isn't changing so I'm not throwing this yeah you're not going no I'm not going there I closed it yeah it's we're talking", "start": 611.959, "duration": 16.842}
{"chunk": "degrees it is so season your steak the right amount right the proper amount of closure with the same shape in your mind", "start": 619.56, "duration": 16.399}
{"chunk": "there we go I got to feel more shut there exactly okay yep so just go there again okay now a really good exercise", "start": 627.88, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "for you this is just going to work straight down this there you go as you turn there's impact got it there's your map doesn't that feel different going", "start": 636.639, "duration": 17.840999999999998}
{"chunk": "into the strike way different uhhuh way different okay so let's execute on that there we go so much better not", "start": 645.48, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "wiped okay the bottom out was a little right just slightly heavy so that's like the easiest thing in the world to effect just move your divot forward big wh and", "start": 653.399, "duration": 15.520000000000001}
{"chunk": "I think that's a really important thing like even with this exercise and even me is we're just judging we're using the ball to judge okay what went wrong with", "start": 662.2, "duration": 16.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "the movement so you go like you just said let's move your divot up okay so the intention is really good here move the divot up yeah and let's trial and", "start": 670.2, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "error now exactly exactly that's what we're going to try and do is okay basically is it a past fail do I get this part down and can I the divid up", "start": 677.68, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "right so now we'll just see if we can rubber meets the road here that's right beautiful right I would say that was a little better and that's better", "start": 685.56, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "right so you go okay that's a good rep let's try and rinse and repeat for the next however long exactly exactly so now that one's good so this is like a really", "start": 693.56, "duration": 15.681000000000001}
{"chunk": "good way to just educate the hands as tiger would say on how they're controlling the instrument now what we're really working on right here", "start": 700.56, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "Holmes is the transitionary phase and through the hit that's always the hardest part okay so this shape Woo is", "start": 709.519, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "transition cuz you don't see anybody on on tour right who starts right here and goes great back swing yeah right the golf club still needs to like Arc fairly", "start": 718.24, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "appropriately in the back swing we prefer it to just gently ride up the plane okay but let's do this in a way like when we first set up and we can do this", "start": 727.72, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "again Alex's midline it's a super self-explanatory term it's the middle of him go figure mid and it's a line that would just cut him straight in half", "start": 736.24, "duration": 18.758}
{"chunk": "imagine that as being this like sheet of glass that just come perpendicular out of Alex's sternum right out where the golf club is right", "start": 745.959, "duration": 17.402}
{"chunk": "now so when he is riding this up with Rd it's riding up his midline plane mhm so the back swing would simply be this", "start": 753.72, "duration": 15.879}
{"chunk": "let's go ahead and turn this way go ahead and start rotating the midline to face the camera and this goes with it now we've got the golf club arked and I", "start": 762.519, "duration": 18.68}
{"chunk": "could now make the same shape vertical and it goes over here as it keeps going this way what's the chest going to do", "start": 771.6, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "there's the hit yeah so all that we really had to do to make this look just like a golf swing is set up really nicely let's go ahead and move the", "start": 779.639, "duration": 16.601000000000003}
{"chunk": "midline and the arms and golf club are fairly passive so this is interesting too because I don't have to actively run the arms back anymore that would break", "start": 788.279, "duration": 18.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "your sheet of glass we're talking about that would break the sheet of glass now the swing falls apart falls apart right because the golf club it's designed to", "start": 797.76, "duration": 16.359}
{"chunk": "swing up and in here this is its design and look at like how he would waggle boom yeah he was always doing that boom", "start": 805.04, "duration": 15.08}
{"chunk": "little circles feeling the same same exact thing so we want that same pattern but I've got to be able to move the instrument over here there's my midline", "start": 813.24, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "rotating because the chest is rotating and now I could make the same shape here there yeah so let's see it now we got", "start": 821.959, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "some maps so the sequence of movement is chest rotation very passive with the arms and hands now you'll keep rotating a bit but we're going to let this start", "start": 830.519, "duration": 18.401}
{"chunk": "to work up and shape off there you go see how the yeah yeah and it's just the appropriate amount we don't need too much we don't need too little we need", "start": 840.04, "duration": 15.921000000000001}
{"chunk": "the right amount so season it up so it tastes really nice mhm so it's this turning and then like you said yep the", "start": 848.04, "duration": 15.8}
{"chunk": "club up and then that shape right we're just making that little shape here and at the appropriate time turning back into the golf ball yeah okay really", "start": 855.8, "duration": 19.04}
{"chunk": "passive let's see all that here there beautiful what's super interesting too so passive back here in the transitionary piece and", "start": 865.04, "duration": 18.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "I was going to say that for me oh the more I push that way it always feels like forever uhhuh and I always love to", "start": 874.519, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "go there's no laying down which makes so much sense because when we're here and the ball's there a quick to have the golf club go this way is like super", "start": 883.199, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "counter why do I want it to go farther but I want to hit the ball now exactly so it's a bad MAP and most", "start": 893.0, "duration": 16.639}
{"chunk": "people have that map yeah you're not if you're not even thinking about it and you're just sitting here going well the quickest way from A to B straight line", "start": 900.399, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "exactly and so this this goes back to it so if you go ahead and set up okay most people go well the golf club should work away from the target well I'll just run", "start": 910.04, "duration": 16.198}
{"chunk": "it away yep got that done yep so as soon as that happens it's back here the golf Ball's back there you want to get it back here so the circle really is in an", "start": 917.759, "duration": 19.442}
{"chunk": "opposing move move it's this is the circle that you're creating rather than the golf club working here so that's a totally totally different map for most", "start": 927.8, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "players yeah but what's really nice is we're we're marrying in like almost three different systems a little bit of what's going on in like the big like", "start": 936.92, "duration": 17.078999999999997}
