{"chunk": "line exactly exactly so then when we're actually just going to hit the putt we're only focused on one thing and that's the pressure on the ball that control the speed got it okay so let's", "start": 193.76, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "start with roll and we'll do this te let's let's do this from facing the camera Okay so the dynamic Loft and like", "start": 202.56, "duration": 18.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "how the golf ball is interacting with the tool with the Putter and the hit is the most important piece here and what", "start": 211.92, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "we want is two real items number one most Putters are somewhere between 2 and 5 degrees aoft when you when you purchase them got it okay which is fine", "start": 218.799, "duration": 22.12}
{"chunk": "okay number two what we want is an angle of attack that's appropriate to roll the ball okay so let's start with like if I", "start": 229.76, "duration": 17.161}
{"chunk": "have a wedge and I hit down on it that creates a dynamic loft where I'm going down so I create more friction this way against the ball mhm okay it would", "start": 239.12, "duration": 16.199}

{"chunk": "putter rather to slightly Ascend into the ball and I'm talking slightly I mean I'm talking a degree or two but it just", "start": 254.799, "duration": 16.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "slightly yep so let's imagine like a bike tire right here that's that's in front of my Center okay and if I'm swinging my arm from this lever here and", "start": 263.0, "duration": 19.479}
{"chunk": "I hit that bike tire on that usend there goes the bike tire immediately roll if I put the bike tire back here and I'm descending on I'm just", "start": 273.0, "duration": 15.641}
{"chunk": "going to squish it in the ground it's going to bounce up right so no rolling there I see I see okay and that bottom out is always going to be underneath the", "start": 281.52, "duration": 16.879}
{"chunk": "sternum so from the sternum the ball should be placed 2 Ines in front of that sternum Point how do you classify what", "start": 288.8, "duration": 16.921}
{"chunk": "two Ines is like one ball yeah one ball roughly yep exactly so if we're here and this is good mirror work for folks you just stand in front of the mirror you", "start": 297.6, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "look at the mirror and go okay there's where my sternum line would be okay the ball is slightly ahead of that got it cuz now the club is descend descend", "start": 306.479, "duration": 17.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "descend bottom out Ascend Ascend Ascend so now I'm going to ascend without even having to worry about it it's just ball placement got it but then number two", "start": 314.24, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "again most Putters have two to five degrees of Loft we want a slight forward lean in the shaft and that forward lean should be the the", "start": 323.0, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "grip of the putter being right over the top of the golf ball at a dress so now I'm taking a putter let's say that my putter has four Dees of Loft I lean it", "start": 331.96, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "here now it has one or two degrees of actual Loft got it so if I've got one degree of Loft with an upward hit of one", "start": 339.919, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "or two de that ball one could actually get airborne slightly which is fine but the ball is immediately tumbling so when", "start": 347.36, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "it hits it just got it right okay so this is super easy we have a ball that's 2 in in front of sternum with a forward shaft lean of a couple of degrees said", "start": 355.8, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "that the grip of the putter is right over the top of the golf ball from the face on lens like that'd probably be more right about here for that angle", "start": 365.72, "duration": 17.96}
{"chunk": "perfect got it got it okay so fairly simple okay now we don't have to worry about roll anymore so that takes care of", "start": 376.479, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "roll mhm hit one force okay you know where this putts going I think it's going to go to the right a little bit let's go ahead and hit it yep", "start": 384.44, "duration": 18.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "beautiful good you can almost hear it too te that was fair like right off the ground or right off the bat you'll hear it kind of purr yeah uhhuh exactly now", "start": 397.0, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "the longer the part if you get into like 60 ft the ball still should actually get in the air slightly cuz you're hitting it so hard you're hitting it so hard it", "start": 407.52, "duration": 15.198}
{"chunk": "still has one degree aoft with an upward hit it's going to get in the air a little bit a little mhm I he exactly okay okay so we got roll okay next", "start": 414.919, "duration": 21.162}
{"chunk": "intended line all right few things that go into this but in essence like if you're holding the PN just hold it straight up in front of you just like you would like let's hold it like a six", "start": 425.0, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "iron like I'm going to rip it okay okay so right there you're holding it primarily in the fingers correct okay so", "start": 433.8, "duration": 15.881}
{"chunk": "and it almost sits underneath the pinky pad like we have two pads here there's mey pad here mey pad there y th pad pinky pad so full swing sitting", "start": 442.16, "duration": 18.16}
{"chunk": "underneath the pinky pad that's exactly right right okay and what's the reason for that uh well it gives you more maneuverability in the hands you can", "start": 451.52, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "hinge unload the golf club do things with your hands leverage that thing hit that thing right it's up in the Palm you can't do that as much exactly okay okay", "start": 459.639, "duration": 16.761}
{"chunk": "and what it does like the more that the shaft sits down it sits on this path this Arc so if I swung it on this Arc", "start": 467.8, "duration": 16.719}
{"chunk": "see how radically the face would open and close to the Target it'd be square to the path yes but now you would have", "start": 476.0, "duration": 15.161}
{"chunk": "to be so precise with your ball position cuz if it was slightly forward that Ball's going left if it's slightly back thatall right there you go so the ball", "start": 483.08, "duration": 15.879}
{"chunk": "position just a little bit off in your setup and then that really makes it hard to roll down your line exactly so if I have it in the fingers and I set up to", "start": 492.159, "duration": 15.161}
{"chunk": "the golf ball the shaft angle is down right and I've almost got like two different two different planes I have my forearm plane which is fairly vertical", "start": 498.24, "duration": 15.999}
{"chunk": "okay and the shaft plane that's fairly with more horizontal than that so one plane here one plane there exactly so if I just hold that thing up and I just", "start": 507.52, "duration": 16.281}
{"chunk": "even if I use the hands just slightly we can see how much the face opens and how much it would close without even trying to like superate and pronate right right", "start": 515.64, "duration": 16.679}
{"chunk": "so problem right it's harder to get it down your intended line that way yes so instead if we let the the really and I think the easiest way to to to better", "start": 523.919, "duration": 15.641}
{"chunk": "understand this and feel this we want it to sit in the LIF line which is right underneath the the thumb pad if you hold the putter right up in front of you and you let the weight of the putter fall", "start": 531.92, "duration": 19.919}
{"chunk": "until the grip catches in that thumb pad now we're there there you go so it's right in here Bo just catches right on there and you'll see a different droop", "start": 540.92, "duration": 19.001}
{"chunk": "right like from my forearm plane into the shaft plane there's a bow here this way rather than their six", "start": 550.76, "duration": 18.84}
{"chunk": "iron yep yep which is Absolut like everybody nobody sets up with a neutral wrist everybody has some amount of oler", "start": 559.88, "duration": 15.24}
{"chunk": "when they're setting up to six iron the same's true with with putter if I let that Dro and fall down if I take that off see thater shape rather neutral", "start": 568.16, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "y yep so you'll still have owner but the error if you're going to error is more of a bow in this shape where I have more", "start": 576.44, "duration": 15.079}
{"chunk": "owner as the handle is sitting into the thumb pad cuz now the handle's higher the shaft is higher right so now if I use just like an extension of flexion", "start": 584.959, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "look the the face is so much more stable to the Target on a gradual super gradual Arc rather than the radical Arc from", "start": 592.839, "duration": 15.122}
{"chunk": "like underneath the pinky pad and the fingers right okay so let's just hit one from there", "start": 601.6, "duration": 16.961}
{"chunk": "good you're pretty good oh really got to protect the lead light so we've got that", "start": 610.76, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "particular posture but or or that particular look in the handle but then posture is really important with this as well so the more that I have a a", "start": 620.6, "duration": 16.52}
{"chunk": "retracted look in the in the scaps so the scaps are getting closer and closer to my my spine right that way okay it leaks to spine extension and the thoric", "start": 628.72, "duration": 18.079}
{"chunk": "and and c-spine okay and so now in posture I would look here right see how like flat my back is yeah problem doesn't feel right exactly and plus you", "start": 637.639, "duration": 17.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "don't have anywhere like the more I retract my arms sit on the sides so I have nowhere for them to swing and now you're you're totally using this", "start": 646.8, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "rotation in the spine and in the ribs and the more that I do that now the face is going to open and close substantially to the to the Target not to the path but", "start": 654.92, "duration": 16.239}
{"chunk": "you're setting up the path to be very radical sure so we need heavy almost to like complete scat Pro traction around", "start": 663.36, "duration": 20.081}
{"chunk": "you right like bare hug mode the more you do that the more the t-spine moves into flexion and so there's a ton of Round right in here in TJ's t-spine", "start": 672.68, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "which is beautiful because when this is flat okay and it won't be completely flat to the ground like level to the ground here but it's a heck of a lot", "start": 682.88, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "closer and in this space like if you go ahead and hold it right in that in that lifeline and I'd love to see it just a tiny bit higher now we'll see like where", "start": 691.92, "duration": 18.919}
{"chunk": "that shaft plane is going through TJ's t-spine here that this is darn near perpendicular to the shaft's plane got", "start": 701.2, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "it which is great now if you just swing around that plane and let the putter just freely release that ball is going to start down", "start": 708.76, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "your your intended line every time that look looks a hell of a lot like Nicholas by the way it does right he just has like crazy side Bend to like getting that like crazy look but part of the", "start": 717.16, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "reason why Nicholas was such a great putter is are these principles that's beautiful okay so oh that was hit so", "start": 726.24, "duration": 15.12}
{"chunk": "nice feel that that was hit great yeah so the more that we scap protract as well these don't actually do this but", "start": 733.16, "duration": 15.437999999999999}
{"chunk": "the look is that they internally rotate they don't actually internally rotate relative to the scaps and the shoulder but what we will see if you face it face", "start": 741.199, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "camera for us here teach so and I'll take your putter for from you okay scap retract okay so the opposite side of the", "start": 749.279, "duration": 20.28}
{"chunk": "elbow is the anticubital FAA that is pointing right here right now now let's just see what happens to this anticubital when you go into heavy scap", "start": 759.16, "duration": 18.08}
{"chunk": "protraction see how the anticubital all of a sudden starts to point in here mm so we have this it almost looks like I could stuff a beach ball right in here correct and it's not because you're", "start": 768.639, "duration": 16.0}
{"chunk": "trying to do anything crazy and the humorous they're neutral but these elbows are quite a ways away from one another now got it so now in here", "start": 776.92, "duration": 17.081}
{"chunk": "there's all this room now let's go down the line okay see this space in here now your arms have all this free room to", "start": 785.36, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "swing underneath your rib cage got it which is freaking beautiful so don't move the rib cage just swing each arm", "start": 793.56, "duration": 15.961}
{"chunk": "from the shoulder socket to and fro there you go okay so when TJ's swinging here if I", "start": 801.68, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "have a a lever here and a lever here The Swinging look looks like this so see how there's no chest movement right now zero", "start": 810.12, "duration": 20.601}
{"chunk": "like when when folks go like rock the shoulders or rotate the chest yes does that happen but it's a", "start": 820.0, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "passive response because the only reason that they that responds that way is because you have a dual point of of contact on the grip like as soon as I go", "start": 828.92, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "here see this then I go here so my hands look like this right", "start": 838.6, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "because this is a swinging point this is also a swinging point there you go so if I have them connected now and I feel the same thing it looks like the chest", "start": 845.56, "duration": 20.439}
{"chunk": "rotates and it does but it's responding to that look so there's not a lot of like active going on in the chest it's mostly just this picture of swinging my", "start": 855.6, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "arms freely underneath my chest swinging Point swinging Point really in putting we'll have one additional swinging point which we'll get into here in a sec when", "start": 863.759, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "we talk about distance but this is a swinging point and this is a swinging Point okay a great way to feel this too is like if you're cradling your phone", "start": 871.8, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "like the phone's pointing right up right up towards me now just rock that phone to and fro got so soft in here and I just swing", "start": 881.24, "duration": 20.081}
{"chunk": "that there you go beautiful beautiful and we'll see how the phone when TJ's swinging this it like slightly arcs but", "start": 890.6, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "it's very very gradual see that so now think of the face of the putter being perpendicular to that phone and how it would Arc go ahead and swing the putter", "start": 898.56, "duration": 18.319}
{"chunk": "now with the same sensation look at that putter now see the face does it open and close relative", "start": 908.199, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "to the Target yeah absolutely yes but it's very gradual so how easy is it to get it down the line now oh filthy", "start": 916.759, "duration": 18.161}
{"chunk": "better yeah and what's nice is like now we can release the putter fully M right we don't need to block it down the line", "start": 925.24, "duration": 15.039000000000001}
{"chunk": "at all sure but now we can talk about General releases here which is going to help us with distance so just to recap intended line we've got Lifeline grip", "start": 933.0, "duration": 21.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "okay which if anything we're going to error where the there's there's a difference in the angle from the shaft of the form and that this bow is in this", "start": 944.079, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "shape rather than in this shape okay number two is the protraction state of the scals which creates this flexion state in in", "start": 952.48, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "TJ's t-spine and so from there if his arms just swing very freely underneath him it's like the easiest thing to get the golf ball starting off on the on the intended line that was beautiful what a", "start": 961.319, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "great look okay okay last piece and we talked about this in one of our previous videos", "start": 970.72, "duration": 15.120999999999999}
{"chunk": "when we're talking about the difference between distance wedges and full wedges is this like the difference between like a proximal to distal Outlook compared to", "start": 978.12, "duration": 18.56}
{"chunk": "distal to proximal Outlook got it now now just to Define distal distal distance for this distance away from you so that' be my hands my", "start": 987.0, "duration": 17.799}
{"chunk": "fingers okay proximal is the center mass of me that's the most proximal state right above my belt buckle got okay so", "start": 995.56, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "in full swing we have a proximal leaking to the distal because we're looking to tissue load and then it leaks out into the golf club and shoots all that energy", "start": 1003.48, "duration": 16.279}
{"chunk": "out and it feels freaking awesome okay putting we don't need all that tissue load cuz like even if you have a 50 or", "start": 1012.24, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "60 footer wasn't the last time you like wound up on a putt hopefully you're not sure right so", "start": 1019.72, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "we need an unbelievable sense of the hit in the fingers and in the hands got it so putting really is the lever is in", "start": 1028.12, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "here and we see this out of like my some of my favorite Putters again looking at like Nicholas Palmer uh Ben khaw khaw", "start": 1038.12, "duration": 19.241}
{"chunk": "yes oh dude just melty like you'll see the handle like almost stay underneath the player in here like hitting a 5ft", "start": 1047.72, "duration": 16.64}
{"chunk": "putt why would I want and need to rock my shoulders why wouldn't I just go here makes more sense that way I mean it's", "start": 1056.36, "duration": 15.158000000000001}
{"chunk": "simpler yeah yeah so hit one there's a there's an old hole right here TJ okay let's hit one where it's just from the hands like you're going from extension", "start": 1063.799, "duration": 17.162}
{"chunk": "to flexion with the trail hand to just kind of pop it out there a bit okay great now what I'd love to see like like there's a little block there mhm the", "start": 1073.0, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "release can be in here so see how the putter can pass", "start": 1081.32, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "there which is cool because like let's let's equate this like and and loads and unloads in your wrist is like crazy so cuz I could like load a club by going", "start": 1088.88, "duration": 20.8}
{"chunk": "super Nation to Pro Nation load unload m i could load unload radal radial to owner I could load unload extension to", "start": 1098.88, "duration": 18.64}

{"chunk": "Hammer if I'm hitting if I'm hitting a nail it's all in here like how much is the elbow moving but I can hit that freaking nail like perfect and whatever", "start": 1117.559, "duration": 18.641}
