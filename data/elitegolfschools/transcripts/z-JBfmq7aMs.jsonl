{"chunk": "okay we got another one this is great because again we we talk so much about the load phase which is from again in", "start": 22.8, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "our minds from P1 to P5 okay what we don't talk a lot about is from P5 what the heck do we do from there sure by the way the reason that we", "start": 29.82, "duration": 17.279000000000003}
{"chunk": "stop talking right in there is because from like P 2.5 to P5 there's like I don't know 90 things that happen so it's like really important to", "start": 39.059, "duration": 19.74}
{"chunk": "organize that area because if we organize really nicely to P5 it just makes it so much easier to hit a golf ball from there without really even", "start": 48.78, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "having to worry too much however we still see people that screw it all up even if they get into P5", "start": 57.78, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "really nicely they just don't know what to do from there and I think a lot of that maybe they've learned a map in the in the past that doesn't quite jive with", "start": 65.4, "duration": 15.899999999999999}
{"chunk": "where they currently are like maybe they've learned to do this little forearm rotation action yep I learned that when I was a junior this little shake the hand drill right exactly so if", "start": 73.56, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "you're trying to do that and all of a sudden you even get yourself into a better load position yes you can still screw it up you can still screw it up nine ways to Sunday like it's it's just", "start": 82.2, "duration": 19.14}
{"chunk": "it's really important to have a map from there how do I move through that unload phase all the way to finish which is", "start": 91.2, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "kind of this like P9 sure phase got it uh this is a good picture this is important because there's this this is the start of the of the unload phase so", "start": 98.759, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "I'm turning turning turning if I were to helicopter the golf club out of this window at like a 45 degree angle like", "start": 108.9, "duration": 15.481000000000002}
{"chunk": "away from the target sure and up away from the ground like on this angle in 3D space it would go through the same window in space every single time so if", "start": 116.28, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "you were to actually Huck this thing your helicopter that direction yep exactly the same window every single time got it that's the finish of the", "start": 126.06, "duration": 17.999}
{"chunk": "unload okay yep it's important to understand that so how this really works we're going to talk about this idea of a dual fulcrum system", "start": 134.459, "duration": 18.901}
{"chunk": "okay so teach come on in here and you can kind of be our our shower yes we go to P5 okay we have two fulcrums and I'm just", "start": 144.06, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "gonna we're gonna use one big lever for right now so let's take the trail arm off okay we're gonna have two points in space", "start": 152.76, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "this lead shoulder complex okay and the lead hand complex okay this is a fulcrum meaning that like any any joint in our", "start": 161.28, "duration": 19.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "body can move that point in space is a lever see how this can unload right here so I can load", "start": 171.66, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "it I can unload it okay okay this point right here you can load and unload so I'm going to take the club away from you so this would be kind of a loaded phase", "start": 179.04, "duration": 18.060000000000002}
{"chunk": "show just no no body movement here just an unload just an A B duct hit there you go so see how this is a point in space that the whole system is swinging from", "start": 188.64, "duration": 20.599}
{"chunk": "okay so if we go back into this I'll be the shower now okay this would be a single fulcrum where I'm not going to load or unload this system at all I'm", "start": 198.739, "duration": 18.521}
{"chunk": "just going to swing this system so which one can I put more speed into this system or if I loaded this system", "start": 208.62, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "now definitely if you loaded that system exactly the hand system correct yes the hand system so in the wrist joint", "start": 216.54, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "complex like this area right here we have a pivot sure and we can do a lot of different things in here but in essence I can load it see I have angle here as", "start": 224.34, "duration": 17.518}
{"chunk": "soon as I loot it lose angle that's unloaded okay okay got it so what people will screw this up is they will do a", "start": 233.819, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "number of different things because of the map in their mind so hop back in here for us let's go to P5 nicely", "start": 242.819, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "so a lot of people that we see see this face right now is pointing in this direction yeah so it's well away from the target correct wouldn't it be easy", "start": 249.959, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "to just get it back on the target line right here so now I've thrown the club oh great now I have the face on the Target in my mind", "start": 258.72, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "yep that's a map that I'm now now freaking I'm good okay well where are all the forces going when I do this", "start": 267.66, "duration": 17.398999999999997}
{"chunk": "out down and out right so to create space and not just stick it in the ground right here yep what would you have to do with your body", "start": 275.52, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "extend and everything works up so we'll see guys drop do all this great stuff into P5 try to get the golf club going", "start": 284.46, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "or the face back on the target line and now all of a sudden I have to create space and they just screwed up the whole system so they get into P5 here yep and then", "start": 292.979, "duration": 18.661}
{"chunk": "kind of in a rush to get the face down Square to the Target line we'll throw it this way yep we'll just try to get it onto the target line right there yep and", "start": 302.28, "duration": 18.659}
{"chunk": "now you kinda have to do that through the strike exactly and now they just just whacked out this whole dual fulcrum", "start": 311.699, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "type of a system okay because they threw yeah so let's let's show it in a rope and we can probably slow this down sure", "start": 320.72, "duration": 15.58}
{"chunk": "go ahead and just hold that so it's roughly like a little bit shorter than just a normal golf club and again we'll do this from face on okay okay and just", "start": 329.4, "duration": 20.1}
{"chunk": "lay it on your back for a backswing good now just whoosh it away from right there", "start": 338.58, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "okay now that is thrown away this way okay so you can see that TJ do that one more time", "start": 346.4, "duration": 17.139}
{"chunk": "okay go ahead you can see that most of it is just thrown directly from yes this furthest point away system meaning this", "start": 355.199, "duration": 20.461}
{"chunk": "is a this is a lever point in the hands I can load and unload this system just on its own that would be a single fulcrum system okay very much speed in", "start": 365.88, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "that just that no okay okay so instead let's put it up over the top of your your uh Trail shoulder again so in order for TJ to do this by the way", "start": 374.52, "duration": 19.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "you can see the hand complex load he's got some amount of Rd there's some lead wrist flexion like this all loads up right here you can feel that now go", "start": 384.36, "duration": 20.34}
{"chunk": "ahead and just zip the chest and yeah exactly and let the hands follow that they'll unload secondary there you go", "start": 394.68, "duration": 17.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "there you go where is the unload happening in your mind yes out at like P infinite it's like way over here it's", "start": 405.24, "duration": 18.601}
{"chunk": "not down here kind of what you were describing like if you're going to helicop in a golf club it all happens there way late you wouldn't attempt to", "start": 414.9, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "helicopter the golf club from P5 to p7 no you wouldn't it just doesn't feel straight in the ground you throw it straight in the ground it just would like stall out the whole freaking system", "start": 422.94, "duration": 15.78}
{"chunk": "okay you gotta create space light blah blah it's just a bad MAP but I understand where people are coming from because they're just trying to get the friggin racket the face back like on the", "start": 431.4, "duration": 20.22}
{"chunk": "Target or hit got it this feels like a hit it's a very early hit but in people's minds sometimes that's the map", "start": 440.639, "duration": 16.861}
{"chunk": "sure okay so the main fulcrum that we have the the first the leading the primary fulcrum is in the shoulder", "start": 449.4, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "complex these are hitters okay like I'm I'm hitting hard here with the arms first okay the secondary", "start": 457.5, "duration": 18.54}
{"chunk": "right the following unload is in the hand system okay okay so what I would like to see this is just a good map that people should have go ahead and hold on", "start": 467.22, "duration": 16.858999999999998}
{"chunk": "to the golf club again I'll take your real friends flimsy shaft away okay let's go to P5 boom good here's what people need to", "start": 475.919, "duration": 18.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "manage there's some folks that go I'm never going to unload this and I'm just going to turn turn turn turn turn turn turn there's impact", "start": 486.72, "duration": 17.018}
{"chunk": "this just keeps spiraling all the way up into finish doesn't feel like you'd have to work so hard and just like block bottom out", "start": 499.08, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "there yes yes because they think that okay the main engines here there's no secondary it'd be like stepping on the gas hard your engine", "start": 506.46, "duration": 17.719}
{"chunk": "just goes and the wheels don't do excuse me okay so it's it's from right here there is a blend of both of these", "start": 515.339, "duration": 19.001}
{"chunk": "at the appropriate time to have Max efficiency okay okay now for most folks most folks not all folks this is the", "start": 524.88, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "main engine that they need to feel okay because everybody's feels are a little bit different but this action right here main engine and that's just a chest rotation yes", "start": 533.88, "duration": 19.8}
{"chunk": "essentially the energy that I actively put in my chest will then leak into the arms through the hands down through the", "start": 543.48, "duration": 15.539}
{"chunk": "shaft and into the club head okay out got it because of this got it not because I'm actively here again most", "start": 551.459, "duration": 18.961}
{"chunk": "some people need this active sure some people do it's not the majority of people got it so you need to identify if that's you or not understood right to to", "start": 560.76, "duration": 18.119999999999997}
{"chunk": "feel really nice nice in the hit Area okay because for some folks there is like an active hit here because they've just trained this so much that they have", "start": 569.88, "duration": 19.62}
{"chunk": "to oh I get to unload the golf club yep but again for most it's because they're trying to actively unload the hands and arm system to get the club unloaded and", "start": 579.54, "duration": 17.698}
{"chunk": "released because in their mind they think that this is where they need to unload the majority of energy got it where it's actually continued all the way up into full finish where would I", "start": 588.899, "duration": 18.382}
{"chunk": "helicopter that of through that window exactly and you need to learn to manage that sure but the Dual fulcrum system is", "start": 597.48, "duration": 19.359}
{"chunk": "this system is the primary okay meaning because the chest is Revan won't go ahead and wrap okay good now see I'm", "start": 607.14, "duration": 15.300999999999998}
{"chunk": "holding this back River see it Go yep so that what's nice is I can load this system by starting the", "start": 614.88, "duration": 20.639}
{"chunk": "engine yeah now I've loaded it more okay now I can hit so that's a scratched fascial line that posterior arm line at", "start": 625.2, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "the lead arm now I can hit here like the more you stretch that band the more that now I can unload but it does need to unload you don't just keep", "start": 633.12, "duration": 15.061}
{"chunk": "stretching that son of a gun sure it's got to unload it it's got to unload at the same time if the club's up there and I'm dropping and I start to turn the", "start": 640.92, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "hand system is also going to be well loaded like see how that's in a big flexion state right there big load here so this whole system is loaded", "start": 649.56, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "but again what actually happens not necessarily what you'll feel but what will actually happen is the engine needs to start to Roar it'll stretch this", "start": 657.72, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "system here there we go now we're loaded so now you'll feel the arm system unload and this will respond whoosh all the way", "start": 666.54, "duration": 16.499}
{"chunk": "out there you go see it just sling yeah now we have a super efficient dual fulcrum system that's precise but Max", "start": 674.459, "duration": 19.88}
{"chunk": "maximum speed yeah efficiency efficiency that's that's what I feel as well exactly so the whole system gets whacked when people in their Mind's Eye I want", "start": 684.019, "duration": 18.941000000000003}
{"chunk": "more speed and the system gets jacked because they think speed comes from somewhere other than this dual fulcrum system got it so let's see one where we", "start": 694.26, "duration": 19.499}
{"chunk": "can do it kind of in slow-mo but what I want to see is this like load phase fully finished to the load phase at P5", "start": 704.04, "duration": 15.001000000000001}
{"chunk": "and then because of this dual fulcrum system again engine all the energy leaks through the arms through the hands through the shaft and into the club head that's where it's going it's", "start": 711.3, "duration": 18.659999999999997}
{"chunk": "transmitting through that all the way up into that P10 there you go so we should just feel like", "start": 720.72, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "see TJ just go and it all gets slung up into that finish let's do that with the uh with the Rope okay just lay it over", "start": 728.22, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "that trail shoulder good now drop engine sling good I feel late that was yeah that's", "start": 736.38, "duration": 19.740000000000002}
{"chunk": "out there again yep and it's over here now let's do the same exact thing with a golf club okay so it's up drop engine sling", "start": 746.1, "duration": 17.28}
{"chunk": "good let's do it with uh in one motion okay but in your mind it's like you're getting this the Rope like slung up here then you're gonna drop there goes the engine in the chest and all the energy", "start": 760.26, "duration": 18.3}
{"chunk": "gets slung out into that P10 there you go and showing just a P10 so you're not folded okay drop engine sling", "start": 769.86, "duration": 19.341}
{"chunk": "there we go what'd that feel like in your mind's eye that it fully unloaded yeah again right through here good where", "start": 779.0, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "did it feel like in your mind that it started to unload actually a lot earlier than that okay right right yeah and", "start": 787.68, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "that's for your system some other guys like will go it never unloads and never unloads okay there it started downloading finished yeah right others are like it starts to unload back in", "start": 795.36, "duration": 17.16}
{"chunk": "here because they feel the arm the hand system start to like get the golf club going everybody's a little bit different with that sure yours is going to be", "start": 803.76, "duration": 15.779}
{"chunk": "individualistic to you and your old map of hit compared to a better map of hit probably for most people who have that", "start": 811.2, "duration": 17.759}
{"chunk": "map of early hit yep it'll feel like the hit comes super late so late yes like they're almost fully up here and then there it goes got it for other guys that", "start": 819.959, "duration": 17.642}
{"chunk": "are like they're just trying to hold on to this sucker which are a few it's probably one out of 20. sure probably see yeah the they need to feel like okay", "start": 829.68, "duration": 16.8}
{"chunk": "I can like whoosh this energy out of the hands yep as they're going here because I already have this nice fulcrum gone the engine's gone yeah the wheels just", "start": 837.42, "duration": 17.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "are stalled so let it out let the wheels go you got to decide which kind of person you are sure and then mess with your system to feel", "start": 845.94, "duration": 18.0}
{"chunk": "really efficient as a player you do that you start to feel real nice as long as you can get into delivery really nicely agree this is the whole system baby that's our model baby let's hit some", "start": 855.12, "duration": 17.701}
