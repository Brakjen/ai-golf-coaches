{"chunk": "how to do is move face stability gotta be able to do that well before you go down but it's just like kind of thrown out", "start": 41.94, "duration": 18.958999999999996}
{"chunk": "like hey you need the opposite issue with your impacts because not really an explanation Beyond just", "start": 65.76, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "that like make sure your impacts will make sure your hips are open super Limited so why don't we start with this go ahead", "start": 73.979, "duration": 18.06}
{"chunk": "and set up to a shot here team impact we're not talking about a specific point in space and then like right here p7 is impact you talk a lot", "start": 84.6, "duration": 22.579}
{"chunk": "about like everything in order so if players can start to see that impact would really be sort of go all", "start": 98.939, "duration": 15.661000000000001}
{"chunk": "the way to like P6 which would be shown level to the ground again somewhere in this general area all the", "start": 107.64, "duration": 15.419}

{"chunk": "often see actually is an extension where the pelvis will come and be the spine goes up and that's what rapidly closes the face because in essence you need to", "start": 218.76, "duration": 19.918000000000003}
{"chunk": "stop rotation to square it so now I can fling it but if you if you're in a good spot like you were go back there again okay and you were to just like trying to", "start": 228.959, "duration": 18.302}
{"chunk": "rotate this down you're going to run into a problem because you run out of room so that's why we see this massive late extension light throw the square of", "start": 238.44, "duration": 17.519}

{"chunk": "the actual credit exactly the very next way on the Range it feels exactly the same place so great so go back there again so we'd", "start": 266.759, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "like to see the the face a little bit down how are you doing that generally speaking how did you organize to there at peace", "start": 276.78, "duration": 19.021}
{"chunk": "when I take this thing so I organize the face early take it up around this top of the backswing finish position right yeah", "start": 285.9, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "what kind of body stuff do I need to go ahead and fall into this organized position yes we'd love to see little drops in the back up there T4 awesome so", "start": 294.06, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "a little drop especially this Trail hips the pelvis just Falls TJ is really good at this in the back string go back to P4", "start": 303.3, "duration": 15.818000000000001}

{"chunk": "got the face kind of toe down you're already up in good bends you've dropped a little bit so if you just simply keep the same amount of Bend and", "start": 340.02, "duration": 17.24}
{"chunk": "turn the chest super simple late like from p six P 5.5 somewhere in there what we", "start": 348.18, "duration": 20.18}
{"chunk": "want students to just generally this is what they're doing is they're using that upper spiral ing about so right up in here from this", "start": 361.02, "duration": 18.538999999999998}
{"chunk": "position it's all exactly yep so and in general you can think of like everybody talks about hip rotation", "start": 370.74, "duration": 15.400999999999998}
{"chunk": "first of all it's a long term analogy because hip rotation is the femur rotating in the socket so it's really", "start": 379.86, "duration": 15.838000000000001}
{"chunk": "pelvic rotation that we're seeing pelvic rotation that's so you can think of like two different systems", "start": 387.479, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "and got ripped down this pelvic system the rib system okay group system is the rotate", "start": 402.0, "duration": 15.48}
{"chunk": "the pelvic system is the drop does it rotate sure passive rotation because of the ribs because it can't just stay", "start": 409.56, "duration": 20.96}
{"chunk": "it's got to fall on the rift exactly there you see that this is the main engine yeah sure", "start": 419.06, "duration": 18.998}
{"chunk": "a bit but it wasn't my first exactly what that just did the pelvic rotation causes early yeah yeah", "start": 428.759, "duration": 17.242}
{"chunk": "a lot of people get this idea that hits yep exactly because the rate of rotation goes up typically for good players", "start": 437.52, "duration": 15.440000000000001}
{"chunk": "there's a lot of Bend like low spine Bend to go ahead and like encounter that so that now I low Point gets whacked out", "start": 453.599, "duration": 17.261}
{"chunk": "block I got to do all kinds of makeup yes manipulations right right you're fits the screw up that you did when you", "start": 465.24, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "heard so yeah rotator ribs dropper helmets so that's can you remind us the", "start": 474.66, "duration": 18.979}
{"chunk": "main thing about this is just so if I'm going rotate see there's a point where okay the ribs", "start": 483.479, "duration": 19.779999999999998}
{"chunk": "are rotating but now if I keep rotating the ribs the pelvis gets drug along so from right here if I just drop", "start": 493.74, "duration": 15.06}
{"chunk": "there's my there's my trail head if I drop the pelvis and then use my ribs to rotate to the other side now the pelvis rotate did I start to", "start": 501.06, "duration": 20.88}
{"chunk": "expand sure but it's late and it's gradual extension trailing it's appropriate extension", "start": 511.379, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "okay so that's really good uh teach because I think just better understanding where rotation comes from look at the front face you", "start": 519.659, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "generally look like all of that stuff is helpful but then we need to find a way to put it into action so drill wise let's walk through what we", "start": 527.64, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "call progression so the way that we do this guys is you go into a generally a nice position and", "start": 535.92, "duration": 15.239999999999998}
{"chunk": "then from here you're going into a mock impact position so this is going to go into account piece of piece and stuff from right there", "start": 543.54, "duration": 16.057000000000002}
{"chunk": "let's drop the pelvis and you're going to use the spiral to rotate the chest of an impact so if you do that again teach just drop", "start": 551.779, "duration": 18.882}
{"chunk": "us and rotate the spiral at the same time or rotate the chest at the same time so it's like you go good so what you'll see TJ's", "start": 561.36, "duration": 15.700999999999999}
{"chunk": "chest is plenty about a 45 degree angle out in front of the golf ball so our more Target side here you'll see this beautiful shape", "start": 570.899, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "he's kind of bent out right here and you'll see that he still has some amount of Trailhead flexion okay so from right there", "start": 580.2, "duration": 16.979}
{"chunk": "how TJ is going to get out of here is really important so in his mind he's coming right back into this generally", "start": 588.72, "duration": 15.02}
{"chunk": "same position through this strike area spiral to rotate him away so let's go ahead and see that beautiful and if you do that again bud", "start": 594.959, "duration": 17.001}
{"chunk": "what's really cool here start rotating the chest so the chest goes and then here come the arms leg keep rotating the chest boom so if we do it improperly go", "start": 606.54, "duration": 17.039}
{"chunk": "back in there again you'll see players just fire These Arms out and the ribs aren't the lead the ribs need to lead so the ribs go go here come", "start": 615.3, "duration": 19.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "from there he'll just drop and start to turn the chest back into the golf ball bang and there's image preset okay so let's go back here again now let's see", "start": 624.72, "duration": 17.639}
{"chunk": "it in one action or one motion right drop turn there's the preset exercise okay there's a couple of things that you", "start": 633.839, "duration": 18.121}
{"chunk": "can do as well um because we we see this quite often where we love rotation through the strike so", "start": 643.26, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "much the players will early rotate typically that throws the golf club and the center of a massive Club over now you got to fix it late yeah if you're a", "start": 650.399, "duration": 19.621}
{"chunk": "good player so what we need this is just general geometry where the club is going back into that preset drop boom so he's right here excellent", "start": 660.0, "duration": 18.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "so now show just a little back swinging right here and then from from there we want the club to go over here so it falls under", "start": 669.42, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "the plank in this transition phase and we're going to do that primarily by bouncing this virus or getting into this Trail again so when it does that there's", "start": 678.12, "duration": 17.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "that big heavy bag to color feel it right here's the player yep exactly and you see how the golf club went under the plane now so now you can rotate back", "start": 687.54, "duration": 19.92}
{"chunk": "into the strike so that's so much better yeah exactly rather than even those like the first", "start": 697.079, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "one that you showed is a little bit fat you're super good player you know where this is supposed to be at the strike so it's easier to early rotate light fix", "start": 705.36, "duration": 17.461000000000002}
{"chunk": "when we bottom activity yep exactly so let's see that again kind of slow-mo so we go into that preset p7", "start": 713.76, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "drop there's the turn on General the club goes up on top of the plan it'll fall under those are beautiful so much covered up", "start": 722.04, "duration": 19.08}
{"chunk": "so now you feel as the athlete that through the strike you're rotating a rotation of the chest", "start": 731.7, "duration": 15.178}
{"chunk": "is what stabilizes the face will rotate it you got to have the club underneath the plan it's got to get back here get back there before here and we rotate", "start": 738.779, "duration": 20.122}
{"chunk": "we're good yeah yeah that's excellent all right so maybe we can talk about some like common things um yeah right yep", "start": 749.1, "duration": 19.861}
{"chunk": "so one that I see a lot is fast for one like like on this Trail foot yeah when you start to try to bounce", "start": 769.68, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "yep okay yep so perfect so two different ways to bend so go ahead and hug them off the rotation so there's two different ways to bend", "start": 777.92, "duration": 19.94}
{"chunk": "one is just generally if I just go this way okay where do you feel a lot of that pressure", "start": 788.66, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "go right back exactly so see where he is he's pointing it out it's in this area here that's all generally speaking else mine right", "start": 798.24, "duration": 18.9}
{"chunk": "right or teaspoon so no good not a healthy action even though your spine did then pretty pretty inefficient way to do things because the other thing about the", "start": 810.48, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "type of band this way the center of mass of the ribs again we're looking for looking for the ribs the lowest ribs on up to the top of his head is a section", "start": 818.639, "duration": 17.879}
{"chunk": "right to pay attention to the center of mass of that area now is all the way back in this Trail so you we prefer to see", "start": 827.279, "duration": 19.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "is what we call Rib sway so in essence TJ is going to keep this shaft relatively level to the ground and if we were to just drive the ribs up there we", "start": 843.42, "duration": 17.999000000000002}
{"chunk": "go see how now the center of mass of the ribs is now up over the top of the Lead Foot yeah pressure is completely different the pressure's completely different and now if you take a look at", "start": 852.959, "duration": 18.42}
{"chunk": "where TJ's sternum is the sternum is forward of where the golf ball was and where the sternum is from a face-on perspective", "start": 861.42, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "where it is in space at the moment of a strike is going to dictate the bottom okay so instead of going preset so go", "start": 870.839, "duration": 16.1}
{"chunk": "ahead and run the preset we want our balance bands instead of bouncing the bands this way okay go back into D7 again preset we're", "start": 878.519, "duration": 17.261}
{"chunk": "going to go away rib sway there we go so now his Center of mass is all the way up Center of mass and the ribs is up over the top or in on", "start": 890.459, "duration": 17.98}
{"chunk": "this InStep of this deep foot so now if you return beautiful way further up there yeah especially for", "start": 898.92, "duration": 15.901}
{"chunk": "good players like you'll feel like okay whatever yeah boom so that rib sway that you're talking", "start": 907.26, "duration": 16.199}
{"chunk": "about is is that then yes so that's Ben wherever so and all of that bin by the way like now just pressure wise where do you feel", "start": 914.399, "duration": 17.262999999999998}
{"chunk": "the pressure when your ribs swing more more so in the upper upper side we're talking this area here so it's", "start": 925.38, "duration": 15.479000000000001}
{"chunk": "kind of like hit here yep yep yep exactly exactly so what's trippy is even though TJ is moving left he's going", "start": 932.579, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "into lightning Trail cycle compared to having to move right to get a car so when people say this", "start": 940.98, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "Trailside band they usually just move this way yep give their bottom not way too far behind exactly because you just saw us goes up here to just balance it", "start": 951.3, "duration": 19.078}
{"chunk": "out yeah it's like a bounce ribs go here the pelvis goes there but at the ribs in here where the pelvis Land There Goes actually", "start": 960.899, "duration": 18.842000000000002}
{"chunk": "yeah so let's hit one still the same like little preset exercise okay you're gonna go away little rips way will help the golf club fall not only underneath", "start": 971.94, "duration": 17.581}
{"chunk": "the plane but it'll also get your center of mass bar enough up balance beautiful amount of energy", "start": 981.12, "duration": 16.298000000000002}
{"chunk": "so that's one one that I see is Lake tug with the arms okay so when you say late tuck with the", "start": 992.16, "duration": 16.4}
{"chunk": "arms so just because pulling on the arms is something that we see out of like an extension tilt pattern right we'll see", "start": 1000.68, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "players rotate the pelvis which creates Trail hip extension tilt with the ribs for good players so now there's that bend that we're talking", "start": 1012.38, "duration": 16.439999999999998}
{"chunk": "about where the bottom up to get up here so I've got to take the arms and just drag the handle far enough up here to control my bottom up", "start": 1020.779, "duration": 19.22}
{"chunk": "to some guy yeah so it's like a leftover left over after Wards as well players will tend to do is the face like if I just take the handle", "start": 1029.059, "duration": 19.822}
{"chunk": "and pull it this direction instead so players will generally move well or they're in this p7 position that's nice", "start": 1044.24, "duration": 17.699}
{"chunk": "work away get into good bins here and now just take this as they turn they'll just pull the handle up get shots that", "start": 1052.94, "duration": 15.18}
{"chunk": "are like either fat or the face stays wide open right it's like this late run of energy in the arms time", "start": 1060.86, "duration": 18.421}
{"chunk": "there's tug so if we get this like late tug like abduct abducted move and all that you're doing is taking the grip", "start": 1070.22, "duration": 15.419}
{"chunk": "and just pulling into the space this direction right and so at the end of the day what we want is the rotation of the chest", "start": 1078.44, "duration": 16.101}
{"chunk": "creates Boom the club the all the energy in the club goes out so players will actually feel the release in their hands much more than", "start": 1085.72, "duration": 16.26}
{"chunk": "their arms preset I'm away into that right band from right here I'm going to unload the golf club", "start": 1094.28, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "on this plane along with rib rotation so you're actively handling this unloading for some players yes for some", "start": 1108.2, "duration": 16.46}
{"chunk": "players it's not what that would do this they're players that do that for sure and like this drill is generally done at a very low rating energy", "start": 1116.78, "duration": 18.799999999999997}
{"chunk": "if I rotate this harder it's tough to keep this energy in here like hold it or maintain this load it'll just have to pass things why it's nice to do things", "start": 1127.82, "duration": 20.099999999999998}
{"chunk": "so I can feel how things match up so in essence what we're saying is that from up here into here the matchup is unload", "start": 1137.9, "duration": 20.299}
{"chunk": "from the hands and Bridge located with the rib engine rotation type so if they take this you know handle", "start": 1147.14, "duration": 17.159}
{"chunk": "pulling tug across the chest out of their pattern yep right now they're actually forced to also work the ribcage because I can't do this anymore", "start": 1160.58, "duration": 19.601}
{"chunk": "and the unload by the way is his favorite my favorite like that is is this kind of heavier", "start": 1172.46, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "flexion Libra selection States so now from here feeling it go out like the energy going out through an extension of", "start": 1180.32, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "the lead wrist so what you'll see is the face is more bone right as I start to unload it the rate of rotation of function", "start": 1188.48, "duration": 16.418}
{"chunk": "we're stuck in this pattern half that's when we want to release it it always looks like that that roll you're talking about though but that patterns that's", "start": 1203.24, "duration": 15.540000000000001}
{"chunk": "not what I'm doing and it's a matchup for some movement it's a matchup for flexion rotators", "start": 1211.52, "duration": 18.58}
{"chunk": "it's not a matchup for an extension tilt pattern the matchup would be drag and then the length supination with this with this", "start": 1222.86, "duration": 17.759999999999998}
{"chunk": "with which supervision is just that heavy heavy rate rotation that's where you get like a high", "start": 1231.5, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "floating right shots with a lot of dark left what is an art investors and they just come at you out of nowhere and that's the frustration", "start": 1239.6, "duration": 15.36}
{"chunk": "that's super frustrating so again just to kind of go through all this we've got like main things to just kind of play around with would be just this drop", "start": 1246.98, "duration": 16.02}
{"chunk": "especially in the trail hip drop and rotate with the ribs to get you into where that preset position generally speaking just understanding", "start": 1254.66, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "where the club is in space as it's moving boom it's up on top the plane under the plane transition and then out as I'm rotating", "start": 1264.02, "duration": 16.258}
{"chunk": "okay and what you were talking about before which is this hinging that I'm rotating the shaft this direction to go ahead and close the", "start": 1272.299, "duration": 16.221}
{"chunk": "face we're feeling like I do that early away boom see where that see where it's at and I don't have to mess with anything so I can just go ribs", "start": 1280.4, "duration": 19.461}
{"chunk": "it's all in one action drop turn up [Music] super simple little shots so now I know", "start": 1289.22, "duration": 15.499}
{"chunk": "what it feels like dynamically to move through this space there's impact P6 or excuse me P5 P6 this whole area all the", "start": 1297.679, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "way the a that's impact now I can feel that even if I'm hitting a full shot I can feel it up oh", "start": 1306.5, "duration": 18.121}
