{"chunk": "one is sacrum second one sternum the third one is sphenoid so you're probably wondering what did we just make that up", "start": 42.92, "duration": 18.281}
{"chunk": "I promise it's a word the sphenoid is basically right between the eyes or in between the eyebrows right where the CR ium is yep right at the brow but what's", "start": 52.76, "duration": 17.64}

{"chunk": "thing that we're going to see with both of those players is the head starts to move that way mhm like you'll see Jack go boom and then start to move this", "start": 71.32, "duration": 17.399}
{"chunk": "trigger shows early upper spiral movement yeah because the spiral if you go a posterior", "start": 79.84, "duration": 16.601}
{"chunk": "view starts right here mhm so if we're looking at this side it's going down the neck over over this scap under the", "start": 87.28, "duration": 16.28}
{"chunk": "armpit and then goes diagonal across Alex's abdomen and then keeps going down so but it starts up here so if we're looking in the back swing what we're", "start": 95.96, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "going to be doing is stretching out that entire fascia line and we like to see it from from top down so to load this there", "start": 105.56, "duration": 17.520000000000003}

{"chunk": "eye sockets are actually moving Target side compared to some of the other movers that we wouldn't prefer to see they're moving that way yeah and we'd", "start": 131.879, "duration": 16.241}

{"chunk": "here like if you look at Lee at impact yes where is eye sockets yes I think just in playing with this let's hit a couple of shots here yeah go ahead and", "start": 166.36, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "set up for us and let's just play with the very upper spiral to mess with the t-spine and what your what Your Skull is", "start": 174.959, "duration": 18.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "going to be doing so the start your trigger we're going to go here to trigger and then I want you to feel like", "start": 184.36, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "feel how that loads this like I'm not just turning you this way yeah I'm turning you that way so your eyes are actually staying on the same level or", "start": 193.159, "duration": 17.599000000000004}
{"chunk": "plane of the target line so I'm not rotating you here see the axis of the eyes goes yes it's there so that loads this upper spiral now if you just kept", "start": 201.879, "duration": 18.320999999999998}
{"chunk": "spiraling to the top boom now let's go ahead and drop start to do good stuff and now here goes the head look at where your eyes are there still on the same", "start": 210.72, "duration": 16.360999999999997}
{"chunk": "axis but see how your skull is pointing here the eye sockets are there correct okay so let's just hit a couple of pitchy shots yeah playing with what's", "start": 219.4, "duration": 16.839}
{"chunk": "going on up there that's the start right there that's the start it's there there good show me just into back swing there", "start": 227.239, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "we go there was the like you saw that little trigger yep now pelvis is going to drop and as you start to work into the other bin see the difference in like what where your head is moving there", "start": 237.0, "duration": 18.239}
{"chunk": "yeah okay so let's go ahead and just hit one and I'm going to play with you here go ahead and set up so wait for my trigger and then we're going to go little shots there there feel where I'm", "start": 245.959, "duration": 20.558999999999997}
{"chunk": "where I'm moving you yeah looking at where the sphenoid is we're going to see more like where that if there was a pin pointing out of your like dome right", "start": 256.239, "duration": 20.962}
{"chunk": "where would that be pointing in space and how are you moving moving your head that trickle down and that look in the c-spine will trickle down into your", "start": 266.44, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "t-spine will help scat movement appropriate bends without you even having to worry about it MH and the only thing you need to", "start": 274.36, "duration": 15.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "manage is pelvic drop in the transition phase it's really the only thing right let's hit another couple shots like that okay show where your head's going to", "start": 281.8, "duration": 20.12}
{"chunk": "go even more that way okay feel it Go W okay okay that way there we go mhm that", "start": 291.36, "duration": 20.32}
{"chunk": "yes good so we're up to the top good start to drop feel that yeah so the bend actually", "start": 301.12, "duration": 17.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "is more like in here and it leaks down into the upper spine so this is really where we're just seeing all the band is in there yes this is", "start": 310.72, "duration": 17.32}
{"chunk": "relatively like neutral out straight up and down it's not moving much right okay so let's just manage your Dome and", "start": 319.52, "duration": 15.679}
{"chunk": "manage the pelvis good there there there beautiful yeah uh gosh I don't know", "start": 326.639, "duration": 16.04}
{"chunk": "where I heard it but someone made the comment that Gary Player described it that he felt like he was hitting up on the ball and I bet you it had to feel", "start": 335.919, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "more of like this sensation then say uhhuh or whatever weird yeah that's the same it looks like you're swinging up", "start": 343.6, "duration": 18.48}
{"chunk": "yeah it's cuz your eyes are on this yep and the curve should feel this way with like the C and T spine but the pelvis is", "start": 353.319, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "dropping and moving this way so it balances the system so if I did this but I'm extending this would be no good yeah", "start": 361.639, "duration": 15.200000000000001}
{"chunk": "then you're just here yeah way out exactly exactly like that just does not balance out for for proper impact like management you're just going to suck", "start": 369.52, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "right you're not going to hit good shots that way right but this is fun because again like and this is a brachi ISM Luke", "start": 378.759, "duration": 17.482}
{"chunk": "brachy always talks about how a specific joint movement an active joint movement moves neighboring joints well", "start": 386.44, "duration": 16.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "if I'm focused up in here that'd be probably a pretty good place for most people to think about side Bend because anytime somebody goes side Bend they go", "start": 395.12, "duration": 16.72}
{"chunk": "bam immediately makes them extend which they hate but they hear that side Bend is good so the picture that they have in their mind just stinks this is side Bend", "start": 402.96, "duration": 21.88}
{"chunk": "yeah well then even like how you said it leaks down when you go just side Bend with with the upper uh to me it feels", "start": 413.84, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "like the ribs got shoved yes's rib s that we talk about so rather than cuz some someone might go oh rib Sway and then their head might do something funny", "start": 421.72, "duration": 20.041}
{"chunk": "or just this thought uh doesn't quite fit but if you go oh I felt that same little like I feel like someone's going", "start": 431.84, "duration": 15.44}
{"chunk": "and pushing the rib out but I'm just thinking exactly and so this rib sway becomes a response to what you're doing", "start": 440.24, "duration": 17.56}
{"chunk": "in your skull and cine so what's so fun with those three areas is which one works for the player cuz we", "start": 448.4, "duration": 17.239}
{"chunk": "talk about you've talked a bunch about for some people you know feel the sacrum Fish Hook and that spits spits", "start": 457.84, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "the golf club out yeah yep other people it's rib sway you know out towards your lead foot yep to then get you to Arc it", "start": 465.68, "duration": 15.641000000000002}
{"chunk": "around now we kind of have this third one of if those kind of aren't quite right for you go what if I just side Bend and you're like oh what I just got", "start": 473.72, "duration": 19.278}
{"chunk": "yes the rib sway so people have these little intricacies within the system that all still get you to the same spot", "start": 483.039, "duration": 15.481}
{"chunk": "and the toughest thing I think is is if we're talking about systems we're we're speaking in terms of there there needs to be bookins for systems yeah right and", "start": 490.639, "duration": 18.6}
{"chunk": "the the tough part is is sometimes people need a lot of something and sometimes they need just a dash this is", "start": 500.12, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "a dash and so for really good movers already just playing with like okay how does this lead like movement in the golf", "start": 507.56, "duration": 16.521}
{"chunk": "swing and I'm just managing drop so I would be going skull drop skull skull drop skull the whole time and that Skull", "start": 515.76, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "action like where it's moving it's moving because your spine is moving it's moving because the C- spine is actively moving your skull there yeah but the", "start": 525.08, "duration": 16.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "thought is just where my eyes yeah you want to like you can your can your eyes make a figure eight in space it's like this exactly so it's like it's like the", "start": 533.0, "duration": 15.0}
{"chunk": "little version of our swim move now your eyes are going yeah but it's up in here it's up in your Dome son okay so let's see one more here Alex but I want it to", "start": 540.92, "duration": 17.359}
{"chunk": "be slow enough it's not clunky but I want it to be slow enough that we can actively see eyes pelvis eyes like that", "start": 548.64, "duration": 18.000999999999998}
{"chunk": "sequence of movement we can see eyes pelvis eyes there we go pitchy full swing pitchy eyes pelvis eyes", "start": 558.16, "duration": 19.84}
{"chunk": "beautiful yeah that feels like it's such a late hit as far as eyes are way out in front and there", "start": 567.8, "duration": 17.72}
{"chunk": "you go the arm there goes the hit yeah it's not here from here so again like we we we came up with this idea of like the", "start": 576.8, "duration": 15.038999999999998}
{"chunk": "3 s's yesterday just because it like okay well that's easy to remember yeah s s * three right um but again sphenoid is", "start": 584.519, "duration": 17.52}
{"chunk": "just like okay we're we're taking this point in space but just managing how we're moving it because of skull movement right right yeah where's the", "start": 593.399, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "cranium going then we've got uh sternum and that point in space and really what we're talking about there rib management and we're talking about sacrum we're", "start": 600.04, "duration": 17.6}
{"chunk": "talking about pelvic management but it's cool to throw the the skull into this because now we get to open the door to like c-spine movement that c-spine", "start": 609.88, "duration": 15.719999999999999}
{"chunk": "trickles down into T which is a great way to look at Bend rather than l-spine bend and we can really start to feel like okay the bends and the movements up", "start": 617.64, "duration": 17.479999999999997}
{"chunk": "here with skull and like this whole this whole rure and then there's the drop which is just in the pelvis yeah and I think it's really important too", "start": 626.24, "duration": 19.64}
{"chunk": "like what our job is as coaches is to help players have better pictures of Motoring the golf club moving well so", "start": 635.48, "duration": 15.878999999999998}
{"chunk": "that they can get in and out of like space well and it's up to the player then to be able to manage the hit so", "start": 643.88, "duration": 15.04}
{"chunk": "what should happen is like okay I'm working on these like large changes in Gross movement pattern okay that's great", "start": 651.959, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "and you just assess did I do it or not did I make my head move in this way now you can hit one poorly that's okay then", "start": 659.959, "duration": 16.081}
{"chunk": "modify the hit right like if the if you hit one 3 in fat move your darn divot forward it's simple you move the same", "start": 667.8, "duration": 15.401}
{"chunk": "way move the same way but just manage the hit move the divot around I keep hitting it on the heel all right well hit one on the darn toe like figure out", "start": 675.68, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "the hit yeah our job is to make it easier once you arrive at at like the delivery position so that this is easier on you but it's", "start": 683.92, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "still no guarantee that you're going to flush it the athlete has to figure that area out correct but the whole point there is like if you're balanced through", "start": 692.04, "duration": 20.999}
{"chunk": "the 3 s's those are real like big motor engine pattern like hurdles that players need to be able to manage but when they do it it just simply makes the hit", "start": 701.56, "duration": 20.361}
{"chunk": "easier yeah then athlete manage the hit manage the hit yes figure out these three S's let your body move without", "start": 711.56, "duration": 17.959}
{"chunk": "strain or as minimal strain as possible so that can be someone's feedback when trying to incorporate if they want to focus upstairs a little bit more is okay", "start": 721.399, "duration": 18.32}
{"chunk": "with that little idea of the figure8 eyes mhm does it feel better on the body versus what you did before forget golf", "start": 730.519, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "ball but just the motion I'm trying to make here Y is that feeling better on the body than prior yep and that's where", "start": 739.079, "duration": 15.281}
{"chunk": "the golfer or the athlete gets to decide yes or know and then modify as someone sees fit exactly so manage your s's keep", "start": 747.04, "duration": 18.719}
{"chunk": "them in check keep them in check it'll help balance out your entire system it it'll make it a heck of a lot easier for you to just manage the hit and hit better golf shots yes sir Alex you're", "start": 756.079, "duration": 18.520000000000003}
