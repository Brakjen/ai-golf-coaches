{"chunk": "lifeline okay okay so what's nice what you just described if if I go this way okay because that's generally speaking", "start": 432.479, "duration": 16.198999999999998}
{"chunk": "neutral standing posture can I just lift my arms up and put that right hand or Trail hand okay if you're a left-handed golfer it'd", "start": 440.819, "duration": 16.44}
{"chunk": "be the other way but for us righties that Lifeline just sits right where that that thumb would be sitting so it runs", "start": 449.819, "duration": 15.242}
{"chunk": "like directly up that Lifeline just goes right in there right through there so it just sit right in there so when this this hand wraps around the more that it", "start": 456.96, "duration": 15.178999999999998}
{"chunk": "wraps around what you're doing is squeezing the like meaty thumb pad and the meaty pinky pad together and you create that Valley like you described", "start": 464.819, "duration": 17.22}
{"chunk": "okay and that's right where the thumb would sit it's almost like a little puzzle piece that sits in there yes that's what it feels like is it they just fit together nicely when you make that that shape there okay exactly and", "start": 473.759, "duration": 19.200000000000003}
{"chunk": "the reason that that fits nicely for you is you have a very neutral grip okay folks that have a neutral", "start": 482.699, "duration": 15.120000000000001}
{"chunk": "left hand or lead hand yep and a stronger Trail hand they don't have that opportunity to have that sit in there so it's like where does this kind of sit right it just doesn't sit in there so", "start": 490.139, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "you'll see that often we see both thumbs my favorite grips you don't see that and you tell me if this is like myth or real", "start": 499.379, "duration": 15.001000000000001}

{"chunk": "always nice to have like a little puzzle piece that just fits in there nicely I think you probably feel really comfortable with that because you've gripped it so many times it's like", "start": 516.12, "duration": 17.219}
{"chunk": "that's good yeah right but you train the heck out of that to have a quality grip yep okay the other really important", "start": 523.919, "duration": 15.42}
{"chunk": "thing about grip is the reason that we the reason that we need more of a neutral grip within the system and again there's wiggle room there's playroom", "start": 531.6, "duration": 17.721}
{"chunk": "for obvious different reasons I mean you see like Fleetwood has a little bit more of a cup up at the top of his swing right where more Cowa John ROM DJ", "start": 540.86, "duration": 15.879999999999999}
{"chunk": "they've got more of a flex lead wrist okay generally speaking you're going to have a weaker lead hand so when you Flex the lead rest of the top that generally", "start": 549.0, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "you'll see if they're gripping it that hand is a little bit weaker exactly yes exactly exactly generally speaking not always but generally okay and guys that", "start": 557.88, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "have a little bit more extension at the top of their swing so like Fleetwood for instance Fleetwood yep would have a stronger lead hand exactly stronger", "start": 567.36, "duration": 18.36}
{"chunk": "exactly and then Adam Scott has a little bit of a stronger lead hand however at the same time why is that why why is there the difference in how they grip it", "start": 575.82, "duration": 17.159999999999997}
{"chunk": "and like what is what is occurring there you know I think sometimes what happens is good athletes like as you progress", "start": 584.76, "duration": 15.3}
{"chunk": "through the game and you become more and more Advanced everybody has little quirks that they just latch onto and so you just naturally start without even", "start": 592.44, "duration": 18.48}

{"chunk": "enough golf balls you're going to figure some stuff out for sure it's interesting because I was watching a video I think it was a Tailor-Made video with DJ and", "start": 610.019, "duration": 17.342}
{"chunk": "more cow and they had him in this video together because they both bow and murakala is looking at DJ and he's like I think people think that we were taught", "start": 618.6, "duration": 18.720000000000002}
{"chunk": "that nobody ever told me to do that and if somebody told me to bow my left hand I don't even know if I could right but it's something he just does yeah he just", "start": 627.54, "duration": 18.06}
{"chunk": "does it's just a quirk okay which again is is awesome quirks are great everybody needs them because you feel things better that way", "start": 636.66, "duration": 16.08}
{"chunk": "you just know your own golf swing that's my theory on like that little match up but again in general like looking at Adam Scott", "start": 644.7, "duration": 18.358}
{"chunk": "dual internal more so like you look at his setup yep especially especially down in the hand system more dual pronated", "start": 653.399, "duration": 16.622}
{"chunk": "yeah so he's got a stronger lead hand but he's got a really nice weaker Trail hand so that's kind of a pairing that you would see with an Adam Scott right", "start": 662.04, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "see that beautiful shape there's extension and that's one of our favorite pairings right is is Morse more or less right a stronger lead and a weaker Trail", "start": 670.56, "duration": 19.02}
{"chunk": "exactly and for the most part for general population that's a good one because now what they'll they'll tend to do to like Leverage The Golf Club is", "start": 679.32, "duration": 19.379}
{"chunk": "just Rd it all day if you like you talk about Rd like that's kind of the natural way they'll leverage the golf club from this strong lead week Trail and if you", "start": 689.339, "duration": 15.421}
{"chunk": "like go back and watch one of our previous videos on face stability Rd is one of the main ways that you create that stability right exactly and it's a", "start": 697.62, "duration": 15.899999999999999}
{"chunk": "really easy way to get energy out of the system yeah it's like a hammer right yep exactly exactly and that pairs really well with some extension okay so like to", "start": 705.36, "duration": 15.659000000000002}
{"chunk": "hit a little further that's a good way to to match that up sure okay this is a really important Point too in that okay we've got our hands on the grip but then", "start": 713.16, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "how the center of mass of the club is interacting with that is super important so the center of mass of the club is just a balance point okay so you", "start": 722.399, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "just hold your Club out like that and just balance it out generally speaking right got it perfect that's the center of mass okay okay from a face on perspective the", "start": 730.68, "duration": 18.96}
{"chunk": "center of mass and it's easier sometimes to just look at like the shaft angle sure the shaft should still be pointed from a face on", "start": 740.04, "duration": 19.799}
{"chunk": "perspective inside the lead elbow okay so in here somewhere yep somewhere in there to the to the center of mass of my body", "start": 748.86, "duration": 21.541}
{"chunk": "so the the general area to set this golf club up so like if I set up right here see how this the center of mass of the club is pointing right up towards my", "start": 759.24, "duration": 17.579}
{"chunk": "navel sure that would be fine okay or I could have it underneath that lead arm just a little bit more so now this the", "start": 768.42, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "the shaft of the golf club is running up this lead arm okay and the reason being we're setting that system up in a good spot to be able", "start": 776.94, "duration": 18.66}
{"chunk": "to now deliver the golf club and hit the golf ball and if you look at every really Elite ball striker in general", "start": 785.82, "duration": 17.819}
{"chunk": "the center of mass shaft and and the lead elbow all line up at impact so that", "start": 794.519, "duration": 15.600999999999999}
{"chunk": "look there exactly exactly so this sheet plane whatever you want to call it balance is balanced out accordingly so", "start": 802.38, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "you definitely won't see guys this way yeah that's an imbalance yep okay and you hardly ever see that because you're just dragging on the club and just generally speaking it doesn't feel like", "start": 811.44, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "you have anything in that sure okay and you won't see high level players that way where the the center of mass and", "start": 818.94, "duration": 16.56}
{"chunk": "shaft run underneath the trail so you so in general right you can think of like a little box here you got Center of mass of your body and and just inside your", "start": 826.74, "duration": 16.499000000000002}
{"chunk": "lead arm as long as the butt end of the club is pointing somewhere in this region yeah you're good that's pretty good and the reason being is because that impact", "start": 835.92, "duration": 15.479}
{"chunk": "we try to create kind of those same conditions right generally speaking Yeah the arm system is is especially the lead", "start": 844.019, "duration": 15.722000000000001}
{"chunk": "arm and shaft okay that system should again generally speaking be replaced yeah okay and that's a good way to think of like", "start": 851.04, "duration": 18.598}
{"chunk": "the the lead Arms job in swinging the golf club it's sole responsibility or main responsibility is precision okay", "start": 860.519, "duration": 17.342}
{"chunk": "because I start with the shaft and the lead arm on one plane sure the Leading Edge would be on that plane as well yep see how the Leading Edge is it looks", "start": 869.1, "duration": 19.379}
{"chunk": "like a couple of degrees open yeah it's not because it's working down this particular plane here if I was to go", "start": 878.82, "duration": 17.821}

{"chunk": "still creating that same line that you're talking about right this little system it's Square to the point got it exactly exactly so that's an important one to look at but again from a swing", "start": 895.98, "duration": 20.158}
{"chunk": "perspective if I'm swinging this up okay and then I'm swinging it back down which is how the arm system works in the golf swing that's its job now again that", "start": 905.339, "duration": 15.782}
{"chunk": "doesn't look anything like golf swing no okay so go ahead and set up here just with the lead arm okay just swing it up no body rotation good now if you just", "start": 913.98, "duration": 16.379}
{"chunk": "turn the body and keep that system the same that all of a sudden looks like a golf swing yep replacing of it boom we want that whole system to be", "start": 922.019, "duration": 20.461}
{"chunk": "retained right so so here's setup we're going to do that same exercise yep pick it up turn and then when I replace I", "start": 931.5, "duration": 15.658999999999999}
{"chunk": "want to relatively yep maintain that system we kind of Set It address exactly exactly the right arm's job is to create", "start": 939.779, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "some leverage okay okay so if you look down the line teach if you go ahead and set up for us okay swing it back to the top and then replace it back to where", "start": 948.18, "duration": 15.838999999999999}
{"chunk": "impact would be boom you'll notice what TJ does really well here is the center of mass of the club through the hands through this", "start": 956.639, "duration": 16.621000000000002}
{"chunk": "Trail elbow is now all on one plane as well oh so if you're going to put pressure against my hands here", "start": 964.38, "duration": 15.301000000000002}

{"chunk": "leverage onto the golf club got it and so that's that's what creates the feeling at impact especially for high level players they'll feel this what", "start": 981.12, "duration": 16.68}
{"chunk": "this whole system is doing is like how much pressure I'm going to put into it okay especially for like little chips you can feel it in most folks feel it in", "start": 989.82, "duration": 16.619999999999997}
{"chunk": "their Trail hand they'll talk about the hand being like what feels like they put the pressure on it compared to the lead lead hand and lead arm they'll feel it", "start": 998.04, "duration": 15.658999999999999}
{"chunk": "in here okay why interesting is is it feels like okay well here's the leverage point that I can put leverage onto the golf ball", "start": 1006.62, "duration": 18.12}
{"chunk": "either a lot and shoot the energy out of the system yep or I can just turn and kind of chip it there right or put a", "start": 1014.36, "duration": 15.66}
{"chunk": "little bit of Leverage into it you can just play with shop making about how far you know so here's like a lot of Leverage right and then you could turn", "start": 1023.18, "duration": 17.580000000000002}
{"chunk": "with that system and and at a very low rate of energy and you would just be relatively maintaining that leverage through the strike exactly right and", "start": 1031.459, "duration": 15.6}
{"chunk": "then if you turn the system with a bunch of energy you just let that lever go essentially right exactly and like that with the shallowing move too if we go", "start": 1039.799, "duration": 15.841}
{"chunk": "back to this some of the challenge we talk a lot about the the ribs but in that transition period this lead arm going internal pairs with the ribs but", "start": 1047.36, "duration": 18.839999999999996}
{"chunk": "notice how like think of this as like Orion's belt the elbow my hands and the center of mass okay okay so Orion's", "start": 1056.72, "duration": 16.799}
{"chunk": "belt's all in line there yeah now I got it out of line imbalance see how this I just broke the star system so why did you break the star system what'd you do", "start": 1065.059, "duration": 15.961}
{"chunk": "all in the wrist structure okay see how the elbow's not doing anything so that's a really common one I see people try to do when they're trying to shallow is they just go boom yep and now the", "start": 1073.34, "duration": 17.82}
{"chunk": "Orion's Belt is broken as you just talked about right exactly okay exactly so if we're back up to the top I can replace the system", "start": 1082.34, "duration": 19.339}
{"chunk": "because Orion's Belt stays in in harmony so now I have these three points yeah still in line just like they were here", "start": 1091.059, "duration": 16.54}
{"chunk": "yep okay well most of that's done in the ribs like if I just do it in the ribs how that leaks to some internal rotation the lead arm there you go and that will", "start": 1099.799, "duration": 17.881}
{"chunk": "also help the trail elbow lower yep so now as I turn we'll see that shape so now I have this leverage point of again", "start": 1108.08, "duration": 17.52}
