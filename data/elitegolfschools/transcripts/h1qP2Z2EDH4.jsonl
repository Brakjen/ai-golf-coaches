{"chunk": "place the club on the target side of the ball so you just lift it up over the top okay the two parts are the unload of the club so what we mean by that is this is", "start": 23.599, "duration": 17.962}
{"chunk": "roughly the center mass of the club you could also just focus on the club head in essence this area of the club you're first going to send it towards the", "start": 32.68, "duration": 16.159}
{"chunk": "Target and then respond with the chest turning so that your chest is going to point all the way up into this like corner of the room here so it's kind of", "start": 39.96, "duration": 16.92}
{"chunk": "up in a full there you go so you'll notice that your body in general is fully unloaded and the club is just", "start": 49.079, "duration": 16.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "spearing straight out of your sternum from there just general pictures here if you just took the club the whole thing and folded it up over your left shoulder", "start": 57.12, "duration": 15.759999999999998}

{"chunk": "what the best players in the world do they will toss the club in this same window in space here each and every time", "start": 72.52, "duration": 15.561}
{"chunk": "it's not like they dump one here and then the next one's over there and then they roll it over and the next one's blocked it's like all different in here it's always there you're always like", "start": 80.64, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "unloading the instrument in the same window in space got it okay now again we want that to be dynamic so how I'm", "start": 88.92, "duration": 16.119}
{"chunk": "explaining that is one two and it's like yeah for sure okay so we don't want that so let's see one again we're always going to set up nicely the ball always", "start": 96.88, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "then place the club in front now let's see this just buffed off one two good now see where you're at in space mhm front loader is just swing it", "start": 105.799, "duration": 20.319}
{"chunk": "away and back to that same point in space All In one motion now the question is did you land in the same space or was", "start": 116.039, "duration": 21.561}
{"chunk": "it different say it was close but it wasn't exactly on it so let's do it again I want to see my ey test is more of a sequential one", "start": 127.0, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "two that's the best one now go right back to the same point in space now when you do that yeah that one actually exited in", "start": 136.12, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "the window yes absolutely so that first one is called we'll just call that front loaders just for like our terms based on like comments and if you have questions", "start": 145.68, "duration": 16.801}
{"chunk": "on that particular drill front loader front loader got it okay so we start there so we understand where the unload phase is the next one and I don't even", "start": 154.44, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "know what to call this we need better words sure um we could call it our we'll call it the Walk It Out Walk It Out walk", "start": 162.8, "duration": 16.361}
{"chunk": "it out let's see Walk It Out okay we're going to have the feet together for this drill okay the order of events in stepping is right foot left fo but we", "start": 171.36, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "need to know like generally the the space of this right so it's not these like huge steps here cuz if I go step step all of a sudden I look like a dork", "start": 180.28, "duration": 18.559}
{"chunk": "yeah okay so it's a small step small step we set up to the golf ball normal feet together hover the club to start", "start": 188.599, "duration": 18.04}
{"chunk": "okay once we're here at the same time the club head is going to travel towards the target when my trail foot makes a", "start": 197.68, "duration": 15.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "small step away one okay okay the next phase and I'll just have you do this so I don't just hit you right in the freaking face okay", "start": 206.08, "duration": 15.28}
{"chunk": "you're going to send the club back based on chest rotation and you can send it with your arms and hands as well away from the target while at the same time", "start": 213.879, "duration": 15.799999999999999}
{"chunk": "you step with the Lead Foot towards the target there you go good so there is the load phase one", "start": 222.08, "duration": 18.28}
{"chunk": "two good now stay right there where's front loader beautiful so let's set up to a golf ball you'll set up to it normally like you're", "start": 230.72, "duration": 17.64}
{"chunk": "getting ready to hit a shot on course okay okay from there bring the feet together okay and hover the club right", "start": 239.959, "duration": 18.521}
{"chunk": "above so now show the one two and freeze front loader beautiful this what we can do is", "start": 247.76, "duration": 18.959}
{"chunk": "like the seasonings the center mass of the club head in the load phase we would like to see that ride slightly on top of", "start": 258.479, "duration": 17.201}
{"chunk": "the plane and then in the transitionary phase just fall under slightly so on top under see where that Golf Club went and you can keep the", "start": 267.04, "duration": 18.24}
{"chunk": "hands up there it's just this little bit of like Drop there where it just kind of Falls there you go now from there where's front loader beautiful okay so", "start": 276.12, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "let's set up to it again so it's the exact same picture in your mind te mhm all we're doing is just managing the center mass of the club head during this", "start": 285.84, "duration": 17.121}
{"chunk": "load phase while doing all the steps and all the cool stuff all the foundational stuff too good now that was cool that", "start": 294.0, "duration": 20.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "you skipped ahead I did okay which is fine and we see this all the time what's awesome is like notice how clear in your", "start": 304.4, "duration": 15.041}

{"chunk": "stop up here sure but in your mind you're like I know where the center of mass is I know where my laterals are going I know where this is like it's all one that felt amazing that felt so good", "start": 330.28, "duration": 19.519000000000002}
{"chunk": "right so now it's just like understand the map that created it now you can work on the map right that's exactly right one two good and the club's perfect Now", "start": 340.199, "duration": 17.162}
{"chunk": "where's front loader beautiful now what's interesting is that one the freaking strike wasn't good no it wasn't that no not good at all so", "start": 348.44, "duration": 18.479000000000003}
{"chunk": "it's harder it like it doesn't feel nearly as athletic as the previous one because it's all bouncy yes that's when it feels really good that's when it", "start": 357.84, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "feels really good the purpose of the two-piece is so that you can go one hundo on how am I moving here did I do", "start": 365.479, "duration": 16.96}
{"chunk": "that or not if I didn't do it then let's do it again so we're not necessarily concerned with the strike as much when you're doing an exercise like this not at all we we earn the strike it comes", "start": 374.039, "duration": 20.44}
{"chunk": "later okay these are ways to either maintain or learn a proper just Dynamic motion so that you're swing again like the purpose of a drill is to make you", "start": 383.4, "duration": 18.039}
{"chunk": "feel better right let's go ahead and just do kind of a 60% or just one motion sure where you have like a great picture it's the same exercise same drill that", "start": 393.319, "duration": 18.842}
{"chunk": "you were doing got it okay but I'm still what's the load what's the unload there you go and again that one", "start": 401.96, "duration": 15.718999999999998}
{"chunk": "all a sudden it feels really good because you just keep on swimming throughout the whole swing yep so that's drill two two yeah BL it out freezer", "start": 410.479, "duration": 20.241}
{"chunk": "whatever you want to call it right okay I don't even know what to call this next one we'll call it send it we'll call it", "start": 420.44, "duration": 15.719000000000001}
{"chunk": "send send it drill what we're looking to do at at certain times in the go swing is the club head or the Cento Mass", "start": 428.12, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "should be working in opposition of the pressure of my body oh okay say that again sorry okay you bet so this is", "start": 436.479, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "this is a lot to grasp right right the center of mass of the club or the club heads so I'm talking about this general area should be working in opposition of", "start": 444.599, "duration": 19.881999999999998}
{"chunk": "the pressure in which my body is traveling and the pressure that I'm talking about right now is this lateral pressure got it the best swingers of the", "start": 454.28, "duration": 16.079}
{"chunk": "club will see the center of mass of the club or the club head continue to elevate and continue to finish in this like away swing and the directionality", "start": 462.52, "duration": 19.361}
{"chunk": "of the Pressure Works in opposition of that see how this is going up and back and I'm working back forward again so what we want like that's the purpose of", "start": 472.12, "duration": 16.158}
{"chunk": "this drill is like see where my pressure works this way and the center mass of the club went that way and then I go turn and as it arrives up there then", "start": 480.039, "duration": 17.08}
{"chunk": "you're going the opposite way that's the purpose of That Walk It Out drill gotcha okay so what this is is we're going to set up to the golf ball normal stance", "start": 489.159, "duration": 17.681}
{"chunk": "now so we're not here normal stance you'll hover the club and this is in sequence one two I'm going to send the", "start": 497.479, "duration": 17.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "club head towards the target once I feel that go I'm going to move my ribs and my chest away and continue to turn Okay one two", "start": 505.879, "duration": 19.4}

{"chunk": "can go oh I'll just send it and now you don't even realize that you're sending the golf club back with arm action rather than the body so we want this one", "start": 524.68, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "see that look yep one huh if I wanted to complete the load phas one here there's the step back doesn't that look very similar to this exercise it do right", "start": 531.76, "duration": 19.840000000000003}
{"chunk": "where I'm going step there absolutely so in in essence we're here send it complete front loader that's the map yep", "start": 541.6, "duration": 18.439}
{"chunk": "okay so so kind of the step drill without stepping that's exactly right so we're getting really close to a normal Golf Point here yep so now as you're watching this you can see where this is", "start": 551.519, "duration": 19.6}
{"chunk": "going first this is responding beautiful okay now we're going to hit one we've got the Fe and all the way from there we're never", "start": 560.36, "duration": 16.238999999999997}

{"chunk": "like think about it almost as like dribbling a dribbling a ball so if I'm dribbling like this is I'm I'm catching", "start": 581.6, "duration": 17.199}
{"chunk": "bouncy bouncy it's not here you're going with it exactly exactly there's a rhythm to it there it is see all the time good", "start": 589.32, "duration": 21.041}

{"chunk": "Avenues now to understand like where where am I dumping out where am I feeling like energy how am I starting all that stuff becomes sensory it's", "start": 645.519, "duration": 18.041}
{"chunk": "difficult to describe for sure let's hit a shot now through the sense of is that you just gave yourself now you're aware", "start": 654.32, "duration": 15.36}

{"chunk": "boom excellent in essence we start with front loader yep which gives players a better understanding of where they dumping energy out in the unload phase", "start": 682.519, "duration": 17.162}
{"chunk": "and how to do so then we went to walk it out which is just simply understanding lateral pressures rotational pressures", "start": 691.48, "duration": 16.919999999999998}
{"chunk": "and just how the club fits in with that sequentially mhm and then we went to what we want to call it what do we call", "start": 700.0, "duration": 15.918}
{"chunk": "it wave no I think we said uh it yeah it's a send it drill send it drill so all that is is feeling the sequence of", "start": 707.399, "duration": 15.361}
{"chunk": "Club then the center of mass of the ribs being able to bounce the club back so you start to get this like understanding of the oppositions that we're talking", "start": 715.519, "duration": 19.28}
{"chunk": "about when when talking about the club or the center mass of the club and how the rib rib unit rib system is moving so", "start": 725.399, "duration": 16.561}
