{"chunk": "too good but like Scotty's a hell of a ball Striker will that was his calling card before his injury so now it's just who can putt better and I think it could", "start": 745.36, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "you could see them two ding it out on a consistent basis because you know ball strikings would get you in the door it's just putting that close to the deal yeah", "start": 754.639, "duration": 16.761}

{"chunk": "he's the master Wizard and we're talking about flying wedges yeah um when we look at wedges typically from an average", "start": 1598.52, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "golfer Junior golfer people launch it way too high yes right and it's just the inconsistencies that you have with wedges come from that launch angle so we", "start": 1606.12, "duration": 15.760000000000002}
{"chunk": "need to be able to efficiently get the golf ball to launch a little bit lower so that when it goes into the green it spins consistently the way it reacts on", "start": 1614.32, "duration": 16.878}
{"chunk": "the greens is consistent and you can actually hit the distances that you're trying to hit it right pretty much every time you swing the club so instead of swinging a wedge and it landing and", "start": 1622.679, "duration": 18.160999999999998}
{"chunk": "releasing and then the next time it lands and it spins back now you know it's going to land do the exact same thing and when it launches at a lower", "start": 1631.679, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "trajectory you're going to be able to control that distance a little easier so we're going after more predictability here pretty much right when you pull a wedge out of your bag it's not I hope I", "start": 1639.6, "duration": 18.159}
{"chunk": "hit the distance correctly it's I know if I make this swing with this club at this launch angle it's going to go that distance so now when you get inside", "start": 1648.159, "duration": 16.681}
{"chunk": "those scoring zones like inside of 100 yards I can hit the green more consistently I can maybe even go after some pins a little more confidently hit", "start": 1656.72, "duration": 16.319000000000003}
{"chunk": "it a little closer and ultimately should lower the scores yeah these are scoring wedges so we need to be able to score with them right okay so walk me through how we need to flight these bad boys", "start": 1664.679, "duration": 19.32}
{"chunk": "okay so first of all just swing one tr's gonna swing one here at Absolute full speed so at full speed send it", "start": 1673.519, "duration": 21.238999999999997}
{"chunk": "here oh that's yeah so for those of you who can't see the camera uh his ball almost hit the ceiling that right in front of us it went straight up in the", "start": 1684.679, "duration": 16.561}
{"chunk": "air and obviously the mat has a little bit to do with that but that ball launches straight up in the air so all we're going to focus on right now and", "start": 1693.36, "duration": 16.88}
{"chunk": "this tip is in order to get the golf ball to launch lower we're just going to focus strictly on the energy we put into the swing okay so like for That Swing", "start": 1701.519, "duration": 18.801000000000002}
{"chunk": "there that felt like full gas as as hard as you can hit a wedge yeah right so hit one at 50% of that okay so when you say that though it's going to be full range", "start": 1710.84, "duration": 17.238}
{"chunk": "of motion full range of motion this swing is going to be a full swing but the tempo the energy you put into the swing is going to be about half yeah so immediately off the club", "start": 1720.039, "duration": 19.441}
{"chunk": "face launches a little bit lower I mean the window that that golf ball comes out of is going to be completely different and the moment that thing hit the ground at one hop and stopped and that was with", "start": 1731.72, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "a range ball right so go face on here for the camera so really the big thing that this speed this Tempo in a wedge", "start": 1740.44, "duration": 19.0}
{"chunk": "will do is as Travino swings the club into impact the slower you swing the", "start": 1749.279, "duration": 15.641}
{"chunk": "more the hands stay in front of the club so that angle that the club comes in at the ball is going to be a little is going to be a little steeper the loft of", "start": 1757.76, "duration": 16.2}
{"chunk": "the club is going to decrease just a little bit but you're going to get that Golf Club to launch at a more consistent basis so off the golf ball it's going to", "start": 1766.36, "duration": 15.16}
{"chunk": "come out a little lower whereas if you swung as fast as you can these hands are going to want to release yeah you've and now now you've added Loft to it and the", "start": 1773.76, "duration": 16.519}
{"chunk": "rate of release is going to change from swing to swing yeah so sometimes it may be there sometimes it may be there which is why you get that unpredictability", "start": 1781.919, "duration": 16.161}
{"chunk": "yeah like you're saying if however quick my arms and hands are firing that's so much added speed at the bottom like rather than", "start": 1790.08, "duration": 17.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "and it's and it's unpredictable speed so you don't know if my club's going to release too much if it's going to release a little bit Yeah so we're really focusing on can I maintain that", "start": 1798.36, "duration": 20.159}
{"chunk": "that shaft angle can I keep my hands in front of the club for as long as possible because that launch angle is what's going to keep that club down right guess let's do another one at 50%", "start": 1808.559, "duration": 20.76}
{"chunk": "yep just 50% flight down oh those are nice yeah that was better yeah that launch like the curvature I know wedge supposed to curve", "start": 1818.12, "duration": 16.599999999999998}
{"chunk": "a lot there's a lot of speed for me personally it's really easy to throw the hands and then I oh it's easy to see the face is coming in open comeing in shut that one was on a line so it makes me", "start": 1829.48, "duration": 19.4}
{"chunk": "feel more aggressive when I'm in these scoring yardages really easy to see that golf ball curve a ton so I think my biggest biggest piece of advice and the one thing to focus on is if you struggle", "start": 1839.0, "duration": 18.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "with launching wedges at a consistent basis consciously pay attention to the the speed and the energy you're putting into your swing and I would play around", "start": 1848.2, "duration": 18.121000000000002}
{"chunk": "with let's swing it at about 50% rate yeah still full range of motion full swing but keep that Tempo that energy down to about 50% and just notice what", "start": 1856.84, "duration": 17.799}
