{"chunk": "this is hip rotation yeah like when you're doing those hip circles in the morning stretch exactly exactly so hip rotation is just a joint yeah right you", "start": 161.04, "duration": 15.479000000000003}
{"chunk": "got the femur that sticks up into the pelvis and that's bang so how it's rotating in here that's all hip rotation when we're looking at the golf swing", "start": 168.72, "duration": 16.021}

{"chunk": "often talk about either like active or passive movement or activity so what you just explained is beautiful Alex because you're talking about an", "start": 213.599, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "active movement coming from like the upper spiral or the chest or the ribs or the thoracic region and then the pelvis responds to that so if you go in here", "start": 223.56, "duration": 16.02}

{"chunk": "this right hip socket yeah it worked towards me yes right yes it's working in this space here yes okay great so if you set up again", "start": 238.92, "duration": 17.758999999999997}
{"chunk": "what we'll sometimes see that's that's inappropriate go ahead and start actively rotating the pelvis there you go okay so what that does is", "start": 248.28, "duration": 16.139}
{"chunk": "it slacks out the spirals and it whacks out the whole system yeah and Kyle our awesome strength and conditioning coordinator down here talks about", "start": 256.079, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "dissociation with a lot of our athletes what's dissociation by the way yeah dissociation is whether if you're focusing upper or lower but one of them", "start": 263.58, "duration": 16.441}

{"chunk": "got to feeling that stretch yeah exactly so we've got dissociating the pelvis or we've got dissociating the rib correct right so it's super important because", "start": 280.5, "duration": 16.439}
{"chunk": "we'll see a lot of people because of this like inappropriate map in their mind because they're trying to have with all the information that we", "start": 288.72, "duration": 17.041}
{"chunk": "throw out there we want to see this is the main engine and the arms almost respond to that but people will cheat right kind of that fake turn they go oh", "start": 297.36, "duration": 16.62}
{"chunk": "it's getting open but like a big thing I'll pick up especially in the virtual space is you know in general in golf depth depth", "start": 305.4, "duration": 15.899999999999999}
{"chunk": "depth got to get it so they go okay but now this guy locked out and this actually stalls rotation so now it's Earth with the arms and they go why am I", "start": 313.32, "duration": 16.34}
{"chunk": "all whacked out yeah it just feels like massively inappropriate right I mean it's cool because they're trying to do something but that's again we just throw", "start": 321.54, "duration": 19.54}
{"chunk": "out this term like depth yeah how okay well you can get deep with a lot of different things you can throw your hands back there they're deep you could rotate the chest it can get deep you", "start": 330.96, "duration": 17.04}
{"chunk": "could rotate the pelvis depth depth depth it's just a false it's like just a word that doesn't really course it's got to be better to find like what", "start": 340.02, "duration": 16.858999999999998}
{"chunk": "exactly in depth are we looking for at least in our realm because it's different for everybody that's such a good point so like kind of going down", "start": 348.18, "duration": 16.380000000000003}
{"chunk": "this Rabbit Hole the pelvis the only active thing we're looking for the pelvis to do within our system is to", "start": 356.22, "duration": 16.02}

{"chunk": "you'll see how the pelvis in space moves this way yeah kind of that like 45 degree space exactly so it moved into", "start": 374.039, "duration": 15.241}

{"chunk": "just going to fall into a seat yes right that's all it is so it's not this like massively complex thing but we see it lower obviously and work away from this", "start": 391.319, "duration": 19.801}
{"chunk": "space where the golf ball is to me so if I'm dropping I'm moving the pelvis away from this space yes massively important", "start": 400.68, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "that also pairs really well with the spiral line and how the spiral is working up back and Away into this space as well it's working away from you yeah", "start": 409.02, "duration": 18.299}
{"chunk": "so you could think of the golf swing like super simple in that the spiral leads so if you go ahead and show that good there's the upper spiral now we", "start": 418.199, "duration": 17.401}
{"chunk": "would drop good and now we're going to spiral out into finish that's the main engine but you have to be aware of it right and", "start": 426.78, "duration": 17.34}
{"chunk": "that's what creates this awesome opportunity for proper depth yes active rotator active dropper also in regards to the", "start": 435.9, "duration": 19.079}
{"chunk": "pelvis let's talk about the femur so this is leg action so we'll go back into hip rotation yeah so if we follow the spiral line", "start": 445.319, "duration": 15.181}
{"chunk": "and I'm pulling this upper spiral upper spiral up a spiral what's actually happening and this is trippy this knee is pointing on this angle so", "start": 452.88, "duration": 20.7}
{"chunk": "this is 90 degrees is a little bit more over here and as I turn the upper spiral it pulls on the pelvis eventually and now this", "start": 463.08, "duration": 17.46}
{"chunk": "kneecap the patella is pointing out this direction so it looks like it's internal rotation yeah but it's not because the pelvis like the", "start": 471.72, "duration": 20.94}
{"chunk": "the difference between how far like where my pelvis is pointing like perpendicular yeah here", "start": 481.86, "duration": 16.679000000000002}
{"chunk": "to the kneecap as I turn turn turn turn turn look at how much more this has moved like this space is black", "start": 489.96, "duration": 15.241000000000001}
{"chunk": "external yeah they didn't follow each other proportionally exactly this one moved external this one moved internal because of the active rotation well it's", "start": 498.3, "duration": 18.778}
{"chunk": "passive rotation in the pelvis but the pelvis rotated and so the legs respond to that yeah but what's really important here and you just brought this up which", "start": 507.539, "duration": 17.221}
{"chunk": "is a really really key piece is we we love this idea of people being able to rotate through the strike meaning the chest is rotating", "start": 516.12, "duration": 16.381}
{"chunk": "well we're rotating through the strike so that means from like this P5 ish phase all the way through P9 we're rotating", "start": 524.7, "duration": 16.14}
{"chunk": "but until I get to P5 I'm not I need to stay in this space over here and so if we follow the spiral line like just in", "start": 531.42, "duration": 16.019}
{"chunk": "in Gate patterns you can do this with me Alex yeah so if we just take a step towards the camera here okay with yep we'll go boom with this left foot okay", "start": 540.6, "duration": 20.22}
{"chunk": "this spiral that goes underneath this this like lead armpit for us is going to start to pull pull pull pull pull and that's what's dragging this hip socket", "start": 550.019, "duration": 16.861}
{"chunk": "towards the target to drag the foot there you go and so that spiral the lower Spiral goes down the IT band which is the outer portion of your leg and so", "start": 559.08, "duration": 17.699}
{"chunk": "as you're pulling pulling pulling pulling pulling eventually there goes the heel see how this heel gets spun away yeah that direction Yeah the more I", "start": 568.26, "duration": 16.321}
{"chunk": "pull the more it would the more it spins exactly now let's go back here again okay step with the other foot", "start": 575.88, "duration": 15.54}
{"chunk": "boom okay now from there as you start to pull pull pull pull see where that heel got tossed yeah gets tossed away okay so remember that thought yeah okay go back", "start": 583.14, "duration": 18.78}
{"chunk": "go to like neutral address for uh for golf posture so start pulling pulling pulling pulling okay where's that heel gonna get tossed", "start": 592.8, "duration": 16.5}
{"chunk": "I keep going it's going to want to there's some point good and so now as you re-center boom into P5 see how", "start": 601.8, "duration": 15.06}
{"chunk": "you're still in this space yeah so the femur what's going on here is it is moved into a space where it's working", "start": 609.12, "duration": 17.519}
{"chunk": "external but it tosses the heel away but the shape that the femur is in right here we're not going to actively start to rotate this away that's a big thing I", "start": 617.279, "duration": 19.080000000000002}
{"chunk": "see everyone's huge thing Sneed drill right we'll drop the bucket yeah well that is an active dual external action", "start": 627.12, "duration": 15.181000000000001}
{"chunk": "with the femers which is like an extremely weak you slack out the spiral line the whole bit just goes the pot yeah it's hard to turn with these guys won't turn whether it's passive or", "start": 635.04, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "active and it's like exactly so yeah like a lot like tiger zolte didn't activate my glutes and everybody makes", "start": 642.66, "duration": 15.059999999999999}
{"chunk": "fun of them for it well he's extremely correct but what he's really talking about is the spiral line", "start": 650.04, "duration": 15.959}
{"chunk": "which goes down glute Mead and kind of into like comes back up into glute Max actually and up through you so like your", "start": 657.72, "duration": 17.581}
{"chunk": "glute like the whole complex is part of the freaking spiral line yeah you got to use them exactly so as soon as you do this you slack out the spiral line no", "start": 666.6, "duration": 16.32}
{"chunk": "more glutes so what do I end up doing extend throw blah blah blah just as a wax system yeah it's kind of like there's matchups with the body and it's like I think it's like glute ABS or like", "start": 675.3, "duration": 19.439}
{"chunk": "hamstrings back exactly the hamstrings back is more like the extension glute core is more of that flexion and allows you to rotate even like you're saying if", "start": 684.899, "duration": 15.72}
{"chunk": "it gets slacked out yep this shuts off or doesn't activate so then it's like okay this is all I have left yeah and you're talking about like front chain", "start": 692.579, "duration": 16.86}
{"chunk": "compared to back chain dominance right that we want to be in back chain for as long as we possibly can because we're stake we stay dropped in we stay active", "start": 701.339, "duration": 16.560000000000002}
{"chunk": "into the spiral okay so the purpose of this exercise is to look at all right I'm here I'm here I'm here there goes", "start": 708.899, "duration": 16.741}
{"chunk": "the heel as I plant there's the re-center because my my rib system we call it rib sway we're dropping here at the same time", "start": 717.42, "duration": 16.74}
{"chunk": "boom I'm back into the space where I'm into the lead side but this femur shape the rotation that it has here has been", "start": 726.36, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "external for a heck of a lot of time because of the shape of the Spiral as I drop in and now I bounce into the other spiral now I'm working into internal", "start": 734.16, "duration": 19.259}
{"chunk": "rotation you're turning into that femur correct yes so the pelvis because the upper spiral is pulling it is now being", "start": 743.459, "duration": 16.559}

{"chunk": "out the spiral because of just tossing this inappropriately external I got nothing yeah so that's why people extend because at least I can like shoot energy", "start": 776.94, "duration": 15.658999999999999}
{"chunk": "this way whereas if I'm here boom that can turn and hit so like if we just follow", "start": 785.339, "duration": 15.241}
{"chunk": "spirals or second Global law you'll start to see that the heels the only thing that they do is they get tossed", "start": 791.82, "duration": 15.119}
