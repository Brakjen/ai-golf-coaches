{"chunk": "patterns all the time. I'll bring up Havland all the freaking time. If you guys know me at all, you know how much I just love Havlin's action. Um, and then", "start": 22.64, "duration": 17.679}
{"chunk": "I'll bring up other guys like swinger patterns like um, obviously Sheffller, you've got guys like uh, uh, Jimmy", "start": 31.599, "duration": 15.600000000000001}
{"chunk": "Walker here. Um, Nicholas was a swinger pattern as well. And so instead of me just standing up here and talking about", "start": 38.719, "duration": 17.921}
{"chunk": "like this is what what it kind of looks like in a in a hitter pattern, this is a swinger pattern, and I'm inevitably just", "start": 47.92, "duration": 15.919}
{"chunk": "showing that through my own mannerisms. What I'd really like to do today is actually take a look at these two athletes, Jimmy Walker and Victor", "start": 55.6, "duration": 18.641}
{"chunk": "Havlin, and compare them and really study why each system can work. And obviously they're two great players. I", "start": 65.04, "duration": 15.280000000000001}
{"chunk": "mean they've had uh very long careers on the PGA Tour uh with a ton of success. So who am I to say that one is better", "start": 72.72, "duration": 15.2}
{"chunk": "than the other? Uh we obviously have preferences. Our main reason for the preference uh is first and foremost", "start": 80.4, "duration": 15.76}
{"chunk": "preventative medicine where we're moving in a way that's it's it's very difficult to create injury in a certain pattern and then other patterns. I mean, we can", "start": 88.32, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "just see now uh where injury tends to come from um when it comes to how you move in in your golf swing. And then we also have different preferences with", "start": 97.52, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "like how fast the the club face rotates through the strike, heavy ROC, rate of closure, uh increases the likelihood for", "start": 106.56, "duration": 19.198}
{"chunk": "the athlete to hit crooked shots, catastrophic misses. So, for certain patterns that slow down that ROC rate of closure, that would obviously be a great", "start": 116.399, "duration": 19.761999999999997}
{"chunk": "thing. since inevitably we are playing a racket sport. Your ability to control the club face as a golfer is pretty darn", "start": 125.84, "duration": 17.36}
{"chunk": "important. And then we have other pieces and other aspects like h how you control low point is much different for each one", "start": 134.8, "duration": 15.92}
{"chunk": "of these athletes. Um and one can potentially be a little bit easier than the other. Again, obviously we've got a cat over here and it's going to and it's", "start": 142.16, "duration": 15.199000000000002}
{"chunk": "going to sound like I'm going to throw all kinds of shade at swinger type patterns. again, Nicholas, Jimmy Walker, these guys are great players. Sheffller", "start": 150.879, "duration": 19.761}
{"chunk": "obviously is a great player. So, it's definitely going to come across like I'm throwing shade at those types of swings because, of course, I definitely do have", "start": 160.08, "duration": 17.12}
{"chunk": "a preference when it comes to movement. But again, at the end of the day, what we're really going to study in this video is how one swing and those", "start": 168.8, "duration": 17.119}
{"chunk": "matchups, how they move their arms, how they move their entire engine, pelvis, rib cage, spine, blah blah blah, how those two different systems match up", "start": 177.599, "duration": 18.081}
{"chunk": "or balance out. So, with that being said, let's take a look. We'll start over here with Jimmy Walker", "start": 186.56, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "and um just just study again how he he generally moves. So, if I just play this And what I'd like you to take a look at", "start": 193.76, "duration": 16.24}
{"chunk": "is just everything. You're just taking a a general look at how Jimmy is is really moving. I mean, you can take a look at", "start": 204.879, "duration": 17.521}
{"chunk": "obviously the top of a swing here, where the arm structure is, where his rib cage, where his pelvis um is in space. And then as soon as I I let him work", "start": 213.44, "duration": 17.92}
{"chunk": "into the forward swing here, take a look at his feet, where his pelvis is, where his rib cage is, how the golf club works through the strike. Okay. And then", "start": 222.64, "duration": 16.559}
{"chunk": "second, if we take a look over here at Havland and how he moves through the strike, we're going to see a much different", "start": 230.319, "duration": 18.162}
{"chunk": "action there. If you take a look at at his feet, um at uh at his at his legs,", "start": 241.76, "duration": 15.279}
{"chunk": "at at his pelvis, his rib cage, everything here. I mean, they're two very very different looks uh when when", "start": 248.72, "duration": 15.52}
{"chunk": "we're looking at the golf swing. So when you hear us talk about engine, when I'm speaking to engine, I'm talking about", "start": 256.799, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "the spine primarily. If you want to geek out a little bit, you'll start to look at spine engine theory. Um, and what", "start": 265.199, "duration": 16.16}
{"chunk": "this theory suggests is that all movement originates in the spine and then gets expressed outward from there.", "start": 273.919, "duration": 18.241}
{"chunk": "So the the the the next closest systems, if you will, to the spine, obviously your head sits up on top of your spine. You got the rib cage that really", "start": 281.6, "duration": 17.2}
{"chunk": "attaches into the spine and in many different ways, especially in the posterior, obviously. And then you've got your pelvis. So how I move my spine", "start": 291.6, "duration": 15.84}
{"chunk": "in space is going to dictate where my pelvis moves, where my rib cage moves, where my", "start": 299.44, "duration": 16.478}
{"chunk": "head moves in space, and then it leaks out from there. If we look at the legs, it gets into the upper legs, into the femurss, goes down through the lower", "start": 307.759, "duration": 15.122}
{"chunk": "legs and into the feet. So, we'll see how each of these athletes, their foot action changes drastically and dramatically. And what I would also", "start": 315.36, "duration": 18.72}
{"chunk": "suggest, like if you're watching this video for the very first time and you kind of don't know our stick, there's a ton of other videos on our in our", "start": 324.8, "duration": 16.479}
{"chunk": "library here on our YouTube. one of the the uh the closest videos like in uh in time", "start": 332.8, "duration": 16.48}
{"chunk": "that we've done like a very recent video that we've done. Jackson and I actually did a video on athletic traits uh in", "start": 341.12, "duration": 15.441}
{"chunk": "movement. Um and it ties directly in with what we're going to see in Havlin's pattern. Okay. So, let's let's take a", "start": 348.4, "duration": 15.119}
{"chunk": "look at uh Jimmy Walker here first and kind of break this down. So, let's start with and and what we're", "start": 356.24, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "really going to take a look at is is more more so the forward swing here. Let's start with his upper arms and his", "start": 364.479, "duration": 16.481}
{"chunk": "rib cage and how those two elements really work together. So, if we start to to to take a look at this with Jimmy as he starts to work forward, what you'll", "start": 372.24, "duration": 17.599}
{"chunk": "see is is the rib cage here as he gets into this kind of P5 section here all the way into the strike. What you'll see", "start": 381.039, "duration": 18.801}
{"chunk": "is his rib cage almost stops rotating and moves more into a lateral bend type of an action. So what he is doing", "start": 389.28, "duration": 19.68}
{"chunk": "inevitably is he is taking his arms and rotating them through the strike", "start": 400.72, "duration": 19.44}
{"chunk": "here as his rib cage stops rotating works up and works into a lateral bend in his right side. So, what we're going", "start": 409.68, "duration": 15.838}
{"chunk": "to see out of this kind of a player, a swinger type of pattern is a player once they swing it to the", "start": 417.759, "duration": 16.322}
{"chunk": "top, his rib cage starts to rotate a bit and transition, but then from here it'll work up and back into this trailside", "start": 425.44, "duration": 17.68}
{"chunk": "bend so he can take his upper arms, especially if we're looking at the lead upper arm. It lowers and externally rotates to square the golf club. So when", "start": 434.88, "duration": 18.238}
{"chunk": "I swing it to the top, even if I rotate a bit, but my intuition is to go ahead and express the golf club and square the golf club to the golf ball in this type", "start": 444.319, "duration": 15.601999999999999}
{"chunk": "of a manner. See how much rotation there is here in the upper arms. My rib cage works up and back to go ahead and express that golf club to the golf ball.", "start": 452.24, "duration": 19.199}
{"chunk": "So when I do that, we'll we'll talk about the pelvis here a little bit more, but see how the pelvis is migrated quite a ways forward towards the target. My", "start": 461.52, "duration": 16.721}
{"chunk": "rib cage is up and tilted back here to go ahead and express the golf club to the golf ball. So, what we're seeing when we're looking at the upper arms", "start": 470.0, "duration": 15.68}
{"chunk": "relative to the rib cage is we'll see the rib cage stop its rotation. It elevates, laterally, bends. So, now I can go ahead and square the golf club", "start": 477.68, "duration": 17.84}
{"chunk": "with a lot of rotation in the upper arms. That's obviously going to leak down into the hands as well and into the", "start": 486.96, "duration": 15.838000000000001}
{"chunk": "lower arms. So, we'll see more rotation, pronation, and supenation in the in the lower arms as well to go ahead and start", "start": 493.919, "duration": 15.282}

{"chunk": "the pattern that we're seeing out of a swinger type of pattern. Okay. The way that those athletes are squaring the", "start": 537.44, "duration": 15.199}
{"chunk": "golf club is heavy in their arm rotation, they are not going to rotate the rib cage as much as a hitter type pattern", "start": 544.32, "duration": 21.121}

{"chunk": "and we'll get him up here to the top. Okay. And all we're going to study here, we're not going to necessarily look at his pelvis yet. We're just going to take a look at his rib cage and the upper", "start": 563.68, "duration": 18.198999999999998}

{"chunk": "to trap back away from the target line. And so we'll see more of this out of swinger type patterns this luck compared to a havland who you'll see a heck of a", "start": 646.16, "duration": 17.438000000000002}
{"chunk": "lot more of this. So if you look at my shoulder axis here, this lead shoulder is rotating and pulling away from where the golf ball is. Look at how much", "start": 654.959, "duration": 19.201}

{"chunk": "protracting the scap and now it looks like my rib cage is shut off. I didn't do anything to my ribs here. This is all in the scaps and in the shoulders. And I", "start": 682.56, "duration": 15.36}

{"chunk": "a look at where the anacubital fossa is pointing here. The anacubital is the opposite side of my elbow. So if I take this anticubital that right now is more", "start": 740.56, "duration": 17.279}
{"chunk": "or less pointing towards the camera and I point it away from the target, this is a direct reflection of internal or", "start": 749.36, "duration": 15.521}

{"chunk": "we're taking a look at Jimmy as well, what's interesting is they're super very similar looks in each athlete right", "start": 925.519, "duration": 15.919999999999998}

{"chunk": "the rib cage here. This is more or less resembling, okay, the trunk line. If we look at Jimmy pelvis, rib cage, look at", "start": 1040.88, "duration": 20.240000000000002}
{"chunk": "how much more tilt there is in his trunk line. Now, tilt is one of these funny words. I almost hate using it. The", "start": 1050.32, "duration": 16.159}
