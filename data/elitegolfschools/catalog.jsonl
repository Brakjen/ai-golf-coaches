Even in this day of quantitative coaching, you still must have a way to qualify how you get to 'the number'.\n\nIn this video, Jackson and Riley explain a few techniques that can provide a better understanding of athletics in our game. Using a few principles from GOATA and David Weck, they break down the feet, legs, pelvis, spine, and ribs in order for viewers to understand concepts like early extension, shallowing, pressure shifts, and more.\n\nHold onto your seatbelts because, as usual, we're diving into the weeds in order to truly understand the golf swing and human movement!\n\n#golfswing #golfcoach #golfinstruction", "published_at": "2025-09-09T11:40:56+00:00", "duration_seconds": 2174, "is_livestream": false, "is_podcast": false, "channel_id": "UCePCyXFuu_B-8bPuY-cvn4Q", "channel_title": "Elite Golf Schools"}
