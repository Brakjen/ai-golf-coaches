## AI Golf Coach Development

### Step 1: Data Retrieval
We will retrieve transcriptions from Youtube videos from select channels:
- Elite Golf Schools (@elitegoolfschools)
- Milo Lines Golf (@milolinesgolf)

We will use the Youtube Data API from Googole to fetch transcripts for all videos
from each channel.
Some limitations:

- We are only interested in the long form videos, not the "Shorts".
- Elite Golf Schools have some Livestream long for videos. These are live Question and Answer sessions where the instructor answers questions from viewers. We also want these videos, but they need to be flagged as "livestream" or something similar.


### Step 2: Indexing


### Step 3: Agent Definitions
