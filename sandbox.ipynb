      "okay what's up guys hey uh we're super excited pumped because uh a little bit of a presence on a couple of different platforms Tick Tock and Instagram this gentleman TJ kathenberg really spearheading that but gonna start doing some longer form YouTube style um try to help people further their gangs through YouTube so what are we talking about well I think if we're going to start with some you know one of the main things you got to learn how to do is move face stability gotta be able to do that well before you go down but it's just like kind of thrown out like hey you need the opposite issue with your impacts because not really an explanation Beyond just that like make sure your impacts will make sure your hips are open super Limited so why don't we start with this go ahead and set up to a shot here team impact we're not talking about a specific point in space and then like right here p7 is impact you talk a lot about like everything in order so if players can start to see that impact would really be sort of go all the way to like P6 which would be shown level to the ground again somewhere in this general area all the way through p7 8 which is shaft low under the ground again that's what we mean by impaired so it's a rather large phase so not just here at all exactly because I could have the phase look relatively relatively square right here go ahead and go into like in one area okay and so right here Bang Club face is fairly squared but if then I look another foot and the club face looks like that we could have problems right in essence she's just happened to guess okay and p7 and then one it's ridiculous yeah so looking at things more from this uh perspective of like just through the impact area would be very very young um in your opinion in your mind having to organize the face and balance out the face during that P6 to PA phase sure I mean so if we look at this little P6 area like you said Chapel looking for a few things here like I don't want to be approaching the golf ball with the face okay well because then I can't really rotate the chest well to get the collective impact how about the club phase so I would have to like whereas if I'm in here with the face relatively Square spine angle somewhere pointed around toe down right then I can turn here nice speed yeah acquisition and I think one thing if you go to that karate one that you're just explaining what it faces is open what we often see actually is an extension where the pelvis will come and be the spine goes up and that's what rapidly closes the face because in essence you need to stop rotation to square it so now I can fling it but if you if you're in a good spot like you were go back there again okay and you were to just like trying to rotate this down you're going to run into a problem because you run out of room so that's why we see this massive late extension light throw the square of the face yeah exactly and the front face would look like as well so having regular rotation tons of extension through the strike and again it's just like guesswork and that's right you might guess right once in a while if you get this flusher but you don't know the actual credit exactly the very next way on the Range it feels exactly the same place so great so go back there again so we'd like to see the the face a little bit down how are you doing that generally speaking how did you organize to there at peace when I take this thing so I organize the face early take it up around this top of the backswing finish position right yeah what kind of body stuff do I need to go ahead and fall into this organized position yes we'd love to see little drops in the back up there T4 awesome so a little drop especially this Trail hips the pelvis just Falls TJ is really good at this in the back string go back to P4 beautiful seed out shape right here so now we want to go from this Bend to the back bend and drop and bounce into that bend now you're in this Trail Bend like you can see all the wrinkles in the TJ's shirt like this bent here like right underneath that Bobcat and there is to some degree shoulder extension which is the arm is firing down to get the golf club down down they do need to come down to something okay all right so now we've got the face kind of toe down you're already up in good bends you've dropped a little bit so if you just simply keep the same amount of Bend and turn the chest super simple late like from p six P 5.5 somewhere in there what we want students to just generally this is what they're doing is they're using that upper spiral ing about so right up in here from this position it's all exactly yep so and in general you can think of like everybody talks about hip rotation first of all it's a long term analogy because hip rotation is the femur rotating in the socket so it's really pelvic rotation that we're seeing pelvic rotation that's so you can think of like two different systems and got ripped down this pelvic system the rib system okay group system is the rotate the pelvic system is the drop does it rotate sure passive rotation because of the ribs because it can't just stay it's got to fall on the rift exactly there you see that this is the main engine yeah sure a bit but it wasn't my first exactly what that just did the pelvic rotation causes early yeah yeah a lot of people get this idea that hits yep exactly because the rate of rotation goes up typically for good players there's a lot of Bend like low spine Bend to go ahead and like encounter that so that now I low Point gets whacked out block I got to do all kinds of makeup yes manipulations right right you're fits the screw up that you did when you heard so yeah rotator ribs dropper helmets so that's can you remind us the main thing about this is just so if I'm going rotate see there's a point where okay the ribs are rotating but now if I keep rotating the ribs the pelvis gets drug along so from right here if I just drop there's my there's my trail head if I drop the pelvis and then use my ribs to rotate to the other side now the pelvis rotate did I start to expand sure but it's late and it's gradual extension trailing it's appropriate extension okay so that's really good uh teach because I think just better understanding where rotation comes from look at the front face you generally look like all of that stuff is helpful but then we need to find a way to put it into action so drill wise let's walk through what we call progression so the way that we do this guys is you go into a generally a nice position and then from here you're going into a mock impact position so this is going to go into account piece of piece and stuff from right there let's drop the pelvis and you're going to use the spiral to rotate the chest of an impact so if you do that again teach just drop us and rotate the spiral at the same time or rotate the chest at the same time so it's like you go good so what you'll see TJ's chest is plenty about a 45 degree angle out in front of the golf ball so our more Target side here you'll see this beautiful shape he's kind of bent out right here and you'll see that he still has some amount of Trailhead flexion okay so from right there how TJ is going to get out of here is really important so in his mind he's coming right back into this generally same position through this strike area spiral to rotate him away so let's go ahead and see that beautiful and if you do that again bud what's really cool here start rotating the chest so the chest goes and then here come the arms leg keep rotating the chest boom so if we do it improperly go back in there again you'll see players just fire These Arms out and the ribs aren't the lead the ribs need to lead so the ribs go go here come from there he'll just drop and start to turn the chest back into the golf ball bang and there's image preset okay so let's go back here again now let's see it in one action or one motion right drop turn there's the preset exercise okay there's a couple of things that you can do as well um because we we see this quite often where we love rotation through the strike so much the players will early rotate typically that throws the golf club and the center of a massive Club over now you got to fix it late yeah if you're a good player so what we need this is just general geometry where the club is going back into that preset drop boom so he's right here excellent so now show just a little back swinging right here and then from from there we want the club to go over here so it falls under the plank in this transition phase and we're going to do that primarily by bouncing this virus or getting into this Trail again so when it does that there's that big heavy bag to color feel it right here's the player yep exactly and you see how the golf club went under the plane now so now you can rotate back into the strike so that's so much better yeah exactly rather than even those like the first one that you showed is a little bit fat you're super good player you know where this is supposed to be at the strike so it's easier to early rotate light fix when we bottom activity yep exactly so let's see that again kind of slow-mo so we go into that preset p7 drop there's the turn on General the club goes up on top of the plan it'll fall under those are beautiful so much covered up so now you feel as the athlete that through the strike you're rotating a rotation of the chest is what stabilizes the face will rotate it you got to have the club underneath the plan it's got to get back here get back there before here and we rotate we're good yeah yeah that's excellent all right so maybe we can talk about some like common things um yeah right yep so one that I see a lot is fast for one like like on this Trail foot yeah when you start to try to bounce yep okay yep so perfect so two different ways to bend so go ahead and hug them off the rotation so there's two different ways to bend one is just generally if I just go this way okay where do you feel a lot of that pressure go right back exactly so see where he is he's pointing it out it's in this area here that's all generally speaking else mine right right or teaspoon so no good not a healthy action even though your spine did then pretty pretty inefficient way to do things because the other thing about the type of band this way the center of mass of the ribs again we're looking for looking for the ribs the lowest ribs on up to the top of his head is a section right to pay attention to the center of mass of that area now is all the way back in this Trail so you we prefer to see is what we call Rib sway so in essence TJ is going to keep this shaft relatively level to the ground and if we were to just drive the ribs up there we go see how now the center of mass of the ribs is now up over the top of the Lead Foot yeah pressure is completely different the pressure's completely different and now if you take a look at where TJ's sternum is the sternum is forward of where the golf ball was and where the sternum is from a face-on perspective where it is in space at the moment of a strike is going to dictate the bottom okay so instead of going preset so go ahead and run the preset we want our balance bands instead of bouncing the bands this way okay go back into D7 again preset we're going to go away rib sway there we go so now his Center of mass is all the way up Center of mass and the ribs is up over the top or in on this InStep of this deep foot so now if you return beautiful way further up there yeah especially for good players like you'll feel like okay whatever yeah boom so that rib sway that you're talking about is is that then yes so that's Ben wherever so and all of that bin by the way like now just pressure wise where do you feel the pressure when your ribs swing more more so in the upper upper side we're talking this area here so it's kind of like hit here yep yep yep exactly exactly so what's trippy is even though TJ is moving left he's going into lightning Trail cycle compared to having to move right to get a car so when people say this Trailside band they usually just move this way yep give their bottom not way too far behind exactly because you just saw us goes up here to just balance it out yeah it's like a bounce ribs go here the pelvis goes there but at the ribs in here where the pelvis Land There Goes actually yeah so let's hit one still the same like little preset exercise okay you're gonna go away little rips way will help the golf club fall not only underneath the plane but it'll also get your center of mass bar enough up balance beautiful amount of energy so that's one one that I see is Lake tug with the arms okay so when you say late tuck with the arms so just because pulling on the arms is something that we see out of like an extension tilt pattern right we'll see players rotate the pelvis which creates Trail hip extension tilt with the ribs for good players so now there's that bend that we're talking about where the bottom up to get up here so I've got to take the arms and just drag the handle far enough up here to control my bottom up to some guy yeah so it's like a leftover left over after Wards as well players will tend to do is the face like if I just take the handle and pull it this direction instead so players will generally move well or they're in this p7 position that's nice work away get into good bins here and now just take this as they turn they'll just pull the handle up get shots that are like either fat or the face stays wide open right it's like this late run of energy in the arms time there's tug so if we get this like late tug like abduct abducted move and all that you're doing is taking the grip and just pulling into the space this direction right and so at the end of the day what we want is the rotation of the chest creates Boom the club the all the energy in the club goes out so players will actually feel the release in their hands much more than their arms preset I'm away into that right band from right here I'm going to unload the golf club on this plane along with rib rotation so you're actively handling this unloading for some players yes for some players it's not what that would do this they're players that do that for sure and like this drill is generally done at a very low rating energy if I rotate this harder it's tough to keep this energy in here like hold it or maintain this load it'll just have to pass things why it's nice to do things so I can feel how things match up so in essence what we're saying is that from up here into here the matchup is unload from the hands and Bridge located with the rib engine rotation type so if they take this you know handle pulling tug across the chest out of their pattern yep right now they're actually forced to also work the ribcage because I can't do this anymore and the unload by the way is his favorite my favorite like that is is this kind of heavier flexion Libra selection States so now from here feeling it go out like the energy going out through an extension of the lead wrist so what you'll see is the face is more bone right as I start to unload it the rate of rotation of function we're stuck in this pattern half that's when we want to release it it always looks like that that roll you're talking about though but that patterns that's not what I'm doing and it's a matchup for some movement it's a matchup for flexion rotators it's not a matchup for an extension tilt pattern the matchup would be drag and then the length supination with this with this with which supervision is just that heavy heavy rate rotation that's where you get like a high floating right shots with a lot of dark left what is an art investors and they just come at you out of nowhere and that's the frustration that's super frustrating so again just to kind of go through all this we've got like main things to just kind of play around with would be just this drop especially in the trail hip drop and rotate with the ribs to get you into where that preset position generally speaking just understanding where the club is in space as it's moving boom it's up on top the plane under the plane transition and then out as I'm rotating okay and what you were talking about before which is this hinging that I'm rotating the shaft this direction to go ahead and close the face we're feeling like I do that early away boom see where that see where it's at and I don't have to mess with anything so I can just go ribs it's all in one action drop turn up [Music] super simple little shots so now I know what it feels like dynamically to move through this space there's impact P6 or excuse me P5 P6 this whole area all the way the a that's impact now I can feel that even if I'm hitting a full shot I can feel it up oh pattern through the stride because that little preset exercise yeah so impact that's how we do we hope you enjoyed this video as much as we enjoyed making it we're completely new to the YouTube game so don't forget to comment with any suggestions on how we can better this in the future and if you enjoyed this video in particular please like And subscribe because we're gonna be putting these out on a weekly basis for a long long time thank you for watching we'll see you next week\n",
      "we're back we're back and guess what we got some mics here yeah the audio is going to be like a little better I think slightly better than the first one yeah so here we go um all right so second video second video what are we talking about Club face control Club face control you hear about that a lot a lot yes it sounds sexy it sounds sexy um yeah I just think it's something that a lot of people don't do very well um control the club face so I want to understand how to do it today um maybe some practical drills in order to understand it and yeah get right into it absolutely I think that sounds great so Club face control is like one of those big things again in my opinion that's um uh you hear a lot about it but it's like you just they get cast out there like you need to control the face better so like in essence we throw out this problem and then there's no solution really uh the other thing we hear often is like every single person that we work with is like dude you know if I just was a little bit more consistent yes then I'd be so much better basically everyone you're asking what their goals are I want to be more consistent exactly well and what consistency really is is obviously hitting it out of the middle of the face but where that face is pointed through the strike is going to dictate overall dispersion correct right so if we've got a higher rate of rotation in the club face through the strike the chances of the golf ball going further left or further right just Elevate right right so like our favorite Strikers uh I would throw like Victor hoblin in there yep obviously Hogan um and there's a number of guys on tour that you just see like through the impact area as it exits through the ribs that the face is just not rolling over any longer right um and I think that's really important for people just to gen generally understand so that when they go to the range and they're working on their technique that those things actually mean something you're not just like guessing through the strike again that's where the frustration comes from is like I'll hit one and I guess okay and it kind of goes forward and then the next one is like feels the same but because the rate of rotation is so crazy it's like some totally different result and then I'm tick off yeah when you've got snap hook and push fade in your bag that's not necessarily a good combo and straight and high and low just about every combination exactly exactly so let's get into this so um teach why don't you go ahead and set up to this golf ball for us and actually before we do that let's face the camera um and what I want you to do is just show kind of what the risk can do and let's do it without a golf club first just so that we're actually like educating what all all the risks can do because they can do a lot in here so this action of just hinging okay what that does is obviously leverages the golf club straight up in the air okay that's called Rd radial radial deviation if I went the other way that's UD ulnar deviation okay so already yeah so the club's just doing that right so if I just go Rd UD like we call I call it pistol drill if I'm drawing on somebody that would be already put the pistol back in the holster that's UD oh cool okay got it right easy enough to remember yep but what that's doing is it's just leveraging the golf club up and down on this plane you could also go with the trail risk complex so this is right-handed players that way that's extension okay of the rest or I could go this way that's flexion of the wrist what's that making the golf club do be very very Square yeah and it just makes the club go side to side right for sure so this is up and down this is side to side okay got it the other thing that I can do is make this wrist go that way that whole wrist complex is going here it's rotating that's supination okay you remember supination because you're holding a cup of soup got it exactly and the other way that would be pronation that's also different this is in the forearm okay than the upper arm so if I'm doing this this is internal rotation external rotation okay okay so when we're talking pronation supination it's from the elbow down and then would you call this again internal versus external yeah so the humerus is this bone right here okay so if I took you from relatively neutral and rotated you that way I'm rotating you internal that's internal rotation or external rotation of the humerus got it and that's elbow up and that's elbow level okay got it and oftentimes this is kind of interesting topic kind of off on the same topic and off arm action hand action so it's not just hand action it's a hand action right below the elbow there because all this makes this stuff right okay so let's just figure out what in the heck that does with a golf club because we just went over like three different topics in essence so let's hold the golf club right out in front again show me left hand supination would that make the golf club do shut down well what's interesting there is you did a couple of things you supinated and went into flexion oh I see yeah so can I do it with just supinating yep there you go so we're just going so in essence that structure doesn't change at all what you showed at first was that which is confusing because we have so many different ways that we can move these complexes in here oftentimes what you're doing is you're going to add two if not three different actions at one time this is a lot going on it's a blend of actions for sure exactly but again if we just went from neutral see how there's a little a slight amount of extension right here yeah so there's a little cup right there so that's a slight amount of of lead wrist extension if we kept that same amount of extension and supinated you you'd look like that that's what the face just do that shuts it down shuts it down so the rate of rotation is fairly High if we go this way that's RDU d r d u d okay what's the face doing face isn't moving fairly stable right very stable yes okay how about this way this is flexion to extension what's that face doing that's not moving much as well not moving much as well so fairly stable yes both of those actions are fairly stable so rdud is a stable action and flexion extension is a stable action as well exactly and flattened we're talking lead wrist here because sometimes like if I go supination of the lead rest that means the trail rest is pronating got it so they go together exactly if I go extension of the trail rest that means the lead wrist is going into flashing exactly okay yep compared to Rd both going to Rd both going to UD understood yep okay so generally I think it's good to just like better understand everything that can happen from the elbows down again hand action so that's going to dictate a lot of what's going on with the face okay okay the really nice thing about stabilizing the face is what we do really early in the backswing is going to help load these different systems and all these different potentials and based on how you load it it's going to dictate how you unload it okay so you can kind of cheat the system a little bit and then you just load it up early kind of forget about it and then just forget about the unload too because it's just going to get taken care of okay especially if your body's working really well totally different topic for this particular video but if we can just load it really nicely then all of a sudden it's just like you just kind of turn and let it go and it's going to unload in either more stable patterns or more unstable patterns okay totally the Player's Choice but we're here to just educate like how you can go ahead and kind of use these cheat codes to help stabilize the club face right in this particular video so you're kind of saying that club face control starts out like right from the get-go in the golf swing right so you can for sure okay there's some not very many like I could study this a little bit more but the the one pattern that I think of for somebody that actually changes risk conditions from a like a an extension deflection standpoint and transitions like more Cala as it's going up he's got a little bit of flexion in this lead wrist and then it goes into more and more and more and more and more and more crazy more crazy more into there yeah he does a lot of that and that's late that's late I would venture to say that that probably wasn't taught into his system that's just a quirk that's something really freaking cool yeah but it's just what makes more cow morikawa okay right whereas other guys like you watch DJ early in his swing very early he goes super early yep yep and I'm actually curious I would love to talk to DJ about what he actually feels if it's Trail rest or if it's lead wrist if he doesn't feel it at all just because that's DJ who knows but it's a really cool pattern so go ahead and get into setup and also this would be good too face the camera too so you can just show folks kind of grip okay you're almost in like a dual extension pattern at a dress fairly mirror like right boom as you grip it so it's not like we're in flexion here no reflection there no right it's just fairly I think you have a fairly neutral grip right from my standpoint pretty much and that we've got a little bit of extension in both in both wrists okay so here's how we're going to load that system a couple of different ways to feel this I want you to feel the trail rest take that right hand off for me okay and just put it right next to the club good and now from here as you work down the shaft I want the Palm to work down the shaft and work into extension that way there you go so you feel that probably in this whole band load up like this gets stretched out okay okay so go ahead and grip it again and show us that same feel okay great so because of this we've got more extension of the trail rest and this has almost gone into a little bit of flexion and the first two feet three feet of your golf swing right so now we're loaded here we're loaded there these armbands posterior arm line anterior Trail Army got it okay so now if you can view those do that again for us if you can view these as rubber bands you stretch those rubber bands if you were to let go of the rubber bands what would they do right and that's where like if I show it here to the camera yep that's pretty stable super stable now that looks like a flip everyone go you flipped it sure but that's just because I'm not moving my chest along I'm not moving your chest and by the way our terminology that's a stable release okay a flip is pronation supination so again this is supination holding a cup of soup to pronation to pronation so if I show that pattern here yep supination to pronation of the trail rest what the club face do there is the athlete like would you feel like I had no control over it just rapid rapid closing so here's the thing could you hit a straight shot that way yes I would just have to make sure this is lined up at impact but again it's like a guesswork game it's got to be timed up perfectly and by the way there's guys on tour that that do that yeah so it's not that it's wrong and there's another right way you can do that and hit great shots like Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson holy cat the rate of rotation through the strike is like through the roof both exceptional players 100 yeah okay but what we're talking about is like for folks that are looking to either increase stability and have a better blueprint of how to like Club face stabilities is simply like lowering the rate of rotation in the club face and how to do so how to increase that how to decrease that these are simple ways to do so got it okay so let's put this into action um really nice setup okay and show that first like little feel where you're feeling like that Trail Palm is going down there you go excellent now super gentle here you know the load now we know how it's going to unload but from right there just finish your backswing turn and unload it there you go okay so let's set it set it beautiful finish the back swing turn and unload it excellent now you can do I mean there's there's some cool uh like hack motion super awesome it shows like all the things that the wrist can do um certain monitors like flight scope trackman um uh uh g-quad they can show like thresholds right at the moment of the strike it's not really showing like dynamically what's going on here but you can see you'll start to see like oh the club face is 0.2 degrees left on that particular shot and on the next shot is 0.5 degrees right blah blah blah blah but if you hit 20 shots you'll get like this great Baseline and that'll show you kind of like your Raider rotation like if you have 1.2 left and the next one's like 1.2 right that's pretty crazy that's a big big change that's a big dispersion so if you do this and you're going through like an exercise like this you actually put our words to the test and see like hey does that dispersion shrink yeah so your face stability is better okay good right right okay uh what are your favorite drills I just threw out threw one out what do you got well for face stability uh you teach me I just taught you give me that club there you go I mean one of my favorite ones for faceability would be kind of like a mock delivery position okay um so again that's that's been talked about yeah like preset but then come all the way back into a backswing and Float to that honey hole type position yeah so so now this club is behind your rib cage okay so one of my favorite ways to stabilize it is to Simply leave it behind the rib cage and turn right if you kept the chest moving through the strike there actually kept it turning that face is not going to flip over on you so hopefully folks can see what the face looks like there right as I keep turning we can see how that face is gradually it's almost like what I see it as is if the club face had headlights on it and this is like the path is a road yeah I'm more or less just turning to keep the headlights facing the road yeah and that's all you're doing there right you're not really feeling anything in the arms wrist right so compared to if I went back to that same position that honey hole or P5 and then this stalled yes right the arms would keep going I just spun my car out right exactly that's where you're going to get that supination of pronation look is if the chest stops moving right so that that flexion to extension pattern pairs really well with the chest rotation okay right so uh one drill I would have you do is if you want to just go ahead and find that little delivery ask position right okay go ahead and pick the club out up out in front of you okay and just simply set it on your right side of your body so we would almost go Rd to flexion yep and one kind of gradual whoop yeah right and and if I look at the camera here it's just Club faces on the right side of my body right hands are still out in front of me okay yep now from that position if you go and find that position for me so if I'm going wrong yep okay now you would more or less turn your chest on a flat plane so this is not necessarily golf swinging some level your level yeah so you're just going to turn it I want to actually have you turn it around this way I see so now now you can go ahead and find the golf ball through Bend and rotation okay great I love that okay so I'm feeling that there's a little drop here a little drop which kind of helps some systems definitely mine yep and then from here I'm feeling obviously this is turn this is Bend so I'm just kind of blending those together so if I drop and feel that I'm going there absolutely okay great all the while leaving that club on the right side of your body so I'm up here and then feeling that like that's it to get in there okay so if I just hit one like that just a little chippy one so it's up yeah super super you can feel it like in your hands it's cool it just doesn't flip over yeah it never turns over it's just super duper stable so I think one thing that would be kind of fun for folks to do too because at the end of the day like how many people do you play with or coach and they're like you know I really feel like I'm a feel player sure well we all are right like if you're shooting a free throw you better understand like what it feels like to execute that compared to shooting a three-pointer or a seven footer it's all different right so you're feeling that as golfers we better feel what it's like to hit a 150 yard eight iron compared to 130 compared to 180 for some okay right so compared to like okay so that's a stable feel what I just felt what if I did the same thing but from here I just felt this stop to let it go okay so if I go up yeah and you'll see feels so bad but you can sure feel the golf club release yeah in a totally different way you can feel the opposite end of the spectrum there right yeah you can feel like a totally different pattern so like you're motoring it with the chest is huge for stabilizing the face you're huge yeah here's another one I think on that note Luke bracky teaches this often where I love this look tell me what you think of this teach so if I put that there in essence I've got perpendicular lines if I did the same I've got parallel lines okay got it so if I kept those lines parallel oh yeah that's a great visual yeah yeah that's a loop bracky okay right up bang even if I turned see they're almost parallel they're staying the same they stay parallel that's right that's a recipe for Club face stability right recipe for Club face to build and eventually obviously that's going to go we're not just going right it's going to go but as long as the chest keeps motoring that's a great way to like stabilize the club face through the strike and it's a common one I hear a lot right is like they get worried about well when do I actually release the thing if I'm just going to keep the chest moving yep right so when in your mind is the release actually happening it's totally different because yeah well for each player and like driver compared to wedge okay different energy levels a different uh we got different Dynamics out of the golf ball like driver we want High launch low spin you hear about it all the time wedges you want low launch High spin so if I'm going to go low launch I'm sure not rotating this hard to to get the golf club kicked out that's going to hit it high and reduce the spin so you're saying like the harder you rotate this thing the more that energy shoots out of the club head right exactly it's like starts here Works through the arms through the hands out through the golf club so the harder I go here the easier it is to shoot the energy out which is why I'm sure at lower speeds it's easier to feel some of these Club face stability things happen yes another huge top when you're doing things you're learning so much easier to feel like sequencing if you're doing it like one piece at a time like as humans we can we can feel and visualize I do this and then I do this and then I do this like that's sequencing sure but you have to have enough space between each one of those to like I accomplish this now I can move on to the next and then the next if you do everything at high rate of of energy like the sequences just get potentially closer together and it's going to be difficult to feel those changes happen right exactly and what we're talking about is like kind of starting off with low energy that this is rotating I'm keeping the angle from this Trail forearm to the shaft that angle there almost the same as I just turn boom instead of hard here to kick that out sure and now that like all the energy shoots out just starting off with like face stability stuff those couple of exercises are really really good pictures I agree for folks to see and it's like what's cool like what you gave me there was like the chest how it's moving and how that's like associated with the club freaking really cool and then also just understanding what your hands can do and how you load up those different arm lines will help tremendously with just how they naturally unload and then we talked a lot about different I mean anatomical terms and like all these things we even though these are longer videos um there's a lot that we cover I'm sure there's going to be questions write comments down below um any comment that you that you throw out any question that you have we'd be happy to answer those as best we possibly can also we're making lists of different videos that we're going to make we just threw up like 20 or 30 different topics right but we would love your help because the whole purpose of doing these videos is to like help you right with your golf game and so you play better golf so if you have questions send them over we'd be happy to

      "Club head is swinging its Center of Mass on top of the plane and then in this transition piece it needs to go under the plane that's how it's designed we'll talk about why it needs to be here as well especially as we start talking about the body system but it's on top under in transition and then as TJ turns it's going to go out out and go back out through the golf ball all the way up into the Finish [Music] we're already getting some like really awesome questions but kind of Deep dive questions on our YouTube on our Instagram Tick Tock like everywhere where they're we're just throwing information and before like answering questions on those particular like nuts and bolts and zooming in on those let's take a look at the whole car first like global perspective on golf swing and just a general shape that you can see start with this and then we can probably get some great questions from this video let's go um three parts of the golf swing okay in my opinion I'd love to get your take on this because we haven't even talked about this like the topics this video I'm just going to throw some yeah and we're just going to kind of go so three different parts of the golf swing there's the club system okay like how the golf club is designed Luke bracky would talk about geometry like where in space this this thing is swinging okay there's the hands and arm system by the way when we talk about hands it's from the fingertips to the Elbow okay and then from the elbow up into where the humerus sits in the shoulder socket so that's the whole arm and hand system got it okay and then there's the body system I think what most folks have the difficult time with is like where do I start what's a good start point in my opinion for players that are like intermediate to beginner maybe even some kind of touching into advanced looking at the golf club first and how it's designed is like huge a lot of people don't even really know that right yeah because there's all this just crap it's just crap keep your left arm straight keep your left keep your head down even for us upper spirals drop keep the club Behind you if I'm new to the game I'm like what in the hell is all this stuff right because I don't know how the golf club is designed let's start with that just the design and you see all kinds of like everything out there when you look at at golf swings on tour but if we have like you hear about the plane often times right and Hogan has this awesome picture in one of his books it's this like glass sheet that goes right through them like right through here and goes right through the golf ball so this would generally be speaking the plane of the golf swing the golf club is designed in its simplest form to swing on top of the plane so it'd be in this space here this is under the plane on the backswing or in the backswing it swings on top of the plane so let's see that so it swings up in here so you'll see this space like the club generally speaking is a bit outside the hands the club head is swinging its Center of Mass on top of the plane and then in this transition piece it needs to go under the plane that's how it's designed we'll talk about why it needs to be here as well especially as we start talking about the body system but it's on top under in transition and then as TJ turns it's going to go out and go back out through the golf ball all the way up into the Finish okay so like you could think of like the club system it has three pieces to it or three Dynamic phases as well it's on top under out there's three phases in your mind right yep exactly when we're just again we're just looking at like the club system right now we're not talking at all about the hands the arms the body the chest the nothing it's just how the golf club is designed okay on top under out okay so if you hit a ball like that and just play around with it show us just kind of a general neutral one because you have a beautiful golf swing but in essence the club's on top it goes under it goes out excellent okay now this is what's fun there's no perfect golf swing no crazy with it oh you want me to go like well that was a neutral one which is what I asked right so now if I put a sensor right here on this club head yeah let's see it go a little bit more on top under out and you can just play around with this and again you still need the out even if it gets crazy under it still needs to get out okay on top way under out and so it's pretty cool is like that looked a little different than the first one yeah you freaking smushed both of them true right so this is within that it's within that system that you're talking about exactly so and I actually like some of your posts too actually like that sounds like I don't like some of them that's funny I like all of yours but one of them that I really like is especially lately on on the gram you're showing this like the Body Action is like an improper swim like this is an over swim let's see a system where the club yes where the club goes under over okay okay and we'll see if it can even go out and get crazy with this one like it's way under its way under over yep and then you just hit from there yep just Cruise under over so I mean there have been swings that have produced major championships with that pattern however like Ray Floyd is one of them um however there's there's this like over but there's a correction like they'll correct it at some point because you can't you can't keep turning from here right yep exactly the club's not gonna find the ball so the correction happens there for good players for good players yeah for a for a novice it would be going over and they just keep on going over and that's where they hit this like low Pole or like this white floater it just isn't quite correct got it because it's how the golf club and this are designed to interact with one another there's a very efficient way and then there's more complexities on top of that right so the more complex it could be like really Haywire after a while that's why you don't see many golf swings that go under the plane early on the PGA or LPGA Tour no you just don't see it they do exist but it's it's a minority you gotta hunt for them yeah right yep so you'll see you'll see golf swings that are on plane the whole time but I think an on plane swing there was a comment on one of our posts too that this was kind of cool on plane swings are kind of difficult like the one plane swing is kind of tough because in essence you have to more or less keep it on there you don't have a whole lot of wiggle room because if it's on plane and it wants to bump over the plane it's going against the Simplicity of the golf club design so it would be easier to go like well let me get it over behind and out yeah because I've seen little room I've seen that exaggerated by even some players that still play really well but because it's in this system like it seems like it's almost easy from that point yeah right yep and it's because what what you're creating now we're kind of tying in the body system as well here a little bit but once you go on so show that like crazy one it's a delivery like a crazy one to deliver it under and freeze okay there you go so right now the shaft generally speaking is somewhat perpendicular like exactly perpendicular might be like right there this shaft is almost perpendicular to your t-spine right here okay so if you just turned your t-spine and again this is designed to go out you're going to create what's called angular Force so it's like free easy energy based on chest rotation and it keeps the club on its plane as it works out and through this like hit phase so it's like this really simple like through the strike area and that's when when we work with with certain students we're waiting like based on the information we're giving them like we're always going how did that feel how did that feel how did that feel and we're waiting for like the oh my gosh that felt amazing right and they're saying it felt amazing not because of like how pretty the backswing was no or how great they got into honey hole or anything it's from because of how it felt here right yeah they're like oh that felt right they feel like compression it's easy they didn't work that hard the golf club just zooms it feels good yeah right so that's why we like that I think that's a really good place to start with especially for folks that are just starting to like understand get this Baseline understanding of the golf swing let's start distal how the golf club is operating in space and how it's designed in its simplest form start with that and then we can kind of like play with some stuff from there okay got it cool yeah for guys that are more accomplished um what we're looking for is we might start because they have a good understanding of like what the golf club's supposed to do like in this Opera like operating it through the strike they know when it feels good they know when it feels cruddy they're still able to kind of get the golf club on the golf ball but the reason that it feels good at times is because the body system proximal not distal proximal is supporting The Swinging of the arms and the club okay so when we're looking at like the body system I think a really good place to start teach go ahead and set up again would be that the radius or the distance from the the sternum which is that plate right in between like the rib system pretty close to the heart and the distance it is away from the golf ball okay okay so generally speaking we want this energy out out through the arms through the hands through the club through the strike okay so I better keep that away if I'm going to feel the energy go out got it so if that club's getting a little bit further away from me I had better not be getting that sternum closer yes I'm gonna have a lot of problems there right yeah he can't get to it so like you should do that again show right where you were what would you have to do with the arms in the club to get it onto the golf ball well yeah so now you just did that with your body so that's an extension pattern which is what we see again that's a lot of players do yep or just suck them up into you right seen that which feels horrible that hits like that doesn't work it just feels horrible right all of those what you just showed feel horrible yeah yeah they just do yeah um and and the reason like instead of me just saying that they feel horrible the reason that they feel horrible is we start with this General like if I have any sense of grip in the golf club hands Arm System I I've I've created a structure here and like any kind of hitting pattern if I were going to hit you don't worry I won't if I'm going to hit you hard I'm going to keep and maintain that structure so from right here I just pretty much abducted this left arm and add ducted the right arm so if I wanted to put pressure on you I could put a ton of pressure on you there got it as soon as I go into extension I lose that ability to just turn that abduct and adduct and now this whole structure gets whacked out so I lose control of like what's going on down here so so when you hit one of those shots that feels like really compressed for instance right yeah that's when it feels like you're almost like connected like the arms feel like they're connected to the to the rib cage right in a way yeah and and there's a lot of ways like that's a super interesting way to say that because we hear that a lot but again this word connected is like how do I what is connected to me how do you define it okay yep understand connected I think what you're you're saying again is that the structure of the arms like from right here if I did this right I could take the arms and this is like from right here I could go abduction which is that action this is adduction boom and I didn't change the shape of my arms hands and club that might unload a little bit that's bang yep okay got it right so I feel like oh this is nice and solid like this is connected or structurally sound like however you want to say it yeah it feels good and the reason it feels good is it feels like you have control over this yes right like some leverage over the golf clubs exactly and good players are probably going to feel that with their hands okay and we feel that feels bad because now I lose control of what the face is doing and that's because I'll probably be going into extension either in my spine my pelvis all all of it and now I can't turn anymore and that's typically because of a space issue I've got to create space late so the arms can go ahead and shoot ah so that's where that comes in so if I'm getting this thing close yep then I'm eventually going to have to stand up extend and add this throw action exactly or you could turn it away so go back to where you were yeah there you go so go into that delivery where you feel like you get close again good now if you took this whole lead shoulder and sternum and felt like it's turning on a curve on this angle that way like up back and away from you okay just set this behind the golf ball what are you there you got all the room in the world to get that back down there that's why we like chest rotation ah because it curves the sternum away and it gives you the space needed here for the arms and the golf club to shoot their energy out got it so as the sternum is now moving Up and Away yep now the golf club has permission to go ahead and shoot out exactly it can shoot out on its curve what creates the Curve that chest rotation so you'll feel out with the arms and club right out well that's not a curve but it will curve if you're turning if you're turning but if you finish it here there you go that's why we see the golf club like the the face will turn over and the and the unload will be up yep because you're just extension whether it's in the hips or in the spine or all of it and you lose all that so you lose bottom out you lose face stability you lose everything and now you can't control the golf ball so now if we move the chest the way we just showed there those joints moving up and away now you can basically feel like you actually let the golf club go and release it fairly I mean I don't know what the word is but you should get it out get get the energy out which is where we started with distal the golf club's designed on top it goes under it goes out yeah out meaning release it yeah and good movers meaning they can still rotate their chest through the strike they get the energy out as early as they want okay okay yeah so last thing with proximal is how this pelvis pelvic system works the reason that we want the drop is so that I can turn this sternum away because there's two different ways to create the room needed I can either extend in the hips and now this goes away so this generally I feel like I can at least release it right if I drop and don't turn I can't do that and that doesn't feel good yes so the two different ways to get the sternum moving away is either to extend in the in the spine and if I keep extending the spine it's going to leak into my pelvis or I'm going to rotate the pelvis early which is Trail hip extension which leaks into oh now I've got space again and I can hit it but again we don't necessarily prefer that pattern because the bottom out gets wacky potentially and the face rotation is probably going to go up so we like this drop now I'm dropping so the sternum is doing what I told it not to it's getting closer right okay got it but now I can curve it away so I have the space all of a sudden got it so you can't stand and turn the only way you can curve it away is if you drop first right if you drop first okay and the more you drop the more you're able to curve it away yep exactly we get that comment a lot too is like if you drop that Bunch aren't you aren't you just gonna like run it into the ground well you can if you just fire the arms from here so that's an inappropriate match-up yes drop fire the arms such a common question common comment exactly so instead we want this this rib system again it's from the sternum and we like the sternum because that's where the humerus attaches and it's kind of a middle point to see this spacing for the arms right so it's like okay if I drop and now I just turn the sternum up back and away this way oh now I've got the room I'm fine and you can shoot the energy out all day and it's going to be an appropriate amount of like a way for the arms to release okay so if they drop they can't they can't stop that process of turning that's where they'll run into the ground exactly right but as long as they swim out on that Up and Away curve yep then you don't really run into that issue that's exactly right okay so we've talked about two of the three systems now talked about the club system we've talked about the body system then we got this in between system in essence we've talked about the distal system and the proximal system now we need to I don't know what that word is but the tweener the tweener between them together is that where we're going with us exactly so this is the arms because if you understand the arms and typically what's nice is if you understand the the club system like if it's up then the arms are probably gonna light in the backswing it's up then the arms are probably going to respond correctly if it goes under then chances are the arms will respond correctly but just a general rule of thumb again is like how the humerus sits into the shoulder socket how it swings freely is on a bit of an angle here so like if you see runners run they're running this way they don't run this way and they don't run this way right unless they're five years old like my two-year-old daughters okay so when they run it's here so how this this works like this is called shoulder flexion this is shoulder extension that's how the humerus swings really freely in its socket so if we're looking at the body as supporting the arms if the body doesn't turn in essence the chest isn't turning in the backswing the lead humerus would swing up and you'll notice how generally speaking it's working up from like a face on view in front of this Trail shoulder do that with a club because this freaks people out yep I know it's freaky that's the golf swing yeah yeah exactly without chest rotation without chest rotation okay so this would be backswing yeah a way swing this would be forward swing so if I do this here yeah people look at it it's like we're freaking crazy right I went and got a golf lesson today this is what I learned because this doesn't look anything like a golf swing right and again in the backswing the trail arm isn't in charge of lifting we can talk about the nuts and bolts of what the hands and arms all that stuff do later but this is not this video yeah left arm lifts right arm lifts back swing finish right arm if it's soft and the left arm lifts that's the back swing doesn't look like it though does it no it doesn't not yet exactly so you already alluded to it what am I missing chest rotation so if I rotate the chest oh all of a sudden that looks like a nice structure exactly and if I do that together so in essence the chest and this lead arm are working in harmony oh clubs on top yep now it can fall under yep right but from here if I stop turning the right arm would lift and there's the Finish oh chest rotation okay so let's arm action arm action you practice this you're teaching the arms how they swing if I went chest arms chest arms or just arms chest okay cool arms chest okay cool that's a super basic way for people to understand that's like if you can understand that you you're on your way right exactly like and that's the what do you call the tweener concept that's what we're talking we're talking about the tweeners the arms blending blending some distal to some proximal exactly okay and I think if you're going to understand like what we're looking for again for like all players that we coach is they understand the entire global system and you hear guys on tour talk about this and gals on tour talk about this where you know when they're hitting it really well someone goes what are you thinking about they don't really have a response I think the way to articulate it is they're feeling their system they feel the club the arms and the body and how they interact with one another in sequence and in Rhythm and they feel good yeah I mean the way I feel it is like it feels like all of the components are in harmony exactly so not there's not a single component that's working that you have to manipulate or like it just works for your system 100 and that's hard to describe to people but the way to earn that right like the reason that you TJ have the ability to do that is because you're a badass freaking swing of the club and you earn that right because you learned each individual piece of the system how the lead arm swings what the trail wrist does that's how that body works as like a 15 20 handicap who might be watching this for instance or even above right they're probably going to have some thoughts when they're training how to swing sure right it's not like all those thoughts are going to go away like you hear a tour player talk about it you're gonna have to think of some some technical Concepts at first right of course of course you have to if you're going to learn like if you're going to have an actual high quality golf swing you're just not birthed that right there's a difference between talent and skill Talent you're birthed with right like okay if I'm seven feet tall I might be able to dunk a little bit easier than somebody that's five five the five five guy can dunk though because they acquire the skills needed so you can train all of those things in which is beautiful so you can earn any level of golf swing you want because of understanding skill well the skill comes from hopefully what we're providing folks is a better deeper understanding or knowledge base that then they're able to work with so they can develop the skills easier right so that's generally again the golf swing distal proximal tweener can you show that exercise one more time to like cap this off absolutely which exercise you're alluding to arm swing arm swing sure how they can kind of rotate the chest so again what's the Rotator the pelvis or the chest chest chest is the Rotator the pelvic system is the dropper again different topic but this is the Rotator folks the arms lift so in essence we've got a ferris wheel vertical plane okay got it paired along with a merry-go-round horizontal plane okay so if I can get both of them working together Ferris wheel merry-go-round and do them together I generally speaking I'm going to have a fairly neutral backswing and forward swing and you could pair both of them you could feel like I'm a right-handed player obviously so if I felt more like I'm hitting a left-handed shot here I could feel right arm swings up so there's the ferris wheel along with the Merry-Go-Round well that right there is through the strike if I just kept turning the chest to make me pivot yeah and then folded the arms oh they're mirror images of each other they're generally speaking Miriam that's a very good way to look at especially for somebody that's newer to the game or looking to like better understand their their system their golf swing got it yep so I think that's a pretty good way to just take a look at like just global perspective of gosling you got three systems you got the club the arm and hand system and the body system and there's three different phases in the golf swing as well there's the backswing transition phase and through impact or the out the release phase if you understand just what each system is supposed to be doing within those phases you're going to have a pretty darn good opportunity to improve your gossip word I think that's great word questions write them out we'd love to comment it also gives us great opportunities to better understand where the holes and our explanations are so that we can fill those gaps with good knowledge and give you a better understanding of just general golf swing how to improve your game yes sir

      "if you're not gripping it well immediately the arms hands and Club system cannot swing efficiently and no matter how good of moves you make in here right these things are going to manipulate in some way which is super frustrating because you could be working your butt off on really really good movement not hit good shots feel gross down here and you screwed it up before you even started moving [Music] Butch Harmon said it really well he was asked where do you start with a new player and he goes I always start with the grip okay so let's start with the grip as well let's do it we've got to look at both the hand and The Arm System so again hand system from the elbow down to the to the fingertips okay Arm System from the elbow up into the shoulder got it okay so what's interesting if we just stand here teach and face the camera if I'm just standing in a neutral state to see how like both my Palms face my thighs yes okay so they're not facing behind me they're not facing away from me that's neutral okay so this point right here the opposite the opposite side of your elbow is called your anacubital fossa okay okay that's the technical term good and where that is pointed right now is somewhat on this angle here so we'll just call it roughly 45 degrees now some folks stand this way a little bit more sure some folks down that way a little bit more but in general they're always going to face whoop this way so we'll have both anticubital fossa intersecting here okay got it okay so that would be one that's kind of a look at both the arm and the Hand system because that's a transitionary Point got it in our system okay what we also have uh your wrist is is ultra complex but if you feel around your wrist where I'm pointing right now or poking around right now there's kind of a knob there like a little bone right there yep exactly that is the head of your ulnar okay okay and then the radius the head of your radius you'll feel right there okay okay and again if I somehow was able to just go right through that plane we've got that intersection as well got it which is awesome because in general that points about the same direction that the antecubital fossa points got it so just a general rule of thumb a lot of people get themselves whacked out because they'll either supinate or pronate this hand system or externally rotate the humerus or too much internal rotation of the humerus okay okay most of the time what we'll see is this interesting combo of external rotation of the humerus and then pronation here see that all the time so we just whacked out the whole like arm line there so now your anacubital fossa is pointing like roughly here yep and then we get this bone pointed all the way over here exactly that's a great visual right there actually okay so it just kind of whacked out the whole arm line and how we just naturally how we naturally stand yeah exactly okay how this whole system just hangs got it so that's a good place to look at now when you grip it what we would like and we hear about this V that's created I like more a line like the term line I think would be better than V because that's a v there's separation here once I squeeze here I've created a line so this this line right here is what you're talking about right exactly right in between it's right in this meaty portion of uh the spot between the thumb and the pointer finger okay okay that meaty portion we're just squeezing there got it okay and then if I wrapped around this is this is it really important here where I'm I'm wrapping so we've got one two three digits in each finger yeah okay when you're wrapping it should come from the last digit starting the wrap and then leaks into the second one it's never from this joint here okay so from from this like knuckle right here never from there it's never from here so we're not going that way with it yeah that doesn't make a lot of sense exactly and it doesn't make sense because what we need is this squeeze and then this wrap so that the club sits between the middle digit of the forefinger okay and the thumb like the the pad of the thumb so when I squeeze there now that's what's creating pressure onto the grip got it okay so now when you look at that V or better line that we're creating we're creating this line that points more over towards your Trail clavicle or Trail shoulder right here okay okay that's beautiful and what we've kept is the same arrangement of each head of the ulnar and the radius so it's on that angle still like it where that antecubital is pointing there you go so now we have neutral ish okay okay and again everybody's a little bit different with this some guys just stand a little bit more internally rotated because they have a little bit more flexion in the shoulders when they stand fair enough other guy's a little more broad here some more broad I go the more external I go so that would be the grip but maybe the general idea is however you naturally stand is somewhat how you might want to grip the golf club right beautiful way of looking at that exactly and so if we just did that without a club here just generally in golf posture let the arms hang then we would squeeze okay and then from the last digit for bunk that's where we would squeeze see how I'm creating more or less a mirror image in both hands exactly so we would start with that left okay it would squeeze between the thumb and pointer finger last three phalanges lap on okay okay and for most a little bit of pressure from this this pinky into the Palm is good so that just holds that club in it just holds it in place yes so we're not letting it like flop around in there it's like burnt okay got it yep and then we do the same thing here so squeeze wrap that that four finger around and then from the thumb and the middle digit there we're squeezing to apply pressure okay last three fingers lap around I don't care if somebody ten fingers it okay truly I don't care if somebody interlocks I don't care if somebody overlaps generally speaking folks that have shorter fingers smaller hands interlocking is going to be better for longer fingers overlap is going to be better got it okay and for really anybody especially folks that need more speed 10 finger would be great okay so for smaller stature especially like kids a lot of Young Junior golfers right that's why we don't teach them to not grip it that way exactly exactly it's just generally going okay this is how the hands get on there okay so even if a junior golfer who's six comes in has a split group that's awesome because man they can create a lot of Leverage that way just shoot all the energy out of the screen fair enough okay um now this is something you know I've seen a lot and this is something I feel in my own grip this thumb right here and how it fits in good to the trail hand right um I mean how would you describe that I guess it's like it's going into like a valley here so that Valley is your lifeline okay okay so what's nice what you just described if if I go this way okay because that's generally speaking neutral standing posture can I just lift my arms up and put that right hand or Trail hand okay if you're a left-handed golfer it'd be the other way but for us righties that Lifeline just sits right where that that thumb would be sitting so it runs like directly up that Lifeline just goes right in there right through there so it just sit right in there so when this this hand wraps around the more that it wraps around what you're doing is squeezing the like meaty thumb pad and the meaty pinky pad together and you create that Valley like you described okay and that's right where the thumb would sit it's almost like a little puzzle piece that sits in there yes that's what it feels like is it they just fit together nicely when you make that that shape there okay exactly and the reason that that fits nicely for you is you have a very neutral grip okay folks that have a neutral left hand or lead hand yep and a stronger Trail hand they don't have that opportunity to have that sit in there so it's like where does this kind of sit right it just doesn't sit in there so you'll see that often we see both thumbs my favorite grips you don't see that and you tell me if this is like myth or real but when I when I put this on it feels almost like it connects the two hands together to whether now they operate relatively in sync with one another it's always nice to have like a little puzzle piece that just fits in there nicely I think you probably feel really comfortable with that because you've gripped it so many times it's like that's good yeah right but you train the heck out of that to have a quality grip yep okay the other really important thing about grip is the reason that we the reason that we need more of a neutral grip within the system and again there's wiggle room there's playroom for obvious different reasons I mean you see like Fleetwood has a little bit more of a cup up at the top of his swing right where more Cowa John ROM DJ they've got more of a flex lead wrist okay generally speaking you're going to have a weaker lead hand so when you Flex the lead rest of the top that generally you'll see if they're gripping it that hand is a little bit weaker exactly yes exactly exactly generally speaking not always but generally okay and guys that have a little bit more extension at the top of their swing so like Fleetwood for instance Fleetwood yep would have a stronger lead hand exactly stronger exactly and then Adam Scott has a little bit of a stronger lead hand however at the same time why is that why why is there the difference in how they grip it and like what is what is occurring there you know I think sometimes what happens is good athletes like as you progress through the game and you become more and more Advanced everybody has little quirks that they just latch onto and so you just naturally start without even having coaching fall into like matchups and you figure something out that just works really well and feels really well you hit enough golf balls you're going to figure some stuff out for sure it's interesting because I was watching a video I think it was a Tailor-Made video with DJ and more cow and they had him in this video together because they both bow and murakala is looking at DJ and he's like I think people think that we were taught that nobody ever told me to do that and if somebody told me to bow my left hand I don't even know if I could right but it's something he just does yeah he just does it's just a quirk okay which again is is awesome quirks are great everybody needs them because you feel things better that way you just know your own golf swing that's my theory on like that little match up but again in general like looking at Adam Scott dual internal more so like you look at his setup yep especially especially down in the hand system more dual pronated yeah so he's got a stronger lead hand but he's got a really nice weaker Trail hand so that's kind of a pairing that you would see with an Adam Scott right see that beautiful shape there's extension and that's one of our favorite pairings right is is Morse more or less right a stronger lead and a weaker Trail exactly and for the most part for general population that's a good one because now what they'll they'll tend to do to like Leverage The Golf Club is just Rd it all day if you like you talk about Rd like that's kind of the natural way they'll leverage the golf club from this strong lead week Trail and if you like go back and watch one of our previous videos on face stability Rd is one of the main ways that you create that stability right exactly and it's a really easy way to get energy out of the system yeah it's like a hammer right yep exactly exactly and that pairs really well with some extension okay so like to hit a little further that's a good way to to match that up sure okay this is a really important Point too in that okay we've got our hands on the grip but then how the center of mass of the club is interacting with that is super important so the center of mass of the club is just a balance point okay so you just hold your Club out like that and just balance it out generally speaking right got it perfect that's the center of mass okay okay from a face on perspective the center of mass and it's easier sometimes to just look at like the shaft angle sure the shaft should still be pointed from a face on perspective inside the lead elbow okay so in here somewhere yep somewhere in there to the to the center of mass of my body so the the general area to set this golf club up so like if I set up right here see how this the center of mass of the club is pointing right up towards my navel sure that would be fine okay or I could have it underneath that lead arm just a little bit more so now this the the shaft of the golf club is running up this lead arm okay and the reason being we're setting that system up in a good spot to be able to now deliver the golf club and hit the golf ball and if you look at every really Elite ball striker in general the center of mass shaft and and the lead elbow all line up at impact so that look there exactly exactly so this sheet plane whatever you want to call it balance is balanced out accordingly so you definitely won't see guys this way yeah that's an imbalance yep okay and you hardly ever see that because you're just dragging on the club and just generally speaking it doesn't feel like you have anything in that sure okay and you won't see high level players that way where the the center of mass and shaft run underneath the trail so you so in general right you can think of like a little box here you got Center of mass of your body and and just inside your lead arm as long as the butt end of the club is pointing somewhere in this region yeah you're good that's pretty good and the reason being is because that impact we try to create kind of those same conditions right generally speaking Yeah the arm system is is especially the lead arm and shaft okay that system should again generally speaking be replaced yeah okay and that's a good way to think of like the the lead Arms job in swinging the golf club it's sole responsibility or main responsibility is precision okay because I start with the shaft and the lead arm on one plane sure the Leading Edge would be on that plane as well yep see how the Leading Edge is it looks like a couple of degrees open yeah it's not because it's working down this particular plane here if I was to go here then the face actually looks square at that point there you go right so that that's just by leaning this forward a little bit that looks open but it's still creating that same line that you're talking about right this little system it's Square to the point got it exactly exactly so that's an important one to look at but again from a swing perspective if I'm swinging this up okay and then I'm swinging it back down which is how the arm system works in the golf swing that's its job now again that doesn't look anything like golf swing no okay so go ahead and set up here just with the lead arm okay just swing it up no body rotation good now if you just turn the body and keep that system the same that all of a sudden looks like a golf swing yep replacing of it boom we want that whole system to be retained right so so here's setup we're going to do that same exercise yep pick it up turn and then when I replace I want to relatively yep maintain that system we kind of Set It address exactly exactly the right arm's job is to create some leverage okay okay so if you look down the line teach if you go ahead and set up for us okay swing it back to the top and then replace it back to where impact would be boom you'll notice what TJ does really well here is the center of mass of the club through the hands through this Trail elbow is now all on one plane as well oh so if you're going to put pressure against my hands here you feel what's putting pressure on there that's that's the right hand exactly so this extension look through this is a support to go ahead and create leverage onto the golf club got it and so that's that's what creates the feeling at impact especially for high level players they'll feel this what this whole system is doing is like how much pressure I'm going to put into it okay especially for like little chips you can feel it in most folks feel it in their Trail hand they'll talk about the hand being like what feels like they put the pressure on it compared to the lead lead hand and lead arm they'll feel it in here okay why interesting is is it feels like okay well here's the leverage point that I can put leverage onto the golf ball either a lot and shoot the energy out of the system yep or I can just turn and kind of chip it there right or put a little bit of Leverage into it you can just play with shop making about how far you know so here's like a lot of Leverage right and then you could turn with that system and and at a very low rate of energy and you would just be relatively maintaining that leverage through the strike exactly right and then if you turn the system with a bunch of energy you just let that lever go essentially right exactly and like that with the shallowing move too if we go back to this some of the challenge we talk a lot about the the ribs but in that transition period this lead arm going internal pairs with the ribs but notice how like think of this as like Orion's belt the elbow my hands and the center of mass okay okay so Orion's belt's all in line there yeah now I got it out of line imbalance see how this I just broke the star system so why did you break the star system what'd you do all in the wrist structure okay see how the elbow's not doing anything so that's a really common one I see people try to do when they're trying to shallow is they just go boom yep and now the Orion's Belt is broken as you just talked about right exactly okay exactly so if we're back up to the top I can replace the system because Orion's Belt stays in in harmony so now I have these three points yeah still in line just like they were here yep okay well most of that's done in the ribs like if I just do it in the ribs how that leaks to some internal rotation the lead arm there you go and that will also help the trail elbow lower yep so now as I turn we'll see that shape so now I have this leverage point of again another Orion's Belt elbow hand Center of Mass to create leverage yeah well I'm still going bump Orion's Belt here yeah all in line so that's interesting like we talked about like the lead arm and how we want to kind of replace right that system now you talk about another Orion belt here in the trail arm what are some common ways that people like mess that up well starts with grip okay starts with grip so if they grip it you know strong underneath I see that one a lot exactly because what what you're doing if we go back into these fascial lines is your your rotating those lines yep so if you take a towel that's wet and you wring it out and then just let it go where does it wants to go the other way so if I've gripped it that way right and now I'm going into impact these forces are crazy loaded and so now as I rotate bang yeah now I got crazy face face rotation that's why we we generally speak and actually not generally speaking always dislike a strong right hand so to kind of maintain these orions belts as you're talking about like the main thing is is grip like you got to make sure it's it's in there appropriately and then that that helps tremendously what you're going to do later on exactly that's why grip is important because it is a match-up got it based on Corks And we have and then also just the leverage points balance points of the whole system of the arms hands and club like that is The Swinging system again we talk about body all the time but at the end of the day we talk about body so much because it's there to support The Swinging actually the arms hands and club like that's really important to get your head around totally so if you're not gripping it well immediately the arms hands and Club system cannot swing efficiently and no matter how good of moves you make in here right these things are going to manipulate in some way which is super frustrating because you could be working your butt off on really really good movement not hit good shots feel gross down here and you screwed it up before you even started moving yeah yeah exactly grip is one of those things as soon as you change somebody's grip they're like whoa what's going on because they lose the feeling of where the golf club is because it's different in here sure and how the hands get on there directly influences where the face is which we got to know where the racket is at impact if we're going to hit it where we're looking definitely but this is the most unathletic part of golf swing you don't have to be any ounce of a golf of an athlete to hold it well and we see that reflected I mean like tons of students that we teach right away like as long as they're deliberate and focused about that process see a lot of them in here on this line just like beautiful grips over and over and over again it takes no level of athletic ability zero athleticism whatsoever to grip the golf club right and if you grip the golf club well that already like there's so many good things that happen as a result of that yeah because again what we want is is the athlete then to figure out the match-ups sometimes unconsciously so I think part of being a good coach sometimes is hopefully teaching one important foundation that then leaks into 15 other principles that you never even have to talk about sure because now the the player feels better but it's really important to at least start with the arms hands and Club balanced out generally well and sometimes it takes 10 shots to feel like oh now I feel kind of good and sometimes it takes 30 days yes I mean there's one one kid that we work with that means not a kid anymore but he plays professional golf and he was indicating to me that it took him about five years for the grip for that to feel comfortable that is a really important thing you just brought up because oftentimes when I when I make a grip change to a student it's like two balls in and they're ready to like dish it because like you said it now the club feels completely different in your hands right so understand that what you're working with is going to help you and just be patient right exactly exactly exactly and as long as we can say the be patient part as much as we want but there needs to be a correlation to like I'm doing this because of X Y and Z right when I do these things along with this it's going to make the whole system better so now I can afford to be patient from like a cognitive you have a reason to be patient we're humans we're smart we think so if somebody tells us to do this and it doesn't make sense to the rest of the whole system yeah I'm going to Dish it immediately because I'm going to go back to what I know at least so I think that's on everybody which is is a really important Point as well cool so okay there's grip Orion's Belt grip arms man yeah we went through a lot of stuff here but that's great that was grip that's a great start and we'll just keep dishing out um more and more setup principles that go along with the systems that we really like to see yes sir um we love making these videos guys so please continue to comment um we love answering questions as well I mean the reason that we did this video in the first place is because of the comments that we're receiving from you again if you have any questions reach out thanks again peace peace [Music] thank you\n",
      "you want to let the arms and your body fall on this side for longer so it's not rotated to throw it out so early so that was like you fall longer there yep and I'm going there there you go the turn is to sling the arms out got it you just fall up there fall awesome then we're flushed out [Music] we're talking about load phase dog this is kind of a cool way to think about golf swinging I think you earned this right eventually but we have anything about the old golf swing is a load phase and an unload phase okay like super simply yeah if you know the P system like p1p2 okay um easy way to think about that as well is P1 is a dress P4 is top of golf swing pop a backswing and then the other phases are just levels different levels so either Club level P2 P3 lead arm level to the ground okay got it then we get up here to P4 so P5 would be from P4 going back down to level with this lead arm okay that's the finish of the load phase yeah okay so that's a very important distinction right most people would go load phase unload so that's like backswing downswing right load unload right but that's not it not our preferred pattern okay you can do that but we we like to load for longer okay and by the way understanding what we're meaning by load phase is really important too like obviously the club needs to be loaded so we are bowing it there's some torque um you're loading up arm lines okay and you're loading up the lead side upper spiral line loading a spiral line is super similar to the boat drill which you've done that that video before but if I'm going to load this lead side upper spiral okay I'm taking this upper spiral and I'm just pulling on it got it so just knocks the air out of you right it's like compresses your diaphragm the whole thing sure so that's loaded a loaded fascia line is just one that's stretched okay so this line that you just showed right across here is stretching yep exactly exactly so I'm sure what you could do is just put up the fascial line sure of the Spiral it's that nice blue line looks like a rubber band and we're just pulling that rubber band from right up in here under that scap and across here up back and away that's a loaded spiral okay so at P5 we're here so you can see this is pulled up back and away you can see how this Gap is depressed this is all like these ribs are separated you see this nice Bend in the thoracic so you can see how this spiral going this way is pulling you up back and away so that's one okay and we also want the lead posterior arm line okay to be loaded okay so one of the easiest ways to do that is adduct okay there you go so we're adducting this lead arm and you can feel from right here this whole line that whole fascial line is stretched and the anterior Trail arm work is stretched so that's just going this way yep yep so that's a ton of adduction some scaps and blah blah blah okay okay but in essence if I do that you'll feel this load stretch if I do this you'll feel this load and stretch yep that's the fully loaded face the upper spiral line anterior Trail arm posterior lead arm okay and the club all loaded up got it so how do we get there this is a really great drill so if you have a medicine ball especially this one's nice or a kettlebell would be good yeah so if you're holding it here and I want to move the ball well I could move it in a couple of different ways I could do this which is let's just eye test this does this look better or does this look better yeah I'm gonna go with the second one exactly most people would agree like second one looks a little bit better yep okay well what we're seeing again from the eye test is like oh that athletically looks better okay and what we're doing when we're doing this properly let's just focus on the posterior lead arm line as soon as I move my center of mass and my ribs away from the Target and I leave the arms and the ball behind I do not load this okay so that that lead arm Line's not loaded yet the backswing the whole time in the backswing I'm not loading the the posterior interesting which I mean maybe we're jumping ahead here but one of the main things that we see as a fault right is immediate load is a lead arm so once you add duct you've loaded the posterior lead arm weight it's all stretched yep right the problem with that is if we kept doing that all the way up to the top to the top one the club could get way deep and number two in transition from P4 to P5 it's wanting to unload yeah totally exactly which is a problem because now we're getting all the unload here there ain't no ball back here man it's down here still yeah so what do you got from here you just like push and do all kinds of stuff and juice it yeah yeah I got it it's just this extra like late blast that just feels gross super un like inefficient Okay so no good to move the ball with adduction early yep okay way better to move the ribs so how this would work so if I've got this Trail side upper spiral line yep I want that activation to toss the arms up for most folks okay now again you can overdo it because this doesn't look all that good either no it doesn't right so there is some amount of arm fire but for most people because they arm fire too much in excess and early it's going to feel way better for them to sling their arms up here because of the Spiral because of the ribs and how this works again so we'll go lateral movement so there's the rib Sway in the rib see I just can leave my arms and hands and Club behind here and then now as I go upper upper upper spiral upper spiral upper spiral oh look at that yeah I almost look fully turned and my arms are still down here yeah so maybe you could like face down the line here because that's a really interesting look what I just saw there so go ahead and show me that those spiral lines starting to swing so we got rib sway upperspire upper spiral upper spiral upper spiral upper spiral good and like to you this is like pretty dang relaxed right here right and it's like yeah it's just limp noodle right exactly so at what point does that actually get stretched well that's super important to know okay right so this is why it's so so so important to look at the golf swing as Dynamic and not static so drills where folks will go up to the top and hold the reason that I can hold it up here is because that's an activated like muscle that's muscle activation fascial activation yeah so now I can hold it up here when in actuality what we would like to see is sure it would kind of just super soft yeah exactly exactly so what we want is enough energy in this Trail upper spiral line sure to sling or toss the arms up got it and as they're going up I could fall and start to turn the other way got it so there's two different ways to to add duct I can either add duck because of the arm actually adducting so this the the active mover here is the humerus okay right the humerus bone is moving now I loaded that up or I can start turning the rib system into it and now I've adducted gotcha so that was nothing you did by actually moving the arm this way but if you move your ribs into that system now this all loads up exactly so this all will work this way so go back to neutral they're set up okay so if you go rib sway and there's the up there's the upper spiral and they'll start to Upper spirals upper spiral upper spiral upper spiral and in actuality the arms would be about right here if you did that with enough energy you'd toss the arms up like your arms would keep working up yeah that act alone initiates a little bit of that posterior lead arm line but as I'm doing this I got your arm you're gonna drop and start to rotate the ribs the other way now it's loaded yep now it's fully loaded now what does it want to do now I can unload it at the proper time so that's such a good feeling when that happens exactly exactly so we have a no no load in in backswing here yep then in the transition phase so this is this is a good look too so from P1 to about P 2.5 ish somewhere between like P2 and P3 okay that's the finish of the backswing okay okay say that again yeah right so I'm done yeah I'm done now if I put enough energy in this upper spiral it slings up to the top yeah it's it's just not actively being boom boom boom boom yep yep so we're not just pushing this up here to get to the to get to the top yeah right like now I've loaded this yeah no dice okay so we have to have the the transition is from like P 2.5 to P5 which is that's the transition phase right compared to how most people view transition right and that's why like when we're when we're loading this up we've got swing I'm active it goes swing slow stop yeah what swing slow stop that's the backswing whoo we just started the transition which again that kind of leads back to what you were saying before like when people do these like freezer drills for instance right what you're showing there is like is like this club's like falling on you that's how it should kind of feel at the top yep and when people do freezer drills it's like push activate now I'm gonna try to hit it from here I want width yeah well you're training a quick unload yeah because it's loaded yeah because you can't can't keep that right well you could you could but it's going to feel gross yeah that's like nobody's gonna do that everybody's going to want to hit sure well the reason that we hit is we've loaded up a fascia line sure like if I'm gonna smoke you I'm going whoa anterior yeah Trail arm I could smoke you right now yeah boom right yeah okay well if I did this see how like in this in this phase anterior line isn't loaded so I would have to step keep this going away now it's loaded now I can fire so we want the load phase to be at the the appropriate time so the unload phase can be at the appropriate time so the fully loaded all of those lines loaded are much later than most people would generally do that and much calmer you're not trying to load it's a passive load sure all you do is fall and turn to load there you go so now we've got upper spiral posterior lead arm line anterior Trail Online that's hard as a rock right there so now if you just fire everything just goes you can just wash all the energy out of the system but before then before that hard as a rock everything's chill and chill and it builds it builds it's wave-like yeah calm it starts to Crest and then it can wash out yeah right so we've got no load phase when it comes to this lead arm line that's the finish of the backswing got it this is the start of transition because it would still be going up I would be dropping and starting to turn the other way okay so that's transition now I'm fully loaded so now I can go into the unload phase okay no load load unload huh yeah that's the sequence that's the sequence okay yep so that's the the load is really important because what we're constantly looking to do is feel better and better through the unload phase well if you don't work the load phase appropriately yeah it's harder down it's going to be difficult down at the end it's harder through here exactly and when guys are hitting it really well consistently really well they feel tremendous from P5 to like P9 the finish of their golf swing and that's hole unloads like easy and a lot of that tremendous feeling that you're talking about happens just because this load phase was so nice right now from here like it's pretty simple to unload the golf club right it's just turn the chest yep let the club out yep exactly so that makes it so much easier and and guys explain it in such funny ways uh you know I hit it really well today because my rhythm was good what the heck does that mean what is rhythm right my I felt good with my tempo I covered it like everybody's just trying to say something that just encapsulates like the whole thing the reason that happens is because they are loading and unloading their system at the proper times appropriately and in nice Rhythm it's wave-like it's not bolts yeah boom it loads and washes out yeah depending on how far you want to hit it right so that like wave like Rhythm that's like such a fundamental like Testament to what we're talking about here right absolutely and fascia and muscle activation likes to work in waves not in pulses it's a very safe way to operate got it and super efficient because it won't feel like you're working that hard okay you can blessed it so what's maybe an exercise that we could do with a golf club right and again talking novice intermediate to teach them how to load this up I would start without a golf club start without a golf so something that has a lot of weight or mass to it 20 pounds or so yeah but we want to move this like if not if this is super heavy like if I'm holding like a big old TV right here the last thing I'm going to do is move it with my arms no you're going to have to move with your whole body right exactly exactly so to get this swinging yep I need to start moving the center of mass and see how another of mass being in here Center mass of my ribs so I got Center Mass over here and then here come the arms then the center Mass goes over here there goes the arms if I just tossed a little like upper spiral with this in the backswing we would toss it up here even got yourself a bag okay well but if you watch the rhythm of it swing slow stop yep so now if I wanted to Huck it the other way I could drop and toss it out here so that's that's again that's how that loading that fully load happens you got swing slow stop drop yep and turn and as that's happening now you get to unload zip it out the other way yeah you can toss anything out that way you want right even if it's really massive you can still Huck it but you're never going to Huck it this way no but you get a lot tighter right Golf Club in your hand and it's easy to do that so training with that heavy thing in your hand exactly forces you to do some of these things right exactly and then what you can do is just kind of play around with some extension in the trail wrist to load up the club head okay so because again this doesn't look quite right now it looks more floppy it's floppy and you don't know where the golf club is okay so as you start to go here sound like sending the arms like this way my ribs are going the opposite way won't then I could feel all right what if I just went boom boom so I'm still ribs then extension the trail wrist and you're just loading up that trail right arms there goes there go my ribs and then there goes the trail rest exactly now you'll feel the whole system like work yep and if you put enough energy in it it'll float up there there you go as it's floating you drop and start to turn out the other way there it is look how long you chill yeah so if you hit a ball like that teach okay same deal same deal same exercise as the ball is just see how long you can float up there yeah because this is in the process of loading this meaning the posterior Elite armlet in the process of now it's loaded I feel like I can go so almost the longer you wait the more it can load right decent way looking at it the more that the ribs can separate away from that lead arm line now it can't load it it's it's well it's unloaded it can load but it's unloaded right now so it can't fire if a fashion line is unloaded it can't fire or it feels gross too sure right so now I got it now I've got to like wait for it to load now I can fire whoo there you go it says you're falling and going the other way oh now it's adducted it's loaded you can fire so let's show on that like almost looks absurdly long in transition we'll see what that looks like let's get crazier with the separation between the ribs and the lead arm oh shank that was awesome that was awesome now do that again yeah but all that is is you want to let the arms and your body fall on this side for longer so it's not rotated to throw it out so early so that was like fall longer there yep and I'm going there there you go the turn is to sling the arms out got it you just fall up there fall awesome now we're flushed out so now it's not pitching over the plate cool yeah super good yeah okay now last one to kind of wrap it up here okay show one with early abduction okay to swing the golf club back so you're not doing it with your ribs you're doing with this lead arm and just hit one just a normal one but just like early ad deck like right off the bat that looks a heck of a lot different yeah and it feels world's different too yeah it does yep okay so again going to this load phase understanding our three phases we got backswing face which again is from like P1 to P 2.5 P3 at the very latest got it transition phase from about P 2.5 all the way to P5 as transition so you've got all this time where it's floating to organize everything into delivery or P5 and now we've got the unload face got it there'd be no load backswing load transition unload through impact and then to finish so those are the three phases load unload that's the golf swing okay and it unloads what we're looking for yeah is way less complex than the load or the the backswing and and the transition the whole load phase so that's why we spend so much time spent spent there yeah so that when you're organized here you can just fire and go yeah and not even really think through the strike it just makes it so much easier way easier yeah so load correctly makes a whole golf swing easier for you absolutely foreign\n",
      "focus on the trail heel got it and from P5 all the way to P9 which is the Finish you're going to let the heel the trail heel spin away exactly yep excellent and this is really cool stay right there for us his toes look this way right now yes he landed you're Landing almost feeling like the pressure of the pinky toe yeah right so I'm sure it's more that way right and that's the go-to pattern right yes exactly foreign [Music] we got leg and foot action today which is actually a pretty fun one to be honest is something that we don't really talk a lot about but it's kind of fun because it is talked about in uh in coaching but it also if you understand kind of what your feet and what your legs should be doing it can help really facilitate what the pelvis should be doing and I think there's some really common misconceptions about what the legs and the feet are doing in the golf swing okay and so we have these like really bad Maps really bad pictures of what our legs should do and it just totally screws up any chance of like moving the pelvis well moving the ribs well it's just all blown out of proportion Hogan talked about from the feet up you did so let's go with the feet first a couple of drills out there we see this one actually go back to neutral if you could okay lift up your uh the out step right here in the ball of your foot okay okay from right there try not to put pressure on that ball in the backswing okay and then in the forward Swing Swing start to roll off of that so you roll on the InStep here this is my least favorite drill of all time as soon as you roll that way what happened to the trail hip went that direction exactly and we're gonna rotate at some point so what you just did with that movement is you move the pelvis laterally so there's a lateral slide okay see how that rolls onto the InStep yeah yep I've heard that before I've heard it called banking yep that look right there yep exactly um if we go to just basic human movement gota would barf everywhere this is why is that well because one of their key I don't know if it's a global principle but they want inside ankle bones high so we got ankle bone here that's the inside ankle bone and then we've got the the ankle bone here this is the outside ankle bone good human movement proper human movement when it comes to gutter to move forward and start to pressure off this back fret from my heel spun away and the inside ankle bone gets higher when I do that okay poor gait pattern would be this guy so as I'm starting to push forward they would spin this this femur external and then as they push now this inside ankle bone goes low when it comes to that trail foot that foot the heel should actually spin away okay and as we start to move our way up Hogan from the feet up I go to the top again for me just staying on this Trail side as you start to get into delivery okay from right there as you start to move forward now into impact let this Trail heal start to spin away and what there you go and now what will happen see how this knee this Trail knee stays underneath you so the shape of this femur is almost vertical but what it'll also allow you to do is this as this starts to work internal more and more look at where your sacrum's starting to go swiveling back behind me it keeps going that way okay exactly go back up to the top for us now go the the wrong way right so as you're Banking and starting to to working that there you go excellent see where this trail trail hip starts to go it starts to go laterally if you keep Banking and working to impact look at how the pelvis just keeps working into extension we've got dual hip extension coming this way yep doesn't feel good either it doesn't feel too good where'd you feel that a lot of pressure on like the low low back exactly exactly because what it does is it shoots as soon as our pelvis starts to shoot forward this way that's all extension in the lumbar okay and obviously we're going to rotate at the same time so we've got lumbar extension and rotation it's kind of a bad time horrible right you're just yeah you're creating all kinds of pressure back there and a lot of low back injuries in our game most of them are due to inflammation that is the pattern that creates inflammation in the low back not just repetitive extension lumbar extension paired with rotation yep injury riddled Central can I already feel it here like a little yeah you're like I like that yeah that's because you know how to move well sure right folks that just just go into like that is my pattern of like that that move right there is a pronation move in the foot like what should actually happen as a supination move supination is that way okay in the foot and what that makes the inside ankle bone do kicks the eyes it's high right the outside ankle bone is lower than the inside ankle bone is that's beautiful look and there's a ton of drills out there that quite frankly I just disagree with like you'll see a water bottle uh being put out here so if I if I spin that way then no good I would knock that over so it actually promotes that kind of a look it's a pretty poor exercise if you're looking to get more into like a flexion rotation type of pattern which is what we definitely prefer to see agreed yep so that's Trail foot stuff got into a little bit of the leg action we might come back into into the trail leg okay but let's go to the Lead Foot now okay okay so if we swing it back up to the top again okay what will eventually happen like TJ let's show long drive patterns so big upper spiral there you go so see right there what already happened is this heel spun towards the target which is exactly what happened over here in the trail foot complex but it's it's lighter yeah okay that trail heel spun towards the target that's just because the spiral line the upper spiral line leaks down into the into the lower spiral line which is all through TJ's IT band and if that keeps stretching stretching stretching what it does is it just pulls pulls pulls pulls pulls there you go so there's the heel going inside ankle bone low outside ankle bone High got it so when we see the pressure in a lot of our favorite movers go from P1 all the way to P5 big upper spiral now P5 so that will plant see how the heel actually planted closer to the Target than where it originally started agreed we see that in Rory McIlroy we see that in Cameron Champ we see that in like numerous great movers Okay so one of the drills that personally again I dislike is this drill you see like a basket in here or a med ball seen that many times okay so I'll be here they're both slick so if I swing to the top and then now I'm trying to drop that Med ball what I just did is dual external rotation of the femurs okay I mean my femur is rotating this way this finger is rotating that way so what it's promoting If this just kept going like far on an ice skating rink with that look it would promote that action there so the foot spins in that direction the foot is spinning in the opposite direction which is funny because from right here at the top like from P4 if I go basket drill it looks like it's what we want the sacrum to do which the sacrum goes that way but it's early sacral move away so that now from here as I go this way the only way to get forward is to extend the pelvis so now I'm going to have extension through the strikes of the sacrum is going towards the target so that's interesting um when when people hear our sacred moved sometimes I've seen this in some students attempting it on their first go-around is I see them try to do it like super early and see what just happened there so we have early supination now you can do that that's not bad it's not that you can't do that okay because you can still have in our system good movement patterns there as long as you can get the ribs way up here and typically what happens like when doing that is we're going to have the same type of Landing if you will it's difficult to see with like especially sometimes even long irons but like mid irons on down through wedges you won't see that because the spiral isn't stretching enough to really make this this heel flash like we're talking about yeah driver it's a bigger wave bigger range of motion a little bit so you see it more yeah exactly so you don't see Rory do that with nine iron but you see him do it with driver and that's just a due to how much energy they carry into that upper spiral right yep yep and if the energy keeps going wave-like then it's going to continue to move it's just like if I push somebody in a swing set if I push them with that much energy they're going to swing slow stop and then come back this way if I push them with that much energy they're going to swing slow stop so it's a bigger range of motion it's not like I just put energy in and then it stops up here understood that's wave-like so um again when it comes to that lead foot how it's planting all the way again from P1 to P5 go ahead and show this okay boom there's the the Lead Foot planting closer to the Target and the sacrum is that its furthest point towards the Target that it ever will be in the golf swing okay because now from here if we go up into into the pelvic region as TJ starts to rotate now the sacrum can really work away let's actually show that from posterior view so go ahead and face me and here we can actually see better with the heel so let's see huge upper spiral boom and plant there you go so there's all the way to P5 so this is the furthest this point will be in space now go from P5 to p7 which is impact boom and you'll see now that that sacrum really busted away okay that's the preferred pattern got it that's Victor hovland yeah right that's what we see him do as well it was great it looks beautifully so um the other thing that I think would be really good to talk about is this lead Famer and how it moves in the swing so go ahead and start at P1 okay and then go all the way to P3 for me good now if you just make the transition from P3 to P5 there you go this actually the femur stays internally rotated and now as you keep rotating more and more more more this is going to go more into internal rotation the femur itself yes okay which sounds ridiculous because if we just had like a point in space sticking out of the kneecap you'll see this point in space allow you to go this way more and more so you go well that's external rotation no okay why is that because it's relative to where our midline is pointed and we have like all these different like the midline we could think of it in in like the sternum and we could also also think of it like where the the belt buckle is pointed so this would be a good way to look at this so right now my kneecap is pointed on kind of that angle right there and everybody's is a little bit different right it's about right there okay and my belt buckle is pointing right towards the camera got it okay so as I move into it like Drop and start to work into P5 see where see where the belt buckles pointed see where this is pointed yep so now as I start to to drop and turn look at where the belt buckle points now yeah okay it's pointing straight towards the camera okay and the knee is almost pointed straight where it was at the address position got it now as I continue to rotate the pelvis now all of a sudden my my belt buckle is pointing thing over here it's past where that knee is initiate address it actually goes this way exactly so it's pointed here's this is really easy hip socket hip socket so perpendicular to that is here well where's your knee pointing good so it is internally rotated when thinking of the Medline the midline when it comes to the pelvis okay got it so the lead femur is continually working into internal rotation from P4 all the way to P9 which is finish and that creates a little bit of that stretch right it's just a load just a load yeah it's just part of the Spiral line okay okay so but again one of the like that that ball drill that I showed earlier this drops that's externally rotating sure that's not good human movement no right understood and there's part of golf swing that's not great human movement like the finished position is an extension position which is sure can be harder on certain joints but at the end of the day we're floating to that position right there's not a hard like muscle activation fascial activation lots of pressure there you're floating up to the top right so so just to be clear about this lead knee you will see it work this way yep just not actively working that way correct it is passively working that way okay and it works that way because the pelvis is rotation makes it eventually go so it's not something you want to try to do from the top independently of everything else not in our system it's going to happen as a result of how you're moving exactly the upper spot okay and the other thing that we see too when it comes to leg action is we hear this like ground reaction force people are pushing off the ground hear it often yes okay you can push off the ground okay and there's probably Pros out there that feel push off the ground but you don't have to push off the ground in order to go into leg extension okay okay so often like there's golf posture so I have some sort of flexion in the knees okay like this is more flexion this is less flexion so that's extension so I don't need to actively feel this okay through the strike through the strike okay okay you can but you don't have to because again that picture that map in your mind can be super detrimental because if I'm only thinking about extension I'm not really rotating in my mind at all now am I yeah yeah so the golf club is going to with that type of a pattern flash faster and that leaks into extension here and here and here everywhere it just goes through the entire map of the body so knee extension is going to leak into hip extension you're going to leak into into spine extension those are anti-rotation maps yeah that's a pattern I even got myself into in the past like yeah kind of an actively trying to push or jump off the Lead Foot and create on all that extension and the face flashes like crazy and the problem with this is like sometimes for a very short period of time it's like this piece of tape that I just like okay I held it together yeah and it worked for a short period of time and then that call to action doesn't work anymore it actually creates massive problems in the swing and I think that sometimes is the problem with us as coaches is we're we're giving every word every phrase that we say is a map yeah it's a map it's a map so this is why we like systems approaches because you can see why this moves again passively and you can go all the way to the chain of event of like what actively was like the map that made everything else move so if we can say something in one phrase move this way and it makes 17 things passively respond properly that'd be a pretty good map that's a much better map than you need to do this and this and this these are all active things cognitive things that I'm having to do that many things in your brain it is and then inevitably what happens is it goes clunk clunk clunk clunky positions positional right yeah yep yeah exactly so let's go back to this lead knee sure because it's really pretty cool so let's go from P1 to P3 good so no more flexion in it if anything you might have a little bit of extension in this leading so it honestly works this way exactly and the reason that that happens is if you go back to P1 we've got the ribs go laterally they Bend and turn so this upper spiral is pulling up back and away and it pulls on the lower spiral and that just feels like almost straight now like there's I've lost some of that bend but to do that you didn't go push off the ground no I didn't cause some other problems exactly so go to P3 again we'll finish the backswing excellent so now transition is going to be where the momentum of the golf club is going to keep going up and the ribs start to now work back here now we have more flexion in this lead knee than we started but that's because the rib system moved up here the sacrum is its fullest forward point so now if this spiral because you've got this spiral loaded now if it starts to pull up back and Away the Sacre moves away and look at what the leg responded like um extension yeah that there was Zero push off the ground no yeah so it just happened as a result of that spiral pulling back in this direction like it has to move that way exactly you can't maintain that exactly okay understood exactly so those are better maps and this is why we don't talk about leg action all that often because of the pelvis system moves well and the rib system moves well then the legs tend to follow the legs tend to follow correctly and the feet tend to follow correctly but if we have these unconscious maps of like this is what works here the whole system doesn't work together I know there's many people that have that unconscious map whether it's they saw the drill somewhere they saw a video and they've I've spent time doing the same drill myself where I was trying to Bank off that inner foot right I think everybody has at some point tried these things so it's nice to go back and kind of clean that map up and go okay maybe we don't actually need this 100 and for folks like watching this these little pieces of the road map will help facilitate the things that you're trying to do in your pelvis and your rib system okay so let's go like how to actually apply this like for actual swings okay got it okay so let's go ahead and hit a few here and the first one that I want you to do this is going to be a low rate of energy here okay but we're going to focus on the trail heel got it and from P5 all the way to P9 which is the Finish you're going to let the heel the trail heel spin away exactly yep so it's 60 percenter boom excellent and this is really cool stay right there for us notice how there is like his toes look this way right now yes he landed you're Landing almost feeling like the pressure of the pinky toe yeah right so I'm sure it's more that way right and that's the go to pattern right yes exactly so now we're nowhere heels away all day we're outside edge got it rather than Inside Edge so that's an easy way to go about that let's let's hit another one now and this one will actually be focused on P1 to P5 so the load phase okay and this is a big load but I want you to notice how the lead heel now lands so at the landing position of P5 the the lead heel is going to land closer to the Target then it started got it mostly because of the Spiral boom there you go and notice how TJ's showing like a little mock first to kind of get it activated like a good clear map in his mind excellent beautiful that's a beautiful way of doing that okay next one we can focus on the lead femur okay okay from um all the way under the fully loaded face so like as as you feel the Tre or the lead heel plant where is the the femur moving is it moving external or internal right there you want to try to feel internal internal yep because of that that's internal rotation of the femur okay and femur again what point is that for people who don't know yeah femur is this big bone right here this bone right here from knee to hip so we don't want to feel as we're planting here that the femur goes that way exactly and a lot of people will focus on the knee see the knee where it goes so you can focus on where that knee is continually pointed at P5 so it's pointing inward external right exactly exactly and now for for some folks because there's a lot of mobility issues that people have on their hips you might feel both there's a plant and now as you turn out of there you might feel this this is a supination action again supinate and rotate that way yep that's fine you see a lot of guys on tour do that land and then boom all the way up into the finish this spits out and rotates away that's okay yep others like you you've got loads of mobility and like sure this whole like it band spiral line glute Mead but I mean maybe this helps so it helps like when I first started trying this I did not see that same Mobility yep and I would see my heel Flash in this direction now that there's a little bit more Mobility I've been doing the pattern for a long time those things go away and that starts to happen yeah exactly and with big waves yeah you're probably gonna see some especially drivable for sure like you'll see guys like Patrick Patrick Reedy D weights the Lead Foot like driver it's in here and then when he hits it boom that comes off the ground because all this is working up back and away and that's fine because that's just the force being created right it's just a force exactly it's not like he's trying to push off of there again to make that happen it's just a responsive Force got it based on his pattern so anyway to get to get back to the exercise here femur as I go ahead and land in a P5 I want to feel like it works there you go and what's really cool teach yeah this is the exact look that you had was focused on the lead heel the first time sure what's great is it's the same map but a different way of explaining the map to yourself and every single person is going to have a little bit of different way of recognizing the system and feeling the system and visualizing it yeah so you could focus femur knee feet heels pressures yeah all that is fine as long as it's like again a response in the system exactly exactly totally okay so let's show one more with that uh that lead femur or lead knee it's kind of all one part of like the same type of system in the legs boom there you go so this is an internal feel all the way from P1 to P5 foreign okay last one let's go back to the trail side and we're going to focus on this lead knee and what I want you to focus on is one once we land a P5 as your as you're rotating all the way through the Striking to finish this knee doesn't get to go forward at all it's it's going to as I start to rotate in my ribs my pelvis the whole bit this knee is going to stay underneath underneath me here so the knees kissing if I drew kind of an imaginary line just off the midline yeah mid do you think that this knee would ever really cross that I would like to see it not so you'd like to see it more or less work yep exactly and look at what that heel did spun away okay exactly so so we're missing ain't a very good looking all right nope exactly that's that's knees kissing right that's banking like you were talking about yeah okay that's pronation of the foot got it all again in our eyes unhealthy patterns understood yep so on this one I'm going to feel my knee never cross that line even feel like it almost Works away from it yep exactly and most people it'll never cross that line like all the way to delivery some people will get to the top and then it immediately starts to cross we don't see that one because that's such an early extension look but a lot of people will get to delivery and then it starts to flow and again back through impact here you'll see that one a lot exactly and you'll feel it in your pelvis a ton and look at the spine angle and you'll feel it here like that lumbar pressure that you felt before so again that they only spinning leaks into pelvis keeps me more underneath dual hip flexion got it that keeps you in a flexion state for longer beautiful okay so this knee TJ's knee never passes his midline there you go beautiful stays Underneath Him beautiful and look at how that move looks super similar to the first move then that your Trail heel responded beautifully yeah yeah pretty sick and what's cool too now like if you're watching PGA Tour players because there are extension tilt patterns out there there are flexion rotation patterns watching what a person's feet do will help you provide the keys of like what's going on the pelvis what's going on their ribs I bet you can tell what Scotty Scheffler is now yeah okay sure no like disrespect to Scottish shuffler whatsoever in the world he's freaking great like unbelievable player you can just tell which end of the spectrum he's on compared to hobland yeah watch his foot action you'll see a totally different Foot Action there and you'll see where they kind of land again in like our spectrum of movement in our systems yeah so it's kind of fun exactly wagon feed action baby that was a good one that was a really good one thanks peace ask questions [Music]\n",
      "see so many guys on the Range like okay I got to get it inside here and they're just totally screwed because now I can't control the bottom it's always going to be an upward hit kind of so never compr yeah that's General stuck stuck means that the club's not behind you it means your hands are behind you oh okay hands are in front club Behind that's not stuck oh dude it's in front of me now hello I can control this boom [Music] what we talking about today dude all right this one's going to be fun I think again just general thoughts that folks have and what they're trying to do they they go about doing it in the wrong way so this is going to be a really really cool one because we're talking about the hands and their General swinging like their Arc throughout the entirety of the Swing compared to the club head or the center mass of the club so if we to get really really like technical MH you'll you'll hear this term called Hub path quite often which is the point go ahead and grip it sure the Hub point is the point right in the middle of TJ's grip got it okay so if TJ you held your right hand down here the Hub path would move to the middle point of that this is a pivot point got it yep yep exactly so when you're just holding it normal it's just right in the middle just right in the middle of exactly and then the center mass of the club is just the balance point of the club so if you just hold your club like this it's that point right there so we got two points we're looking at we got Hub path yep and we got Center of mass path of the club exactly yep and just where it's moving in space got and you'll see this sometimes um I see it on Instagram every once in a while where they'll take Tommy Fleetwood and they'll look at the club head and where it's swinging in space but they what would be really cool and it would blow people's minds is if they did a hand path or Hub path at the same time so this one's trippy okay let's see it okay so in the back swing I'll just show this first te um for most players that we really love and there's different extremes to this the hands you'll be able to see just the hands and where they're moving in space in the back swing the hands will be slightly inside the transition into impact so in essence the hands are here okay so if we looked at like P3 we' see the hands here if we looked at P5 and went you see the hands here so they go that way and transition they go out okay whichever we go huh it's over the top freaking me out okay got it this is where people get all whacked out compared to where the center of mass of the club is in Space Center Mass is on top of the plane and then in transition it goes under the plane got it to do that look at where the hands are now I'm not saying everybody that you go just shove the hands out here somewhere they go there because as you drop go into some Bend and then inevitably you're going to start turning there goes the hands the chest rotation kicks them out there a little bit exactly but here's the problem that a lot of folks have and this is what we were talking about when we first started is we want the club to go under the planer I want to hit it from the inside so I can draw it so what people do without even realizing it they is they'll do it yeah so I'll go out here and then I want the hands or the Hub path I'm going to get it in uhhuh okay great well most of the time when I do that what does that do to the to the shaft it's actually steepening the shaft steepens it so too much adduction active adduction and extension here the problem with this now so now I just moved into kind of this delivery position I would love my arms to swing forward yeah you don't got room I don't got room baby so what players will do now to just shoot the energy out of it is they'll rotate the pelvis hard and if you watch this trail trail arm where the elbow is it gets thrown out here in space yes so how am I going to hit it consistently straight with the club head doing that massive rotation there through the SH now I I get it there's guys on tour that do that I understand yeah okay but if you're looking to build your golf swing right and you're wanting to kind of Tinker with it it would be nice to have a map of like how do I control this at a higher level so continuing through this so we've got hands are generally more in center of mass out hands go out Center of mass back okay from here now this is trippy yeah where are both of my elbows they're in front of your chest there yep so if I just took away my my left arm this Trail elbow if I just put a sensor on has room to work through here so this is Trail arm adduction this is a good hit feel by the way maybe you could show it fa in the camera there so if I go boom right here this elbow now this is abduction of the of the trail humorous it's going right across me here got it okay so I have room M compared to the other one I don't have room at all so where does it go okay I see it okay y so here's the trippy thing here's the Hub here's the center of mass mhm where's the Hub going through the strike because I'm going to turn and still feel this abduction here where's the Hub going The Hub is working pretty pretty substantially around you through the strike it's curving left yes where is the center of mass going the center of mass is going out that way trippy is all get out yeah so so Hub path is curving left around you the Hub path can curve left which allows the golf club to shoot right it's on this so just think of like if I put a um here I'll just set it up this way I'm just going to cut this circle in half where that golf ball is okay so I've got this is the right half of my circle okay so on this circle we want the center of Mass to be coming from the inside as soon as I get to the left half of the circle we want it to keep curving around and left I see it that would be neutral but if I want to hit a block draw at least out to here it's still got to be going right until it gets the neutral cuz the path has to keep going right right right right right so to do that I need the center of mass more behind me which oh okay so now the center mass is back here further I can still curve this in the same way but look at where the club's going to kick I see there's block draw block draw isn't yeah so for the PE like can again like the people that cringe when they see or think about the hands working out this way right cuz they struggle with this over the top P right they might see our like Spiral videos right where we talk about you know Center Mass up above Center Mass behind and out yep and probably some people misinterpret that to Hands First and they just add more struggles to their plate right exactly but really if you can think about it in terms of center of mass right take the hands out of it right center of mass the hands can work inside in the back swing Center of mass out yep right that is a Trippy look for most people cuz you're like wait that's the wrong spiral but the hands doing that not the not the club exactly and look at that so now the shaft shallows sure stupid word it's just where the center of mass is in space compared to where the Hub path is okay and they move in opposition for our favorite players like if you look at havland his hand path is like whoa in and then goes over a bunch but if you watch where the the center mass of the club goes in transition he has one of the biggest Loops uhhuh right this shape here because he has one of the biggest shapes in hands in hand path okay but they're mooving opposition I see and that's part of the reason why he's one of the most stable guys on tour because his hands get so far out here that now my elbows are in front the center of mass is behind have all this room right here yeah now now the hand pth can really curve left around you EX in front and he's one of the best movers too like his body supports it so when it kicks I mean the club face is like is stable compared to somebody that has more lead arm adduction and Lead shoulder extension M okay so now I've got my elbows pinned back here you'll see every player here extend in the pelvis like with the with the pelvic rotation and then the golf club gets kicked over here so the hands now are getting thrown out and you'll even see some players like the golf club looks like this like now that the center of MK gets back here yeah and the hands are out here so it's like this like weird yeah kick cuz they might have the the idea of like okay let me get the club left around me which is okay you got the club left around you force is just make it do it and you'll see so many guys on the Range like okay I got to get it inside here and they're just totally screwed because now I can't control the bottom it's always going to be an upward hit kind so never compr yeah that's General stuck stuck means that the club's not behind you it means the hands are behind you oh okay hands are in front club Behind that's not St oh dude it's in front of me hello I can control this boom okay okay so let's go so let let's see let's see a havland esque pattern so this will be outside of yours because you're in like super neutral range sure so I got to exaggerate it a little bit Yeah so I want you to really focus on the hands being in and then they're able to go out in transition yep and then you just hit it right okay okay let's just mess around with it go big hin here yeah controlling the Hub and what's really interesting is it probably still felt fairly stable through there it did feel very stable through there okay now don't you dare try to like flip it or anything like that and like do anything crazy okay okay so we're not trying to lose the face at all understood but let's work the Hub in the opposite direction so it's out to in and hit okay okay so you could think of this as like hand path under rather than Hub under EX exactly so you're you're still controlling the hands you're not trying to do anything to the center of mass yep so big old loop with with the hands big one big loop with the hands SC I can do that yep did I do it it's well yeah absolutely Lo Loop for sure absolutely what did it feel like through the strike prob felt different it felt different yeah well number one I hadit a little fat but it felt less stable definitely with the face EX exactly and the fat is always going to be there te because as soon as somebody goes here to get this looping under where where what am I going to do in order to to help that go under now the exactly so now the Bottom's all whacked and as soon as you rotate and there's another reason people extend in the pelvis is just to try to thrust that forward and catch the ball right there's a general block yeah I see right that's also why it's it can be kind of Speedy like you can hit it okay distance um but my gosh you're never compressing it like the speed in the club you can have the same amount of speed either way but the efficiency out of the strike and the D dynamics of the club and its interaction with the golf ball are going to be totally totally different there huge here is you've in order to control the center of mass at a really high level the first thing that you need to be able to do is control the Hub okay okay so with a lot of our Juniors what's fun these little short clubs yeah and so if anybody has um like an old set at home just take one just saw it off just I mean this looks just like a a grip um Okay cool so they can practice hand path without worrying about what the club's doing yet exactly exactly so you can just go all right the hands are in here now as they go up and they start to to make this General shape again you're not just trying to shove this out here MH boom but you can see where the hands hands are there yeah compared to where they were in the back swing so it's here to there here to there now you'll start to get in a better you'll start to feel where the center of mass of the club would be here when you start to do that and then from there all right I can let the arms fire as I turn bam and there's impact boom boom boom boom and that'll help your ability like everybody's ability to control the center mass at a way higher level and your ability to control through the strike and a much higher level with less face rotation okay I dig it more consistent shots yeah fun control that Hub to control the center of mass I dig it man I dig it too goodies this has genuinely been a joy of ours to film these sessions and get to talk about these things and nerd out on a daily weekly basis so thank you for watching uh we are approaching another Milestone here on YouTube thank you for all the support we're getting very very close to 5,000 subscribers once we hit that 5,000 number we're going to be picking a random commenter on this particular video to give another swing analysis session so if you'd like to enter to win that all you got to do is comment and if you have a question even better because we get to answer that for you so thank you so much for watching we'll see you guys soon [Music]\n",
      "same a b and a d duct but you've got to get the golf club at p5p 5.5 arranged properly boom yep just a good solid hit same system though what was that like I felt really good it's messy right yeah that right there like your response is exactly what we're looking for out of every single freaking player sure right [Music] we're back we're back what do you want to talk about today well been seeing a lot of comments in there in regards to arm structure really good questions about back swing what the wrists do like really everything in here okay I think we can go over that my first question to you is how do you define the arms and how do you define the hands like is there a cut off in your mind sure I mean I think we've talked about this before like anything below wrist or or what forearm mid forearm yeah is hand action right and then anything above there up into the shoulder line is arm action yeah right and I I really think it's important to like differentiate the two because sure like if you just look at anatomically like the forearm section and anatomically the upper arm section like there's one bone here there's two bones here sure right like this can do this and this if I if I rotate it it looks completely different like that's an internal and external compared to pronation and supination okay so what this is doing directly affects down here when we think of the hands we think from below the wrist so if I do anything in here that's a pronation supination action that's that's the two bones in here directly affects the hand though exactly the ulnar and the radius is is totally affecting what the hand itself is doing got it so that's why we go cut off is right here at the elbow all the way down to the fingertips that's hand action and arm actions up here okay cool right so that's just our definition by the way you can have your own definition that's just how we see things yeah um let's talk about arm actions specifically okay in this video so anything above the elbow exactly anything above the elbow we might dabble down in here but this is just going to be like secondary to what I'm talking about here yep exactly to the arms got it I'd like to reverse engineer this um from the standpoint of if we just look at the golf swing in general we have a load phase and we have an unload phase so let's start with the unload phase and then we can work backwards because it's really important to start to identify like how the arms do hit the ball because it does it's a great feeling I think a lot of times we there's this we get misconstrued sometimes in that like once we're in P5 to delivery or the finish of the load phase then now we just don't do anything with the arms and you just turn and it just makes it feel like these just are like back here in space somewhere and there's never this hit when there should be like the arms do fire the body does fire it's the whole system that fires yeah so let's let's first describe this go ahead and give me your clothes and go ahead and just put both arms up in front of you here just like this show me lead arm AB a b duction exactly okay okay show me trail arm a deduction adduction that is the hip that we're looking for so this look here that look right there yeah and it's a really it's it's kind of a fun like hit feel because if I had something in my hands right here and I just went Wham exactly it's a it's a strong hit you can feel like the whole upper spiral really helping facilitate that meaning from like the ribs to the top like the bottom of the ribs to the top of that yeah okay like you can feel lat you can feel posterior line you can feel Frontline like you feel like anterior you feel everything it's just a good solid boom okay and it feels stable okay now the reason that you're able to do that teach go ahead and go this way perfect both of your elbows if I put a sensor here and a sensor there or in front of your torso meaning there's your torso line okay right from an anterior this would be posterior torso line okay okay anterior torso alive see how ball sensors are in front of that so you have room for this Trail elbow complex to fire across uh-huh because they're out in front exactly okay okay that's what we want just hold on to that thought both elbows at delivery are going to be in front of the Torso that's what we're looking for okay okay gotta so show the load face so the load phase again is from P1 to P5 that's how we are generalizing the load phase and then the unload phase is going to be from P5 to pap9 whatever the Finish is okay let's go from P1 to just P4 the top of the backswing okay yep so this is an issue that we see a lot of players do when they try to shallow the golf club they will actively adduct this lead arm so the lead humerus will go into the chest okay and what that feels like I just did is I I took the center of mass of the club which is right up here and I got it behind or under the plane great that is a way to shallow it it's not the preferred way because now we have an issue if I just take away you stay right where you're at in space I'm going to take away the club okay and I want to take away your lead arm so just put it behind your back good here's the issue we have this elbow now here is TJ's trunk or torso is behind that point in space okay so now if he wants to fire this arm the way that he's going to fire the arm like where the forces are going to go as he turns forward [Music] we'll get thrown out this way this point in space gets thrown out and away this way exactly because if it didn't you'd feel kind of stuck through here it's just if there's not a hit you'd have to trap it back here this doesn't feel powerful this feels this feels way more powerful got it like all the energy all the forces can spit out but the problem with that is now like if we dabble down in here the Hub path which I think we've talked about a little bit before it's just the point in space that's in between the hands it's a pivot point that Pivot Point again if my Trail elbow gets trapped back here so again lead arm abduction see where the elbow gets thrown so now as I start to turn see where the Hub path got thrown yeah out to the yeah right no longer can it radically curve which is what we want we want it to curve right around this complex that's the stability feel and I can hold load for longer when this elbow just gets spit see how all the load gets thrown out yes the Hub gets thrown out the rate of rotation the club face gets whacked right the bottom out is way more difficult to control it's just much more difficult to control the bottom the hit and it doesn't feel as organized so just generally feels kind of Grody got it so yeah that's shallowing however I just got both of the sensors well at least one of them trapped behind my torso and it no longer can swing I no longer can simply adduct this lead arm got it okay so let's go back up to P4 sure and this one again is kind of an interesting feel if we're focusing on this lead sensor lead elbow sensor with this kind of an action trying to point that sensor Towards the Sky see how this never lowered stayed up yeah it stayed up but that action this is an active action meaning you're focused on here right that is internal rotation along with lead shoulder flexion that's an up move okay the combo makes it look that way got it so shoulder flexion would be this yeah internal rotations of this exactly that feeling that you just showed right there is a combo of those two things and what you just showed when you were just doing this this is a combo of them both just lead lead arm internal rotation would just spin this in space yeah this point doesn't really move yep okay so this isn't what we're talking about I'm trying to get this going that way see how the Hub path The Hub point doesn't really move in space yes I'm keeping it in the same same spot so Hub Point meaning this middle part of the exact hands here right so if we kept that right here okay and you felt that action that's a combo of shoulder flexion and internal rotation if you show just internal rotation sure the Hub path goes sure so it didn't really do anything here which is what I want to get at so let's go back up to P4 okay so again if we're looking at this just going okay now because of this active action what did this do passively externally rotated yeah and it got back out in front of you so there's some amount of adduction right there got it okay so I'm going to take this away from you okay keep this inspect there you go now again this is in front so you have space for this arm to Simply adduct now just show abduction there you go so abduction is just this action right here boom exactly that action you can already feel probably as the athlete like what's the face doing right there super stable super stable meaning that the rate of rotation is still rotating but it's much less yes the forces got shot out that way exactly so put that arm right where you were again there you go see where my hand is just give me a high five hard there you go see how that's a good solid hit do it again firmer there so you can hit with whatever amount of paste that you would like like you can really hit like if you're hitting driver Wham that can go yeah if I want to hit a 70 yard wedge boom yep exactly but it's so much easier to regulate this space in here which is probably going to be around the P5 P5 5.5 range all the way through to p8 which is like the fully unload roughly fully unload phase sure right it's just super stable you can manage energy you can manage bottom mount you can manage the face so much better got it so if we go back to this again the image that I need players to have in their mind is at address see how both elbows both sensors are in front yes okay and let's do this from down the line because we can just see things better this is really important too if I early adduct which is a way to move the golf club if I move the golf club simply with the arms right off the bat so this abduction piece see how I didn't move here at all where'd that sensor go yep behind the Torso line got it behind the Torso line now I'm now I'm immediately stuck in the first foot of my golf swing so that's why we like the upper spiral leading so now see how both of the both sensors are in front of the Torso yeah still in front here exactly and that's kind of in our minds the finish of the backswing and the start of transition so transition is with the arms the lead shoulder will go into flexion to make this lift okay and now from there it's going to keep lifting as I go into internal rotation so from right here I'm going lead shoulder flexion internally rotated okay so that's the finish of back swinging into transition and that's the whole transition that's the whole transaction so this would be the upper spiral see the arms aren't doing anything yet I've almost fully turned here but the arms are still down because they haven't done anything okay I have an adducted I haven't gone into lead shoulder flexion I haven't done any of that yet sure you might you might just feel a little bit in the hands to get the center of mass of the club up that's just a little bit here the arms didn't do anything no no adductor yep exactly no flexion right we're just going spiral might load the hand system again from the from the elbow down in the fingertips but now from there lead shoulder flexion going into internal rotation is what's going to feel like you hit yeah and it'll fall all the way back down in here boom to P5 yeah so that's not happening up to P4 that's happening in to P5 there you go all the way to P5 so the reason that that dropped right there the main reason like it's lowering is because you're dropping the pelvis ah okay so this is why transitions so hard there's like 900 things like that there's so many things going on exactly where his backswing is like okay upper spiral and maybe a little bit of Trail wrist like Rd and extension Okay cool so it's like there's backswing now there's shoulder flexion lead arm internal dropping swaying the ribs all that stuff can happen in transition this video is only meant for what's going on in here though sure so all I'm really doing is lead shoulder flexion along with internal rotation of this this lead upper arm if I drop now I would look like roughly in the P5 sure for both sensors right now in front of that Rib Line or that chest exactly so this goes back to what I can do from right here I can feel lead arm a b duction Trail arm aduction there's the hit there's the hit let's see how stable that is yeah and you can use all that as long as you're in that in front of you position exactly compared to if I'm here and a lot of players will transition by going lead shoulder flexion in the abduction ah see that action so now from here I can't add duct because my torso is in the way that's where you see the face flash so exactly which is I mean there's guys on tour that do that sure you can do it it's just we're looking at like how do we manage the bottom better yes and a lot of people like fail to understand that really high level players have developed a golf swing that we don't really want to touch the main big quirks that make them good we want to manage it for them and have that athlete better understand their system and what makes them great got it we're talking about building a golf swing that would be a preferred pattern that would be so easy to manage that's why we like guys like Neiman Mido hovland all those guys have this kind of a pattern plus this flexion action gives me more room in here to operate compared to extension see how that's in the way sure it almost forces a higher rate of rotation in the club face because I'm in the way my Pelt like my whole Indian's in the way now I can't manage it as well yeah so for developing players it might be better to try to move towards a more stable Club face through the strike one that's easier to manage especially when you don't have like all the Time in the World to practice I have that conversation all the time like like this game has gotten a whole lot a lot easier when I didn't have to rely on this pattern exactly I was I got good at it yeah but through like loads and loads of practice daily daily timing timing time exactly but I think that's just a question that every single athlete needs to ask themselves is it doesn't really matter the amount of time that you've worked on something it matters truly how skilled you are sure so if you've practiced for two years and you shoot some 65s yeah okay great we probably want to manage what you've built because it's working really well right if you've practiced for 10 years and you're shooting 85s we probably need to get rid of the quarks that are stalling you out so go ahead and place them with better ones clean up some of those areas so it's just a very honest conversation that you want to have with yourself sure different topic okay but let's let's show how to go ahead and put this into kind of some action here so let's do a modified two piece all you're going to do teach is work into P5 appropriately here good so there's P 5.5 which is just fine right here's great and appropriately for this video means simply both sensors are in front of this torso right here primarily this trail trail sensor so I'm about here yep out front here exactly now from right there all I want to see do we're just going to chip one into the screen pure add or a B duction abduction and pure adduction to hit this ball yep exactly there you go excellent let's go a step further here we'll do the same thing into P5 okay P5 or P 5.5 where you're managing the sensors boom excellent now same abduction and adduction but let the chest just softly rotate with it good and what you'll see like if you freeze the clip for folks up there you'll see how stable that club face is I mean there's hardly any rotation at all it's just like the face is just like just matching the path okay now let's go to like 50 maximum swing here but in your mind's eye the image that I want you to have is you are just going back here and almost placing this system you could throw like three points of interest the center of mass of the balance point of the club and both sensors in the elbows that triangle what do you want that arranged you're just going to play sit there but keep going and tap the ball in into the screen okay okay so just show where P 5.5 is first where you're going to be boom see where you're at so in your mind's eye okay go back to address instead of moving to there you're going to move through there softly but in your mind's eye you're just going to place it there and then turn an a b and a deduct there you go good let's do that again okay now what's really nice with this exercise exercise is speed is the thing that will kind of level everything out we're taking all that away so you really have to understand this system of hidden here to feel really good okay place it there a b a deduct along with a little chest rotation very cool and what we want like and this is like every athlete just wants to to sense this is how much of this do I have how much of that do I have so you're just managing this triangle of right the center mass of the club and each sensor in each elbow and you'll just you should feel like oh someone were just so good and you can just feel this nice hit in here where that doesn't really rotate all that much these also don't really rotate all that much it's just this nice solid hit sure yeah it's just like bump got it that's like our preferred pattern of arm action there okay okay so now like we were talking about before where if you're really smacking my hand you're still going to feel like you're placing it here I'm going to throw throw some more energy into that and we'll see what happens so the same a b and a d duct but you've got to get the golf club at P5 P 5.5 arranged properly boom yep just a good solid hit same system though foreign like your response is exactly what we're looking for out of every single freaking player sure yeah right so we just want these little bits that we can nibble on that just go oh just make it feel real good it feels really good yeah and and what we're always looking for as athletes is we're feeling good in the hit phase P5 to p8 is like the hit phase this is the boom this is the unload yeah if you feel good there it's probably because you set yourself up so T1 to P5 to manage the space easier and better fair enough yeah so that's the arms baby that's the arms put some sensors on those elbows and let's get to work keep them in front right that's right exactly awesome stuff uh comment below let us know if you have any questions we'd be happy to answer let's do it [Music]\n",
      "good now drop engine sling good feel late that was yeah let's do the same exact thing with a golf club okay uh drop engine sling there we go [Music] okay we got another one this is great because again we we talk so much about the load phase which is from again in our minds from P1 to P5 okay what we don't talk a lot about is from P5 what the heck do we do from there sure by the way the reason that we stop talking right in there is because from like P 2.5 to P5 there's like I don't know 90 things that happen so it's like really important to organize that area because if we organize really nicely to P5 it just makes it so much easier to hit a golf ball from there without really even having to worry too much however we still see people that screw it all up even if they get into P5 really nicely they just don't know what to do from there and I think a lot of that maybe they've learned a map in the in the past that doesn't quite jive with where they currently are like maybe they've learned to do this little forearm rotation action yep I learned that when I was a junior this little shake the hand drill right exactly so if you're trying to do that and all of a sudden you even get yourself into a better load position yes you can still screw it up you can still screw it up nine ways to Sunday like it's it's just it's really important to have a map from there how do I move through that unload phase all the way to finish which is kind of this like P9 sure phase got it uh this is a good picture this is important because there's this this is the start of the of the unload phase so I'm turning turning turning if I were to helicopter the golf club out of this window at like a 45 degree angle like away from the target sure and up away from the ground like on this angle in 3D space it would go through the same window in space every single time so if you were to actually Huck this thing your helicopter that direction yep exactly the same window every single time got it that's the finish of the unload okay yep it's important to understand that so how this really works we're going to talk about this idea of a dual fulcrum system okay so teach come on in here and you can kind of be our our shower yes we go to P5 okay we have two fulcrums and I'm just gonna we're gonna use one big lever for right now so let's take the trail arm off okay we're gonna have two points in space this lead shoulder complex okay and the lead hand complex okay this is a fulcrum meaning that like any any joint in our body can move that point in space is a lever see how this can unload right here so I can load it I can unload it okay okay this point right here you can load and unload so I'm going to take the club away from you so this would be kind of a loaded phase show just no no body movement here just an unload just an A B duct hit there you go so see how this is a point in space that the whole system is swinging from okay so if we go back into this I'll be the shower now okay this would be a single fulcrum where I'm not going to load or unload this system at all I'm just going to swing this system so which one can I put more speed into this system or if I loaded this system now definitely if you loaded that system exactly the hand system correct yes the hand system so in the wrist joint complex like this area right here we have a pivot sure and we can do a lot of different things in here but in essence I can load it see I have angle here as soon as I loot it lose angle that's unloaded okay okay got it so what people will screw this up is they will do a number of different things because of the map in their mind so hop back in here for us let's go to P5 nicely so a lot of people that we see see this face right now is pointing in this direction yeah so it's well away from the target correct wouldn't it be easy to just get it back on the target line right here so now I've thrown the club oh great now I have the face on the Target in my mind yep that's a map that I'm now now freaking I'm good okay well where are all the forces going when I do this out down and out right so to create space and not just stick it in the ground right here yep what would you have to do with your body extend and everything works up so we'll see guys drop do all this great stuff into P5 try to get the golf club going or the face back on the target line and now all of a sudden I have to create space and they just screwed up the whole system so they get into P5 here yep and then kind of in a rush to get the face down Square to the Target line we'll throw it this way yep we'll just try to get it onto the target line right there yep and now you kinda have to do that through the strike exactly and now they just just whacked out this whole dual fulcrum type of a system okay because they threw yeah so let's let's show it in a rope and we can probably slow this down sure go ahead and just hold that so it's roughly like a little bit shorter than just a normal golf club and again we'll do this from face on okay okay and just lay it on your back for a backswing good now just whoosh it away from right there okay now that is thrown away this way okay so you can see that TJ do that one more time okay go ahead you can see that most of it is just thrown directly from yes this furthest point away system meaning this is a this is a lever point in the hands I can load and unload this system just on its own that would be a single fulcrum system okay very much speed in that just that no okay okay so instead let's put it up over the top of your your uh Trail shoulder again so in order for TJ to do this by the way you can see the hand complex load he's got some amount of Rd there's some lead wrist flexion like this all loads up right here you can feel that now go ahead and just zip the chest and yeah exactly and let the hands follow that they'll unload secondary there you go there you go where is the unload happening in your mind yes out at like P infinite it's like way over here it's not down here kind of what you were describing like if you're going to helicop in a golf club it all happens there way late you wouldn't attempt to helicopter the golf club from P5 to p7 no you wouldn't it just doesn't feel straight in the ground you throw it straight in the ground it just would like stall out the whole freaking system okay you gotta create space light blah blah it's just a bad MAP but I understand where people are coming from because they're just trying to get the friggin racket the face back like on the Target or hit got it this feels like a hit it's a very early hit but in people's minds sometimes that's the map sure okay so the main fulcrum that we have the the first the leading the primary fulcrum is in the shoulder complex these are hitters okay like I'm I'm hitting hard here with the arms first okay the secondary right the following unload is in the hand system okay okay so what I would like to see this is just a good map that people should have go ahead and hold on to the golf club again I'll take your real friends flimsy shaft away okay let's go to P5 boom good here's what people need to manage there's some folks that go I'm never going to unload this and I'm just going to turn turn turn turn turn turn turn there's impact this just keeps spiraling all the way up into finish doesn't feel like you'd have to work so hard and just like block bottom out there yes yes because they think that okay the main engines here there's no secondary it'd be like stepping on the gas hard your engine just goes and the wheels don't do excuse me okay so it's it's from right here there is a blend of both of these at the appropriate time to have Max efficiency okay okay now for most folks most folks not all folks this is the main engine that they need to feel okay because everybody's feels are a little bit different but this action right here main engine and that's just a chest rotation yes essentially the energy that I actively put in my chest will then leak into the arms through the hands down through the shaft and into the club head okay out got it because of this got it not because I'm actively here again most some people need this active sure some people do it's not the majority of people got it so you need to identify if that's you or not understood right to to feel really nice nice in the hit Area okay because for some folks there is like an active hit here because they've just trained this so much that they have to oh I get to unload the golf club yep but again for most it's because they're trying to actively unload the hands and arm system to get the club unloaded and released because in their mind they think that this is where they need to unload the majority of energy got it where it's actually continued all the way up into full finish where would I helicopter that of through that window exactly and you need to learn to manage that sure but the Dual fulcrum system is this system is the primary okay meaning because the chest is Revan won't go ahead and wrap okay good now see I'm holding this back River see it Go yep so that what's nice is I can load this system by starting the engine yeah now I've loaded it more okay now I can hit so that's a scratched fascial line that posterior arm line at the lead arm now I can hit here like the more you stretch that band the more that now I can unload but it does need to unload you don't just keep stretching that son of a gun sure it's got to unload it it's got to unload at the same time if the club's up there and I'm dropping and I start to turn the hand system is also going to be well loaded like see how that's in a big flexion state right there big load here so this whole system is loaded but again what actually happens not necessarily what you'll feel but what will actually happen is the engine needs to start to Roar it'll stretch this system here there we go now we're loaded so now you'll feel the arm system unload and this will respond whoosh all the way out there you go see it just sling yeah now we have a super efficient dual fulcrum system that's precise but Max maximum speed yeah efficiency efficiency that's that's what I feel as well exactly so the whole system gets whacked when people in their Mind's Eye I want more speed and the system gets jacked because they think speed comes from somewhere other than this dual fulcrum system got it so let's see one where we can do it kind of in slow-mo but what I want to see is this like load phase fully finished to the load phase at P5 and then because of this dual fulcrum system again engine all the energy leaks through the arms through the hands through the shaft and into the club head that's where it's going it's transmitting through that all the way up into that P10 there you go so we should just feel like see TJ just go and it all gets slung up into that finish let's do that with the uh with the Rope okay just lay it over that trail shoulder good now drop engine sling good I feel late that was yeah that's out there again yep and it's over here now let's do the same exact thing with a golf club okay so it's up drop engine sling good let's do it with uh in one motion okay but in your mind it's like you're getting this the Rope like slung up here then you're gonna drop there goes the engine in the chest and all the energy gets slung out into that P10 there you go and showing just a P10 so you're not folded okay drop engine sling there we go what'd that feel like in your mind's eye that it fully unloaded yeah again right through here good where did it feel like in your mind that it started to unload actually a lot earlier than that okay right right yeah and that's for your system some other guys like will go it never unloads and never unloads okay there it started downloading finished yeah right others are like it starts to unload back in here because they feel the arm the hand system start to like get the golf club going everybody's a little bit different with that sure yours is going to be individualistic to you and your old map of hit compared to a better map of hit probably for most people who have that map of early hit yep it'll feel like the hit comes super late so late yes like they're almost fully up here and then there it goes got it for other guys that are like they're just trying to hold on to this sucker which are a few it's probably one out of 20. sure probably see yeah the they need to feel like okay I can like whoosh this energy out of the hands yep as they're going here because I already have this nice fulcrum gone the engine's gone yeah the wheels just are stalled so let it out let the wheels go you got to decide which kind of person you are sure and then mess with your system to feel really efficient as a player you do that you start to feel real nice as long as you can get into delivery really nicely agree this is the whole system baby that's our model baby let's hit some flushies word uh word [Music] thank you\n",
      "okay I'm just gonna load okay now from here I'm going to unload there's UD flexion and you'll see like how the shaft the center of mass of the golf club goes behind and then out right once you do those little two pieces then you can just kind of blend it [Music] okay we're talking about hands well hand action so this would be kind of a cool one because there's lots of different ways to do this we're going to talk only about our preferred way but everybody feels things slightly different based on their own like metal maps of movement how they get this thing back to the back to the golf ball we're going to talk about everything that these guys can do in your swing to like control face where the golf club is the whole deal just so you know terms that we're going to speak on we've got the center of mass of the golf club which is really the balance point of the golf club so it's right there the Hub which is the point in space in the middle of my grip okay so it's right in there so we've got hub center and mass and then face which is how it's oriented in space this way so the openness or the closure of the face based on where the center of mass and the Hub is in space okay so that's a lot to manage um and for for those individuals that through the strike feel good day in and day out tour players those guys are absolute artists and Geniuses when it comes to those three points um and they might not even know it but they figured it out fair enough okay so what our job is is to kind of expedite this process for players so that they understand how to feel good in the strike area okay let's go to like P 5.5 P6 somewhere in there and just freeze their thiege good so what we want like if we're right in here our favorite patterns so if you watch hobland and how he works through the strike you watch Neiman and how he works through the strike there is only almost only a trail wrist extension which is where TJ is in space right now to flexion unload okay okay so if you don't turn it all and we just show from extension a reflection to extension we would see that sure see the slow rate of rotation in the face so go back to the load okay go through the unload slowly beautiful so we just want that okay okay so go ahead and face the camera now when you do that go back to 5.5 or P6 okay good so we're in extension of this Trail rest okay now go ahead to flexion notice how when we do this The Hub doesn't really move in space that much it just stayed right in here okay what makes the Hub move primarily is the curvature of our body so now if we have the curvature of your body and the unload there you go now the hub's up here and that's what creates the strike got it so that's actually fairly simple so you're just turning and you are unloading the golf club from if we just keep talking about this Trail hand from extension to flexion that's really all that we're doing so the complexities are more in the backswing and into the transition okay okay so that's what we want to gain access to is there so how do we set ourselves up for Success so that you actually can do that sure and not just recover the golf club because of where it's at at the end of transition okay that's the question that a lot of people should be asking themselves sure okay so let's go backswing first head and hold the golf club right up in front um and I'm going to take the golf club from you keep your hands right here we'll just keep talking about this Trail hand okay pronation supination what would that do to the golf club what would pronation do to the club pronation would shut the face would shut the face and let's do that again and just make sure that this point in space right here in this elbow joint doesn't move there you go what's easy to do guys because if if I just do that that is internal rotation of the humerus and instead of arm action we're talking hand action only so this point in space is going to stay show pronation again sure supination there you go so that's only the ulnar and the radius rotating so that's keeping this whole upper arm segment still yeah for sure but for the sake of like just this video it's what's going on in the hands okay okay so if you hold the golf club just for that trail hand show um supination opens the face go back to stock show Foundation shuts the face okay great let me have that okay Rd and UD so this is Rd radial deviation UD is ulnar deviation okay yeah we talked about hinge a lot problem with hinge is you can do two different things to hinge it okay okay so you can go radial you go ulnar okay what does that make the golf club look like just goes up and down so now we're managing the center of mass it's just going up and down here okay or I could say hinge extension flexion so when somebody goes hinge the club well how yeah because you can do three things you could do only RDU D you only extension reflection or you do a blend of both okay okay so if you're holding the golf club here go ahead and show extension inflection there you go what we prefer to see is a combo of three actions in the backswing here okay and the backswing meaning like we're only talking about to like Pete 2.5 P3 Max so that then we can Tran go into the transition we can transition into the transition okay okay but we love to see guys like if you watch Dustin Johnson he just presets all these movements early yeah like that exactly and then he'll start to turn second that's why DJ looks the way that he does and the huh the hub goes away from him early okay because he is throwing extension along with pronation okay so if you just hold this golf club up in front of you show pronation of this Trail would would close the face okay extension of the trail rest would make the golf club go here now that's interesting because the the center of mesh just went up right yes because what we talked about before is extension and flexion just makes the center Mass go side to side and RD and UD make the golf club go up and down so why did the center of mass go up because we had a little pronation in there huh so if you go pronation and now you go just into extension so notice how TJ's hand looks this way yeah if I go under extension there goes the golf club now there's an amount a certain amount of of radial deviation in there there's a little bit of a hinge sure not a ton for most players what they feel but really what that feels like is this Force but now it's moving up in front of me instead there you go exactly now when you do that do that again okay look it go ahead see how that club is shutting down yes which is awesome so we're shutting the face okay got it okay you can see that because a lot of the time like see this lead wrist now bow out the bow is more of a flexion State okay go back to neutral see how now we don't have this bow just show rotation of the shaft there you go see how that goes into a bow state so this is bowing out more it's going front there you go exactly just a little twist what's the face doing yeah it's you're exactly you're twisting the shaft in space and that face shuts and the face shuts boom done there's 2.5 so there's the backswing okay okay now there's other videos on what we prefer to see with like Spirals and whatnot this is just on how the hands go so what would be kind of cool is you can geek around a little bit and go what's my body doing the backswing what do my hands do to really support that because again what we're looking for is a low rate of rotation in the club face through the strike and that low rate of rotation is purely because of the trail risk going from extension to flexion the lead rest would be going from flexion to extension so it's that unload it's a low rate of rotation so if you blend this idea of what the hands do you go back and watch some of our other videos on say Body Action right you can start to get an idea of what pieces go together yes to support what you're trying to do exactly exactly okay so let's go just into the backswing so right here like P 2.5 or P3 so again just to reiterate we've got a pronation of the trail wrist okay trial hand structure an extension of the trail wrist now we're loaded okay so if you just kept spiraling turn turn turn up to the top nothing changes here at all you didn't do anything because you got it done early just like DJ yeah okay now as you drop okay and then start to bounce into right Bend there you go see where the center of mass because of that right Bend just went it's starting to go down here 's the funny thing some players need to feel an active if we just keep standing on this Trail wrist UD so ulnar deviation looks like this okay that u d makes the center of mass of the golf club continue to go down but if you're in an extension state with this Trail rest if you throw UD what you're also going to leak into is supination of this Trail arm so if you watch TJ here there's UD and it leaks into supination of this arm now we're good now we're getting the center of mass down here some players need to feel this others don't need to because they get the golf club far enough behind them and underneath the plane that they're good to go so it's a passive reaction to what the ribs are doing okay meaning that I'm in lead lateral and then I'll go into Trail lateral Bend here so if you do that again just let's let's show that show a show of backswing good now TJ is still in lead lateral Bend right here in his armpit and now as he transitions he's going to go into Trail lateral Bend and see how the center and mass of the golf club goes back it's going down and back because of just this trading of the bins yeah so some guys are fine right there okay others need that active UD supination to keep the center of mass going down you gotta understand and identify who you are okay okay now for your pattern do you feel that or do you not feel that like an active Force here depends on the shot I'm trying to hit okay and again we just put out a video on draw versus Spade if you want to get an idea of that yep if I want to start the ball more right yep I feel a little bit more active great and if I want to start it left I don't feel as much of that as I'm just curving around so that's really interesting so if you're a guy that's trying to work on this stuff and you're starting the golf ball left and you're sick and tired of it guess what you can add in a little bit of active the beauty there and what you're doing what you're trying to tap in there is you're you're really starting to control so go back in there again just into that delivery right there good excellent what you're starting to control because we've got these forces see how this is like bowed out right here that's what closes the face we got the face closed we don't need to close it anymore we need to get the center of mass going down and continuing to go down that's the thing that your pet you're locking into because if you're one that starts at left you start now turning and it stays on top too much there's your unload and it goes left because if you look at every single like high level player boom they look this way at the strike so I'm dual WD yeah that's UD this is UD yeah which is a weird look right for most people they're like what is that yeah well and what we're exaggerating there is we're delaying the unload when we're showing this sure right but if I'm actually showing like that's what a tour player would would roughly that looks more or less accurate yeah yeah yeah even guys like Fleetwood that keeps it he keeps us on here okay I still have some degree of UD it's not as much so it's not like a dress would be here it'd be slightly exactly exactly exactly so a lot of that is just passive because the the forces that the club is is putting on the hand structure as it so that Center of mass is going down which pulls those wrist structures exactly there's the ud yep and then there's impact yep okay and as it washes out then it then it's it's still in a little bit of a UD action there but see how it's like I got it in the ud I'm not changing it no and bouncing out of there right which wouldn't really happen anyways yeah unless somebody's pulling on the shaft right that happens yeah yeah but when it left but yeah we're just looking to have the golf club all right I'm in the appropriate amount here now some people need to feel like it keeps going down like we're talking about with those guys that start at left keep that Center Mass going down so what closes the face down then because right now if I'm doing this this looks open it stays open right yeah to the Target uh chest rotation chest rotation and what what happens then too is we need a passive for most people it's a passive unload which means that I'm in in this goes back to the first thing we talked about it's an extension as you start to rotate boom there it gets washed out and now it's going into flexion it's a trail wrist so that helps Square it down as well that's what yep exactly so we're not just getting there and holding on to the darn thing yeah you just don't hold it and hold it and hold it now some people need again later on this curve to feel it unload some people need it earlier if you're one that needs it earlier then that'll probably feel like an active unload of the extension there you go see how TJ's like actively hitting right there with the hands but if you're a player that needs it later it might feel like you're turning until it washes out light most of the time the more passive that we can be the better because then there's like anytime I'm actively throwing something in muscle activation muscle activation that leaks into tension okay and and really good unloaders have very little tension in that space exactly so your muscles can elongate and all the forces can get out of the instrument into the club head speed yep okay but that's what we're looking for is like how do we use all these different things that our hands and arms can really just the hands can do and it leaks into the arms what they can do to manage those three pieces okay okay so if we go into this one last time rdud makes the center of mass of the golf club just go up okay okay this extension of the trail wrist flexion of the trail wrist makes the golf club go side to side and the rotation of the shaft which is pronation and supination of the trail forearm is what makes the face either either shut or open okay if you're managing all of those things and understanding how to manage those things early in your backswing and how we go into transition and then again through the strike now you'll start to understand how to manage the face at the appropriate time see on the unload meaning the Hub and the center of mass relationship as well so a general recap of of kind of the forces we're throwing here as I move into the backswing setting this fairly early right and that's a combo of pronation and extension yup of the trail response of the trail risk complex so that's backswing yep exactly as I move into transition I would feel perhaps a little bit of UD yep followed by wrist extension yes through the strike yep and those would be the forces through those phases people can play with yep so you could think of this as a load phase and an unload phase because I know this is a lot of information to just digest the load phase is the pronation and extension of the trail rest so now now TJ's Trail risk complex is loaded his lead risk complex is loaded but now from there to unload he would feel a UD and flexion followed by flexion pattern there's Duty there's flexion UD there's flexion yep and that's the unload pattern so you could even hit these like little chippy ones where you're in here going okay I'm just gonna load okay now from here I'm going to unload there's UD flexion and you'll see like how the shaft the center of mass of the golf club goes behind and then out right once you do those little two pieces then you can just kind of blend it and now start hitting some like more one motion shots that you'll feel this low that look yeah that's good that will teach you like what it feels like you'll start to understand just in space where the golf club is how shut is it where's the center of mass where's the Hub you'll feel these things more based on your awareness of these actual forces that get thrown in and the actual movements that create those forces you start messing around with that then you'll really start to understand like oh that feels stable yeah meaning it doesn't feel like Latin just kind of gets lost down here that's all just recovery sure based on how you set up like in the fully loaded loaded face mess around with it and ask questions this one's kind of a neat dive sure there's going to be a lot of questions on this throw those in we'll do our best to articulate the answers and the responses to those and some of those those questions are going to be really good and they're going to lead to some other videos that we're going to do in the future so 100 thanks so much that was super fun hit some fleshies baby let's go let's go [Music]\n",
      "is what's leading the club's responding both ways like this is trying to get away from this boom boom boom whatever you want to spiral and you can see like with TJ got those are good how much time he has here to load because as the golf club is floating up here he can drop re-center the ribs all the things that we want to do [Music] here we go here we are what are we doing today well had a lot of questions on sequencing understanding when things should fire when they should be chill yeah all the good things so first let's just Define like what sequencing is like in layman's terms it's just the order of events like this happens and then this happens and then and then and then we kind of stink at trying to do everything now sure yep exactly all at once uh which by the way that doesn't happen in golf swing obviously there's a backswing that then leaks into transition and then leaks into through impact to finish got it handy so those of you that are out there going okay I need to do all nine of these things right now it's just a bad way to go about it you're going to have a lot of difficulty with that so talking about sequencing there's this idea of load and unload the load of the arm line and the unload of the arm line as well as the load of the Spiral line and the unload or the bouncing of spiral wines okay okay so let's just Define both of those really what the online is is it starts right here in TJ sternum it goes across his booby this is all anterior so face on if I'm looking at you here okay this is anterior arm lines so the shoulder complex in front runs down the arms over the Palm over the fingers and then wraps around the fingers and now we're posterior meaning booty view okay got it bump side so now we're going posterior arm line goes all the way across the scaps across the back back here around the fingers again and guess what now our anterior and we attach right there those of you that are going okay well how do I load and how do I unload these things that's why we got this guy okay fascia Works in a pretty cool way in that if I pull on this rubber band okay you take one in sure okay pull on it would it be loaded or unloaded loaded okay unload it there you go so it's really cool if you do that again weird it went in the same direction yeah so one how much energy did you put in Making the Band go this way zero zero so we would call that free energy yeah and it's also precise because it's not like you let it go and it went this way one time and it goes here and there and like all over the place it still goes in the same direction so you get free speed and precision if you know how to sequence the spirals and the arm lines got it okay okay so here we got preferred patterns go ahead and hold on to that guy I don't sure trade yep throw that thing away put it over there okay so let's go ahead and just set up okay there's really two main ways to motor this ball there's one way which we don't prefer which is just shoving the arms back and forth so move that ball to and fro this would be armline load so if you just go from neutral TJ and then show me a backswing this band which is the posterior arm line just loaded in the first two feet of your swing so imagine this band just getting stretched because from neutral see how this like you'll feel it too like those of you that are going to do these exercises which by the way do these exercises you'll hit them better from right here you'll feel how this is like chilled out okay now don't move the body at all just move this lead arm across you feel how this loads you'll feel it stretch in here kind of through the scap this whole lead shoulder complex posterior load yes problem which we'll get into here in just a second okay okay or you can motor that ball with the spiral line got it okay now we've got two different spiral lines right it's like if somebody just painted a blue X in front of me go underneath my armpits and then over the sketch right here got it I want you to use your Trail side meaning it goes underneath your Trail armpit upper spiral line to just start moving but in your mind you're going to keep the ball right here teach so go ahead and set up again and you're just going to keep it here relaxed in the arms but move this upper spiral and this will start to respond good let's do that again now I'd love you to do even better is now go ahead and start moving moving that upper spiral there you go see how it stays for a second and then this responds that's kind of the slo-mo look got it if you wanted to be really sexy you'd move this complex a little bit laterally so in essence she was just going boom see I'm not like really turning much yet I'm just moving the center of mass of my ribs off the ball I.E Stenson 2000 tiger they all early load this lateral drift of the spot of of the center mass of the ribs okay and then spiral second so it's like a one two so if I really want to load that up I might go there you go and look at how the ball feel the ball on the arms respond to that yeah now let's just do that a little bit more dynamically so it's kind of boom boom it's playful um good good and if I can just use that ball for just a second a good way to just get this gone again this is inefficient which we'll get into here in a second if I just start moving this laterally with no spirals yet boom boom boom and again slow-mo I'm going to keep this ball here then I just moved this the center mass of my ribs to my trail side boom boom see how the ball would respond boom boom it's not together it's not online it's Center of mass lateral okay okay A little separation yep so boom boom you can see like boom boom boom boom there's playroom now if I wanted to go ahead and spiral I'd do that second okay okay so what we're doing is we're delaying the load in in two main portions of the arm line for us as right-handed players your lead side posterior arm line and the scap and shoulder complex okay and your anterior Trail side okay so you don't want to load those up too early we're going to load them in transition okay because if we load them here's the pro improper sequencing if I load them early so right now this action is a load like again rubber band right here boom that's a load early boom load early I've got them loaded in the backswing what do fascial lines that are loaded want to do unloaded unload so they're gonna want to unload in the transition area or I'm just going to have to artificially keep them loaded keep them loaded keep them loaded forever which is excess tension which just makes us feel gross both of those feel gross so the ideal would be I'm gonna I'm gonna chill this out I'm gonna chill this out in the backswing whoa so there's backswing so the arm lines aren't loaded see how this is relaxed that's relaxed super chill yeah if I put enough energy in the spiral and the arms do fire they're going to fire up here but in our in our definition this is the finish of the backswing this is the start of the transition we want to load and load throughout transition got it load got it now I'm loaded okay what are what are arm lines that are loaded want to do unload unload so now I've got the unload in this face precise snap of a band happening through impact precise being the operative term it's Precision because it's going to unload in the same way and it's free speed free speed so if you have a fashion line that's loaded it's wanting to snap back plus you're throwing muscle activation into that as well that's like heavy hit and that's in every single sport right if I'm a boxer I go here to separate I just loaded the anterior Trail arm line boom to hit somebody same thing with pitching yep there's this separation right now I can turn and fire got it right like if you just got up here this is like the most unathletic looking thing ever soft right if I just tried to throw a ball this way there's nothing in it as soon as you do this something in it sure now you can knock it got it we want the same thing just golfy okay because throwing a baseball is over Center of mass of my body hitting a golf ball is under the center of mass my body goes under okay okay so if we do this let's do it with uh let's do it with the ball again okay so we'll just we'll just show the sequencing and I'll explain the sequencing of the load phase okay the load phase is from P1 P5 which we call delivery got it okay so let's just show backswing sort of P 2.5 no load no load there you go so you can see even here like a little bit more turn TJ is damn near fully rotated in his chest and in his Spirals and the arms are still down now if there were energy in that okay go back there if there were energy in that the arms would continue to go up as he drops and re-centers now loaded loaded got it great okay let's do that again so we're just going to go to backswing so again no load no load now go all the way through transition to P5 good and even holding on to you right there I can feel this load there's the load phase so the arm lines begin to get loaded and finish their load at the end of transition got it we're at the beginning of transition they start their load at the end of transition they're fully loaded but from P2 to 2.5 here there's really no load happening yet yeah from P1 to P 2.5 yeah absolutely there's no load and as a matter of fact like a good picture for a lot of players right now this arm line I can actually almost anti-load a bit in that it's getting slacked out even more so at the start my midline is right over my hands our preferred pattern is to see the midline outrace The Hub or the hands at the start I see so this is actually more slacked out because it would be going this way relative to my midline meaning a b duction so that's where like that Henrik Stenson look you were talking about right he'll go this way there again there he goes over here it goes that way hands are here now keep turning see how that's out racing oh I see it yep yep there we go now as you bounce these up and and you load these now into P5 now we're loaded see how this now this structure got behind the midline because it's pointing over here got it so it starts in front or I should say starts in line yep moves in front now it's going to move boom there you go exactly and now you can hit the hit is the firing of the lead side upper spiral I mean it's going underneath my lead armpit so there's the hit boom and we can hit with the arms so I've got them like in in delivery whoop this lead arm if we just look at this that's a deducted abduction now if the lead Spiral goes and I go into a b there's a good solid hit and the trail arm is in a b duction going into a deduction so there's a good hit and that's a cool feel you can kind of feel that rubber band right there yep exactly it just goes yeah everything just goes you've loaded up the system and then wants to wash that energy out so you're washing it out and hitting at one time that's like the best feeling ever it just feels right when people go man my golf swing feels really good usually what they're talking about one is they're managing the head area really well so what they've done in in into delivery has just organized them so that now it's very easy to operate in the space okay but you're also feeling sequencing got it sequencing is like the the door that we're opening to rhythm rhythm is like manifested because of how you sequence movement I see it yeah and fascial lines muscle fire it all moves in wave like fashion that's a loop brachiism that moves in waves they're not lightning bolts it's not boom it's you think of just like how a wave moves we've got this build so it's climbing got it and it crests and then it washes out so let's do this with a medicine ball first okay I'll just stand right over here you go right there and we'll do these like a little gentle you'll just toss it to me gently okay yep but what I want to see this is just a good way to kind of drill this out if we've got two points the center of mass of the ribs which is pretty much like just think of where the sternum is that'll help you and the ball the middle of the ball this dude is trying to get away from that dude almost at all times now that doesn't necessarily happen because there's there's times that they're going in the same direction but right now if you just start moving this laterally so no rotation really see how it's it's this distance has got gotten bigger it's elongated now if you start to spiral a bit to turn it over there as soon as this starts to go that direction this guy is like nope and it comes in every centers yep there good thank you good so keep doing that yep exactly boom boom excellent I'll toss one okay okay so again this is trying to separate away from the ball so even these like little we can just call these like little walkouts like we're here boom as soon as the ball starts going in the same direction as the sternum or the center of mass of the ribs the ribs go the opposite direction okay so I'm here oh now they're all going together nope I'm going here now it's going together nope I'm going here boom boom boom great ribbon drill so now if I toss this at it here here just to like load up and move that and motor that in the proper way sure our preferred way got it because that like just eye testing it which one looks better this or this definitely gonna go with option A okay just to eye test Athletics right you're like I like that one more than that one even if that one doesn't look that that bad it's like I like that one that's got that good stuff it's kind of like athlete it's got like athlete yeah exactly so just show the walkout so there's no spirals here we're just going like you'll feel like your center of mass of your ribs is just on a clothesline so there's not a whole lot that's so beautiful athlete okay so now let's go ahead and drill this with a golf ball go ahead and set up to that golf ball okay and what I want you to do TJ is we're just going to hover the club so it's above the ball okay okay now again the stick is only going to move because this starts going laterally and this all responds to this okay boom there you go just keep waving it waving it and whenever you want you can go ahead and spiral load it to the top and hit it meant interesting too how like this see how calm this is up here so we see all these really good players that this area looks like it's calm okay now not everybody on tour looks like that but yeah a lot of our favorites look like that like the golf club has time to just like cruise up here and float and then it goes the reason that that's happening is from right here at P 2.5 I have anterior Trail and posterior lead arm lines unloaded so now I need time to load them so now as the arms bounce up they're starting to load as I drop and go the other way I finish the load got it well I see it well it floats in here sure now if I loaded the lead arm line early set wants to bounce off ain't no chance to float we do that so what's cool is that like you can even test this at home too if you just fire this across this lead arm line and try to keep it up here you won't be able to see it bounce um because that's the rubber band right it's rubber band yeah with that and just try to keep it there just as best you can just try to keep it up there see it bounce it just can't help it yeah okay so there's no flow whoa there you go so now if you're going here hello okay as I'm going here so I could float it up here to the top yep so that's lateral then spiral then arms is what's happening lateral spiral wound there go the arm second just I can place it here so there's the sequencing for faults that's the sequence lateral spiral arms yep and a lot of players that we coach we talk about feeling like you can place it here as you're dropping and moving and and dropping back in here oh boom so now you're dropped back in now you've loaded these in our preferred pattern now hit it with everything wash it out okay let's throw that that drill again just feeling like this is what's leading the club's responding both ways like this is trying to get away from this boom boom whatever you want to spiral and you can see like with TJ God that was so good how much time he has here to load because as the golf club is floating up here he can drop re-center the ribs all the things that we want to do in that space you have time to do it and now you'll feel at you'll feel passively passive load here meaning you're not actively trying to move anything you're not actively trying to load the arm like this is an active arm load because I'm actively moving my arm compared to my arms here if I just dropped and turned that's a passive arm load okay so I think that's a pretty good place to just kind of stop and like have everybody chew on that but it's really again if you can think of I want good rhythm where good Rhythm comes from is proper sequencing gotta understand the sequence yeah exactly in the sequence just in the simplest terms is how does the spiral line interact with the arm line what's loading what's passively loading what's actively loading so if I know that then I'm I'm really starting to get there and then finally Muscle fascia human beings we move Best In Waves rather than lightning bolts okay if you can do all those things gosh you're golf swing golf swing is going to just start just generally feeling nice feeling good covered a lot in that ask questions we'll get back to you booming\n",
      "you'll see how the pelvis and space moves this way yeah kind of that like 45 degree space exactly so it moved into depth because all that it did is drop it's not because I'm just shoving my booty back yeah it's not a hinge right and I'm not just sliding my butt down a wall I'm just dropping like if I were just going to fall into a seat [Music] here we go we're out in sunny beautiful AZ it's sunny it's sunny it's sunny dude it's like 1 15 today 40 humidity welcome to the oven well welcome to the show yeah out here with Alex Trevino one of our awesome awesome coaches in AZ you've probably seen uh seen him on our Instagram he he throws up some awesome posts go to his page as well what's your uh Alex J Trevino Alex J Trevino so if you want to check out Alex and more of his stuff then definitely follow him uh on his instant but um really pumped to get rocking with you dude yeah we've been talking about this for a little while but what do we want to talk about today homie yeah I think the biggest thing that has my eye is the pelvis because you hear tons of things with the pelvis what's it do what's it not do how does it work that's going to be an awesome awesome video for us today let's uh let's start this off I know you're cold just hit one for us yeah if you could yeah let me put a glove on so glove up toss this thing a country mile yeah baby let's send cool so we're just going stock out seven iron right here awesome so reason I want you just to hit one other than just showing off your freaking awesome move uh is I'd love you to just as the athlete more or less explain kind of what you're sensing in your action when it comes to like the middle of you yeah right what's going on in the pelvis and the hips yeah for sure so to me the pelvis is responding to what the upper is doing and then in transition I feel pressure moving lead side but as well as more in the heels okay and then from there I feel it opening and getting around to the left yes that's awesome so what's interesting like in golf instruction is these phrases or terms or feels or anatomical phrases even that guys toss out are just incorrect and so when somebody goes hip rotation for instance hip rotation what we're actually trying to articulate is pelvic rotation yeah we're turning yeah what's the pelvis hip rotation is this stuff this is hip rotation yeah like when you're doing those hip circles in the morning stretch exactly exactly so hip rotation is just a joint yeah right you got the femur that sticks up into the pelvis and that's bang so how it's rotating in here that's all hip rotation when we're looking at the golf swing what we're really seeing in the middle is pelvic rotation yes yes yes exactly which is really really important to see and the system that we love talking about just from like a Global Perspective is this idea of flexion rotation whenever we're saying flexion we're talking about the angle that the femur and the and the spine really have with one another and obviously the pelvis as well but that would be pelvic or hip excuse me hip flexion the rotation comes from like the spirals in the chest and how we're moving the ribs around blah blah so when looking at like how we're moving the pelvis and why it moves in space we often talk about either like active or passive movement or activity so what you just explained is beautiful Alex because you're talking about an active movement coming from like the upper spiral or the chest or the ribs or the thoracic region and then the pelvis responds to that so if you go in here and set up again for us dude yeah and show us that same like move up into P4 so you'll notice how if we just trace this right hip socket yeah it worked towards me yes right yes it's working in this space here yes okay great so if you set up again what we'll sometimes see that's that's inappropriate go ahead and start actively rotating the pelvis there you go okay so what that does is it slacks out the spirals and it whacks out the whole system yeah and Kyle our awesome strength and conditioning coordinator down here talks about dissociation with a lot of our athletes what's dissociation by the way yeah dissociation is whether if you're focusing upper or lower but one of them is moving while the other one is essentially being stable so that's where they are disassociating whether it's upper to lower or lower to Upper you've got to feeling that stretch yeah exactly so we've got dissociating the pelvis or we've got dissociating the rib correct right so it's super important because we'll see a lot of people because of this like inappropriate map in their mind because they're trying to have with all the information that we throw out there we want to see this is the main engine and the arms almost respond to that but people will cheat right kind of that fake turn they go oh it's getting open but like a big thing I'll pick up especially in the virtual space is you know in general in golf depth depth depth got to get it so they go okay but now this guy locked out and this actually stalls rotation so now it's Earth with the arms and they go why am I all whacked out yeah it just feels like massively inappropriate right I mean it's cool because they're trying to do something but that's again we just throw out this term like depth yeah how okay well you can get deep with a lot of different things you can throw your hands back there they're deep you could rotate the chest it can get deep you could rotate the pelvis depth depth depth it's just a false it's like just a word that doesn't really course it's got to be better to find like what exactly in depth are we looking for at least in our realm because it's different for everybody that's such a good point so like kind of going down this Rabbit Hole the pelvis the only active thing we're looking for the pelvis to do within our system is to drop so we're moving into hip flexion and the importance of Drop Like if you go in here again and set up for a student and don't even show a backswing just go ahead and show drop you'll see how the pelvis in space moves this way yeah kind of that like 45 degree space exactly so it moved into depth because all that it did is drop it's not because I'm just shoving my booty back yeah it's not a hinge right and I'm not just sliding my butt down a wall I'm just dropping like if I were just going to fall into a seat yes right that's all it is so it's not this like massively complex thing but we see it lower obviously and work away from this space where the golf ball is to me so if I'm dropping I'm moving the pelvis away from this space yes massively important that also pairs really well with the spiral line and how the spiral is working up back and Away into this space as well it's working away from you yeah so you could think of the golf swing like super simple in that the spiral leads so if you go ahead and show that good there's the upper spiral now we would drop good and now we're going to spiral out into finish that's the main engine but you have to be aware of it right and that's what creates this awesome opportunity for proper depth yes active rotator active dropper also in regards to the pelvis let's talk about the femur so this is leg action so we'll go back into hip rotation yeah so if we follow the spiral line and I'm pulling this upper spiral upper spiral up a spiral what's actually happening and this is trippy this knee is pointing on this angle so this is 90 degrees is a little bit more over here and as I turn the upper spiral it pulls on the pelvis eventually and now this kneecap the patella is pointing out this direction so it looks like it's internal rotation yeah but it's not because the pelvis like the the difference between how far like where my pelvis is pointing like perpendicular yeah here to the kneecap as I turn turn turn turn turn look at how much more this has moved like this space is black external yeah they didn't follow each other proportionally exactly this one moved external this one moved internal because of the active rotation well it's passive rotation in the pelvis but the pelvis rotated and so the legs respond to that yeah but what's really important here and you just brought this up which is a really really key piece is we we love this idea of people being able to rotate through the strike meaning the chest is rotating well we're rotating through the strike so that means from like this P5 ish phase all the way through P9 we're rotating but until I get to P5 I'm not I need to stay in this space over here and so if we follow the spiral line like just in in Gate patterns you can do this with me Alex yeah so if we just take a step towards the camera here okay with yep we'll go boom with this left foot okay this spiral that goes underneath this this like lead armpit for us is going to start to pull pull pull pull pull and that's what's dragging this hip socket towards the target to drag the foot there you go and so that spiral the lower Spiral goes down the IT band which is the outer portion of your leg and so as you're pulling pulling pulling pulling pulling eventually there goes the heel see how this heel gets spun away yeah that direction Yeah the more I pull the more it would the more it spins exactly now let's go back here again okay step with the other foot boom okay now from there as you start to pull pull pull pull see where that heel got tossed yeah gets tossed away okay so remember that thought yeah okay go back go to like neutral address for uh for golf posture so start pulling pulling pulling pulling okay where's that heel gonna get tossed I keep going it's going to want to there's some point good and so now as you re-center boom into P5 see how you're still in this space yeah so the femur what's going on here is it is moved into a space where it's working external but it tosses the heel away but the shape that the femur is in right here we're not going to actively start to rotate this away that's a big thing I see everyone's huge thing Sneed drill right we'll drop the bucket yeah well that is an active dual external action with the femers which is like an extremely weak you slack out the spiral line the whole bit just goes the pot yeah it's hard to turn with these guys won't turn whether it's passive or active and it's like exactly so yeah like a lot like tiger zolte didn't activate my glutes and everybody makes fun of them for it well he's extremely correct but what he's really talking about is the spiral line which goes down glute Mead and kind of into like comes back up into glute Max actually and up through you so like your glute like the whole complex is part of the freaking spiral line yeah you got to use them exactly so as soon as you do this you slack out the spiral line no more glutes so what do I end up doing extend throw blah blah blah just as a wax system yeah it's kind of like there's matchups with the body and it's like I think it's like glute ABS or like hamstrings back exactly the hamstrings back is more like the extension glute core is more of that flexion and allows you to rotate even like you're saying if it gets slacked out yep this shuts off or doesn't activate so then it's like okay this is all I have left yeah and you're talking about like front chain compared to back chain dominance right that we want to be in back chain for as long as we possibly can because we're stake we stay dropped in we stay active into the spiral okay so the purpose of this exercise is to look at all right I'm here I'm here I'm here there goes the heel as I plant there's the re-center because my my rib system we call it rib sway we're dropping here at the same time boom I'm back into the space where I'm into the lead side but this femur shape the rotation that it has here has been external for a heck of a lot of time because of the shape of the Spiral as I drop in and now I bounce into the other spiral now I'm working into internal rotation you're turning into that femur correct yes so the pelvis because the upper spiral is pulling it is now being rotated into this femur space yeah so if you do that like Folks at home you do this you'll feel your whole rump you're lighting up load like a mother in an appropriate way where it's like oh I didn't do this before it's like super duper stable yeah like people will have that response which is like massively important we have to have that especially if we're looking to hit something like if I'm looking to hit something hard here I can't just slack out the spiral because of just tossing this inappropriately external I got nothing yeah so that's why people extend because at least I can like shoot energy this way whereas if I'm here boom that can turn and hit so like if we just follow spirals or second Global law you'll start to see that the heels the only thing that they do is they get tossed away yeah that alone that picture alone automatically affects the pelvis and we hear it a lot from a lot of the players that come in and we're lucky enough to work with them where they go I want a more rotational golf swing well you need to Define where the rotation is coming from what's that mean the rotations in here you guys have some nuggets to chew on baby that was awesome that was awesome work your pelvis really well understanding what it does actively understanding what it does passively how the legs how the feet fit into that system great Maps Great Wraps [Music]\n",
      "boom so if we're in elevation this is in depression now go depression elevation there you go so now from here heavy hit protract see ya [Music] I'm gonna talk about scarcity okay I like your shirt I like your shirt that's a new one how many comments do you think we're going to get on our shirts on this one yeah a lot of varied comments for sure some people really like them some people not not a fan but I know one thing for sure though everybody's gonna like my blue pants I know that oh okay all right dude we're uh we're talking about something that I'm like fascinated with right now uh in this video we're going to talk about the scapscapula so this posterior view scapula is right here it's this big like Wing you can feel like that blade right here that's part of the scapula what's so cool about the scap is it is a bone that is directly tied in to the spiral line so the spiral on its Journey down if you go posterior again teach spiral starts right up here in TJ's Noggin kind of right in this area goes down the sign of a c-spine and it goes down and over the top on his journey down and under it goes over this this Gap the scap can do more than this but four main movements okay so if we're in the gym and we're doing shoulder shrugs this exercise that's what's called scap elevation okay scap depression would be the opposite way where the scaps are going down the shoulders are going down gotcha okay we can protract them which is like think of it like big bear hug mode if you hug a bear you go this way that's protraction and then retraction is like rhomboid pulling the gym this way okay so those wings the scaps get closer together that way okay so there's just a lot of information sure okay so then it's like okay what do we prefer to see and what do we often see okay okay so arms up for us and some of this for those of you that watch a lot of our content this is going to be some review but if you lead arm adduct you will load the lead posterior complex got it what that really is is scapula protraction hmm so that action leaks into the scap the scap is protracting meaning it's that's bear hug mode again so that's dual adduction if we bear hug right okay protraction of the scaps okay anytime you Pro protract a scap you are loading the posterior arm line of either the lead or the trail okay so protraction on either side I'm loading up my back you're loading up back yep my posterior your back armling exactly exactly okay when we're getting ready to start the golf swing what do we see most players do to start their swing exactly so they lead arm adduct got it which loads the posterior line protraction of the scap okay so all that gets loaded real early that's really early and loaded fascial lines want to unload unload exactly so if we're loading this complex early in the backswing and for us our definition of backswing is like from P1 to like Max P3 and then we have transition which is from P3 to P5 so if we load from P1 to P3 where we're going to probably unload P3 to P5 it wants to unload there unless I do something artificial and just hold this back like both are just going to make the golf swing feel whacked out because then through the strike it's kind of wacky okay so instead what we need to do is let's figure out how we're moving the scaps throughout the entirety of of the golf swing okay so we're just going to show the uh boat drill here but let's Show Boat drill improperly so this is going to be L spine stuff so nothing is going on in the scaps we're just going to move this way okay so we see this a lot see how it kicks out TJ's pelvis it's all on the L spine the scaps aren't really moving here meaning if I'm right here and I'm just moving this yeah the scap complex isn't moving all the like pivot is in the start of the L spline like lower T right can be fairly unhealthy okay so let's remember elevation depression protraction retraction okay so hold that right up against your your shoulder complex okay okay I want you to depress the trail scap there you go do that again good now protract the trails Gap there you go so what you can do that's really really cool to learn this and learn like what we love to see in the boat exercise is you can just hold either a PVC pipe or a golf club right off your Trail side and just move it in a circular manner so how there you go and just do it instead of both shoulder complexes moving see how right here I can just move just the trail there you go good good now you'll feel it playing here see how playful the shoulder complex gets yep that's it yep okay so what you're really educating is the uh like almost the uppermost spiral so if I am working up the spiral line going from lead hip complex underneath the trail armpit and over the trail scap to move that I'm going to have this the the scap it is going to respond in elevation it's elevated there now I didn't go here going scalp elevation no but as I'm as I'm rotating using the upper spiral the trail scap is elevated sure now in transition we prefer to see a golf club that goes from a slightly above the plane to under the plane the way that we do that through that little bow drill there you go see that boat drill but the boat drill is really through scap movement proper scat movement sure and when you're doing that teach go ahead and set up for uh posterior view with that right across your uh right across your shoulder complexes good if we're doing this well you should feel a lot of the movement right in here in the spine there you go this is so much scap see the spine moves here for teach because this Gap is depressing protracting good now it would elevate a bit retract depressed protracts see that movement it's all on the shoulder and freeze there's the bin that we like to see it's all on the tee okay so if we want the bin to be here more up like the further up we can get the bends the healthier the movement is because like T and C spine is like meant to move or vertebrates we're meant to bend rotate do all this crazy stuff that's t-spine and c-spine and the higher we can get with that you're just preventing preventing injury the healthier it is the higher you feel it right yeah exactly we just feel it all happen here feeling it in the scaps is a way to move those bends up into the t-spine as opposed to feeling it down here in your L spine yep exactly so for teaching folks like actual scat movement what's going to go on throughout the entirety of like the backswing transition and through the hit if we're looking at the trail scap first the trail scap will elevate depress in transition and protract through the head got you okay can you show that yep absolutely so as you're turning it elevates now it would just depress there you go now would protract to go through the hip there you go there's the hit yes yes it kind of feels powerful too like it feels good exactly like if you go this way that action right there is like super powerful you can feel like the the the load now is late in transition because this retract like the scap is going to depress it's also going to retract because I'm turning away from it so now this like my trail scap is retracted right here so I've loaded up anterior line so you've turned your sternum or gotten your sternum further away from this Gap it's moving here right this is moving away from it yep and that loads up that that'd be anterior side of Trail complex Trail complex just by turning this way as you're yep and what's really really important here too is I am not actively motoring the scap into retraction so I'm not doing this action this is scap retraction based on on the trail arm yep right I'm loading it because I've dropped and I'm rotating here see I'm rotating my chest away yeah that that makes the scap retract but they're two different pictures in my mind sure one is it boom the picture is not to go here pictures to go there exactly so now you scap attracted but this stuck feel is people from here they're actively Trail or Trail scapula retracting and that pulls the handle in the golf club underneath the plane you see that a lot so yeah if we're here in a fairly good backswing position but then I actively scap or tract except pulls the Hub or the handle too far back so right now it has nowhere to move now you don't got room to do this what do you call this Feel Again well that's protraction yeah okay if it gets stuck back here you can't protract as much right you can but where the energy is going to flow is out this way too far to the right so that's where you see that bro I just ripped ass that's okay so so that's where you see that club head kicking out this way with rapid face rotation it's more the handle that we see kicking out to the right but yes but the face rotates really hard there you go I got you yeah yep because if we get stuck in here exactly because I've actively retracted this Gap when we're just calling it active because the arm I'm actively moving exactly active Yep this would be passive yep exactly exactly so the nice thing is about proper Movement we want this we've talked about this before but this Trail elbow we wanted to have clear Passage through here so me dropping creates that that room for that to happen but also if I drop and then move my chest away from that see how this arm didn't move in space I'm not actively retracting this is stuck somebody goes I feel stuck it's because this this Trail elbow moves into the posterior side it's behind me rather than right now it's anterior dropping if I turn a bit it's still anterior yeah if I depress oh that gets under the plane properly protracting makes me hit yep yeah that's a different picture that's a different picture yeah a lot of people have that picture when they're trying to get the center of mass behind it this way yep exactly and they're trying to do this so and we're talking mostly about the trails Gap I mean the the lead scap almost moves just in opposition of it right like if I have elevated in the backswing my my Trails Gap the lead scap is going to depress that's what creates lead lateral Bend gotcha so if any time that I depress my scalp if I just depress one of them I'm in trail Bend Trail lateral Bend if I depress my lead I'm in lead lateral Bend but again the bend comes in the spine so if I'm up here my leads Gap is in depression my trail scap is an elevation that's what creates the bend and the t-spine well now we talk about bouncing spirals a lot scap elevation scap depression boom it's really bouncing between those scat movements a little bit movements yeah we're not really bouncing spirals are but we're bouncing scapula movement boom so if we're in elevation this is in depression now go depression elevation there you go so now from here heavy hit protract see ya excellent yeah so just hit a little pitchy one here sure and what I want you to manage is the elevation depression and protraction here okay this move right here where you're feeling this hole right shoulder complex moving the instrument in space there you go very cool because now what's what's really nice about the scaps just from a movement perspective is we can see where the tool wants to move in space elevation makes it move up depression makes it go down yep so now I'm above the plane under the plane got you yep and then I can hit sort of moving the instrument and space really well boom beautiful and there's the hit good and then just kind of wrapping this up with anterior versus posterior arm line loads in the back swing go ahead and set up so we can see anterior side okay what we're looking to do early in the backswing okay is load the posterior Trail arm line and the anterior lead arm line yep okay so let's let's have you move I'm going to keep the handle right here but move this pack what feels like underneath the trail humerus there you go good so what's happened is this is stretched out this area is stretched out that would be loaded anytime we're stretching fascia we're loading fascia this is stretched as well this is loaded so in essence go back to neutral we're looking to move this keep this Trail arm right where it's at underneath so I'm pulling this under under yeah okay as it keeps going it'll make the make the arm lines eventually move good if you really wanted to look cool just load the hand complex Trail hand complex there you go so now we've got posterior Trail armline loaded anterior lead arm line loaded what slacked is the posterior lead arm and anterior Trail arm now if you put enough energy in that the arms would bounce up and as they're bouncing up you drop and start to rotate the ribs the other way there you go so now from here now we've bounced loads now we have anterior Trail loaded and posterior lead loaded right so if those are loaded now you can hit through the strike bam and there's the protraction field that we've we've talked about with the trail arm good good yeah so there's a couple of different ways to really work on the scaps you can work on them like what we just did with loads and most people I think feel the posterior Trail load early in the backswing so riding yep so they'll feel load right back here okay then as they sling this arm off meaning like a good picture is the rib complex knocking this Trail humorous out of there so if I'm set up here I have some kind of gapping here between the right ribs like where my armpit is and this trail trail arm I'm just moving into that space to knock it out of there yeah boom so when you're talking like moving into the trail humorous that's what you're talking about so humerus right here you're moving your spiral line essentially into that yes exactly beautiful it loads up that posterior swings the arms up at which point passively you get your sternum away from the club head it's going to load up the other side now you've loaded anterior yes so like what you just did show that position in one motion so we're going to knock the right out fall back in here there you go do it again just smooth it out boom now smooth it out so it's bounce float good so now you're ready to hit boom so you just you just manage the load phase so it makes the hit easier now I can just boom boom boom boom makes it real smooth right down there makes it really easy okay so show us one where you're just feeling the load that same load where you're knocking that trail humerus out towards the camera based on that post that's beautiful and as it floats you're going to load anterior there you go really floaty here bounce float beautiful a little extra oomph on that one yep that one had different load on it for sure that's excellent okay so scap stuff's pretty cool it's really interesting um again shoulder complex is fairly fairly complex area to feel some of this stuff but instead of just focusing spirals instead of just focusing on where the arms are motoring if we're finding kind of a a neutral middle ground for both the arms and body movement which we call spirals sure that's kind of the scap complex so yeah if we're focusing on what's going on in this Gap it can really marry what's going on in the arms and the body like a super super high level there you go scaps baby flush them out [Music]\n",
      "hold this just like that okay okay now spiral the golf club look at it [Music] play what up dog what's going on so I'm here with the coolest cat around Mr Jackson warry one of our awesome coaches in Colorado so what do you want to talk about today dude talk about a little bit about kind of Center Mass how we can control it other than just with our arms and hands but also how these guys our ribs can do most of the work all them ribs and when you're talking about Center mask cuz there's like I can have the center MK of my pointer finger Center MK of my bicep ribs like what Center Mass are you talking about we're controling Center Mass the golfing club perfect and those of you that are like what the heck is that I think the easiest way to to really figure it out is just hold it like that kind of the balance point of the golf club every club right so Center mass of the club and you're saying how you motor it instead of doing it mostly with the hands and arms MH you're talking about the ribs mhm what the heck are you saying how do we move it with the ribs well get a little bit of action of kind of that rib sway rotation sure um this is the engine anyways so the shapes that I make from here should be able to follow with the club beautiful so your action let me I'll trade you ball for a Club go ahead and just show off that moveie yours man just go ahead and hit one into the screen there for us yeah beautiful okay so in your mind's eye when you're talking about the center mass of the club can you just show me where you're trying to motor it throughout the entirety of your swing yeah so first thing kind of from setup if I kind of break it down I'm thinking ribs are going first and as I'm spiraling up uhuh I want this feeling like it gets vertical okay um now obviously it's not going to look that way right for me sure as I now start to transition change direction I just feel ribs are taking everything this way okay keeping everything there okay I don't feel it as much dropping with the hands gotcha it's just letting my body be the engine super just react to it yep and when you're saying body being the engine we're kind of talking about the ribs in that instance correct yes okay cool so trade you back okay this is kind of a fun little exercise and uh we'll throw uh credit where credit should be due this was taught to me by Luke bracky okay so one of our favorites we just hold the go a medicine ball just like this elbows are straight out and what we're looking to do is move the axis of the elbows meaning if I put a line through my lead elbow and a line through my trail elbow we're looking to move this ball we call call it spiral baring the ball in this fashion right here so just show me that beautiful now as Jackson's doing this what's really cool you'll see from a face on perspective lead elbow lowers then it'll heighten lower heighten and it's trading lead elbow Trail elbow and this is an under pattern it's very similar to our boat drill with the PVC pipe but if you do that from down the line go ahead and show the exact same thing you'll see how this elbow in space okay go to neutral for me okay now slow motion start spiraling see the direction that the elbow is moving in space now it goes down back forward now it'll rise and then it comes back out again just keep doing the same exact exercise so see where this is moving in space it's almost like he's making this like Circle in space in this way and it's primarily done with what my ribs rib baby yeah so you're not cheating and showing like bunch of crazy like arm stuff yeah exactly or like moving the ball around with your hands no all done with the ribs Y which is freaking sexy it feels good you're pretty sexy dude okay so let's look let's look at this like in a different perspective as well because what you were talking about is how we motor the center of mass of the club like if this is a golf club Center Mass is down here yep go ahead and set up with that ball again okay and let's do it from face on I think it'll be easier to see this PVC pipe is kind of indicative of Jackson's midline see it's vertical right now the ax of his of his elbows would look just like this so in essence go ahead and start moving see see the difference in how steep that just got okay now show right here just you spiraling that ball go back to neutral forming okay slow motion start spiraling the ball that's now perpendicular to where Jack Jackson's elbows are now go the other way look at where the center Mass just went it fell so this whole idea of shallowing you can shallow it like six ways to Sunday like there's a ton of different ways to do it but if we are breaking the structure of how we set up with the golf club like structure the the golf club my hands and my arms if I'm breaking that it's really difficult to recover it super hard now you got to use all your hands exactly so do me a favor here let's see what this looks like I'm just general and to be honest like ja Jackson's like he's one of our best movement coaches really best sacrum move in the academy when it comes to to to just general movement and all all the coaches that we have absolutely okay so when he does this like you'll see his his play in the ribs and what it does to affect the center of mass so again you're not doing anything show show cheating just with the hands okay so we're not Gary Sheffield here no okay instead we're going to go Barry Bonds do this in slowmo boom great now go ahead and start changing in Direction and just keep it moving but do it in slow motion and you'll see how the center of mass The Hub which is the point right where his hands connect all is playing but the the shaft of the golf club is always perpendicular go ahead and go back to neutral for me is always perpendicular to this see how the shaft and the axis of his elbows if you start slowmo moving stays perpendicular yep okay keep moving oh look how cool that is it's just all done in the ribs all done in the ribs all done in the ribs which is great and that's the main shallower so go ahead and set up for us again gra ball here great and if you can Jackson just show us one to the top just a P4 position great see how tall the shaft is there go ahead and set up again let's actually just go to P3 which is kind of our idea of what the end of the back swing would be so P3 lead arm is level now as you bounce so right now heavy lead lateral Bend M okay as you bounce from P3 up through P4 to P5 go ahead and show that same same shape with the ribs there you go look at the difference and now how how leveled out the center mass of the golf club went behind you primarily because now you traded you're in trail lateral Bend instead of lead lateral so stay right there if you just turn to set the golf go behind the ball boom there's impact and it's Square that's so cool okay so let's do this go ahead and hit us one with this same idea of spiral in the ribs spiral in the golf club spiral in the medicine ball however you want to term it that's the that's the picture in your mind okay but kind of a slowmo one and what we'll do is for for folks to see this we'll just slow you down and show how you're moving in that transitional period from like P3 to P5 but nice amount of play in those ribs as you're doing that beautiful let's go ahead and just tap one in there you get six iron hit six iron like 140 beautiful so so cool stable stable and what's nice like when people go like generally Athletics mhm it's like a stupid term sometimes right right show me an athletic golf swing you're like what the heck does that mean yeah you're like I guess Athletics is just like one it's Dynamic and two it's like super sensory like the picture that I have in my mind like right there you have a picture of like what you're doing in here to motor the ball motor the golf club motor your elbows whatever it is it's yours but it's sensory you have a picture in your mind exactly and you can feel it you sense it the feel of it right what are my ribs doing in space to motor that around and you just get heightened and it should like especially for good athletes like you you make that golf swing you should immediately go like oh dude that feels so good so good feels nice oh yes right feels very nice feels very nice exactly okay so let's show a couple of exercises to and I don't even know if you know this one uh Jackson but have we ever talked about the figure8 drill this exercise I'll just show you this so again if we have if we have this here this is just generally uh like boat drill for us if you were holding on to the medicine ball we'd be right here so it looks very similar if I had the golf club down here and I'm starting to motor the club in essence the center mass of the club is making the shape of a figure a okay so we can feel like where the golf club's exiting how it's transitioning how it exit over here how it transition in the other side so we're just making this movement and then eventually once you feel it w hit show us one of those from really nice setup and then from there hover and in your mind you're just making there you go so you're motoring the center mass of the club the only thing that I'd like to see go right in here and freeze good so the center of mass now is is going to exit and because of the ribs control the center Mass Field Loop here yep to go there there's the loop here now it's exit Loop feel where it's at yep up keep it going now yeah so you're motoring the center of mass around in space primarily again from the ribs once you feel that feel free to go ahead and just chip one into the screen cool so now like was that heavy thin perfect what was that heavy yep so let's just move the center M uh of the ribs forward to control where the bottom out is a bit just move the bottom out forward same [Music] exercise beautiful shapes beautiful so kind of a fun drill yeah CU again Athletics it's Dynamic it's moving it's playful but also that sensory aspect where yeah there's that it's not even just here it's like I can feel we of the club all the way around so now it becomes this like really holistic experience M the super holistic experience is like you can feel what the strike is like before you even hit it so it's like yeah I've got result because I'm flushing out the ball I feel where the club is I know what my body's doing to support that it's just like that's why I think uh tour players have a really difficult time describing what their experienc in their golf swing like if you go hey Justin Rose or Rory or DJ like they'll feel different what do you feel in you're swing and they're like they can't like get it out because it's so big it's this huge holistic thing that they're again it's they're sensing it's really difficult to articulate it's it's extremely difficult I mean I struggle so much just describing it to the kids what I feel because it's like I feel completely different than and it's exactly like you said and I think that's our job right is to like identify that person how how do I put myself in them what are they thinking what are they seeing what are they feeling so that now I can have the experience because I'm in you in a way and go okay boom this is what we need to do different rabbit hole but these exercises are really really good ones for understanding the ribs role yes and how it Motors the center of masses around cuz the ribs what we feel in here can be a play a massive role in in t-spine Bend this lateral Bend right there's rotation in that cuz obviously the ribs are like massively involved with rotation and we just talked about it here like pushing the divot forward is all because of lateral movement in the center and mass of the ribs oh and that's really what the ribs do is they do those three things lateral then we have lateral Bend and rotation if you're able to manage that man it's so much easier to motor the golf oh so easy okay perfect okay last thing um to make this like a really fun holistic experience just drill wise let's see three shots and we'll just call them your ones twos and threes so and that's just energy level if I've got this medicine ball here and I'm moving it at a one it's passive y two is more energy in the ribs and three is like big waves Big W big wave and that's going to also leak into the golf club okay okay so let's do some figure rates above it what feels like a one and then you can set up to the ball and show what a one feels like from from actual setup okay okay boom now we're hover one a super passive feel that energy good now go ahead and set up to the ball go one beautiful didn't manage divot okay yeah it was kind of fun again slightly heavy so we can just move the divot forward div forward okay show me a uh hover figure eight drill again two beautiful excellent go ahead and set up to it okay let's move the divot forward same energy two beautiful that was freaking good see how easy that is too it's like so easy just move the freaking divot forward big deal it out now show Big Wave three beautiful okay let's go ahead and set up same figure eight three beautiful and you got to be able to do that if you're going to play golf at a high level oh yeah manage energy manage how far you throw it manage trajectory it does all that stuff oh and i' see it so much in the wedges too it's I used to be this pop it up yep not going anywhere rip it back now it's that's a really good point too because now you can feel the same like a motor in the center of mass because of the ribs but now I can really control the ball and wedges might feel like they're ones mid irons are kind of twos drivers three mhm but it's the same system just with different energies you can and your ball at that super high level and you're moving the instrument as it's designed very efficiently very efficient okay ribs move the center of mass based on how you're moving the ribs super fun Jackson wary ladies and gentlemen flush them out it's been a pleasure\n",
      "and let's see a pieced out uh progressional sequence movement exercise where we're feeling lateral to start now we're going to turn good now we'd go drop and Sway and now from there you just turn but where's that that sacrum going as you work all the way into finish beautiful that's [Music] excellent what up what up dude Target's this way te yep we got the camera over here today mhm wh why why little face on view I think I mean all of our videos are basically down the line so a lot of requests on seeing what these moves look like from a face on perspective I think it will help us shed a little bit more light on what's going on with the rib and pelvis structures and where those are moving in space yep before we like really get into the depths let's go surface level first okay we got rib system so rib system would be from uh bottom of ribs to the top of the hat and then we've got pelvic system which is from the bottom of the ribs to the tops of the kneecaps those are the two main systems that we're looking at when we're talking about the body okay the the rib system is in charge of three variables three movements mhm there's lateral movement so towards the Target and away from it like on a Clos line yep yep you're showcasing rib sway that's a JT Thomas ISM you don't follow him go follow him on Instagram um rotation there you go so purely just rotating around the axis of the spine generally MH okay and then finally we have lateral bends now what you just showed with the lateral movement you are also showing lateral Bend as well so go ahead and show us just lateral sway this way with the with the um ribs beautiful and what most people do um is do this improperly TJ's doing it great he moves moved the center mass of his ribs towards the Target and went into Trail Bend so they went in opposition most people when they get when they get in trouble go back to neutral they'll go lateral Bend and bounce into this side so now the center of mass of TJ's Ribs went away from the Target and he bounced into lateral Bend into his Trail side as well so they both went in the same direction right we need him going in opposition if you're going that way with the center of mass you should be going into Trail Bend if you're going this way with the center of mass you're going into lead Bend so rib sway is cool because in essence you're knocking out two birds with one stone lateral movement and lateral Bend and lateral Bend cool but again just in review ribs rotation mhm lateral Bend lateral movement got it Center of mass okay the pelvis actively is in charge of one thing it actively does one thing in the golf swing drops drops okay so I'm not saying that it doesn't rotate I I'm just saying that it is rotating passively because the upper is commanding it to so because the upper spiral is rotating that forces the pelvis to go into rotation as well exactly we're just not looking for a dominant rotation in the pelvis 100% yeah so like most players will get to the top and if they go rotate from here well number one what am I rotating I could rotate the femur that would be external I could rotate the pelvis I could rotate my chest I could rotate numerous different systems that's where people get confused a little bit right turn what what do I turn yeah exactly all right te so let let's showcase um without a golf club you can use that stick to go ahead and hug okay um and just in general like the sequence of movement like what we're doing is really really important so main stuff we need laterals and we need rotation out of the chest got it always always always always we're getting laterals done prior to the rotation interesting okay so let's move this clo line if you will this shaft right at me got the lateral done now go ahead and turn beautiful now we're going to get the lateral done again see where this this Clos line again is appearing let's get the Clos line moving this way laterally first good now you can turn so what's nice you've moved in in a in a few different ways that's really really important especially the transitional phase go ahead and go into the back swing again lateral turn so right now if we had a pressure mat a lot of pressure is kind of right in the arch of the trail foot for sure probably 70 30ish okay as you laterally move like right now we're in lead lateral Bend so as you Sway and work the lateral first here you'll notice and you'll feel this athletically that you traded from the arch of the trail foot into the ball of the foot or even the toes of the Le like I don't know 60 40ish roughly but now You' got yourself in lateral Bend in the trail side you haven't rotated yet not yet which is great but now if we want to turn we got the pressure in this lead foot and now I can go perpendicular this way as you start to turn and curve there you go where do you feel the pressure really go that way yes and that's almost what you're showing right now this position is really close to impact it might be just barely posted impact but you've gone from in transition kind of what would have been P5 mhm into the there you go that would be roughly delivery so the golf club would be back in here in space and now as you start to turn turn turn turn turn turn the golf club would look like it's in here and you've gone all the way from like somewhat into the toes definitely in the balls of your foot all the way into like the outermost yeah yep that's all rotation and turn from these lead joints curving out of there uhhuh so what's happening down here in the foot complex is really driven by what we're doing in the upper spiral exactly okay when we're kind of going into this even deeper like the sequence of this movement let's go ahead and set up again with your clothes line the whole look here is lateral good maintain the flexion now turn and maintain the flexion there's number two now we would drop good drop with the rib sway there you go now we're in delivery and from there you're just going to keep turning the chest you've already gone lateral enough we're going to keep turning turning turning turning turning all the way up into the Finish beautiful that little exercise right there just like freezing them out is a great way to like really start to feel what moves really are are are happening and the sequence of movement the hardest thing yeah go ahead and as people get better at the the spacing them out the freezing them out they can start to blend those movements together right yeah and just well and I think even maybe uh cuz blending sounds like they all happen at once which they they don't right there's still a sequence but we're just buffing off the transitional areas of each movement so it's a smooth transition in between each movement instead of lateral Rotation by no means are we saying it's position position position right it's it all flows in between yep exactly which we need to have the only thing that's that's difficult is transition because we have the lateral movement of the ribs yep and the drop of the pelvis happening at the same time same time so have two simple movements like this is not that complex no this is not complex nope right but when they happen together it's like rubbing the top of your head and your stomach in opposite directions at the same time each Act is simple yeah but you've got to be able to manage the drop and the lateral movement of the ribs definitely yep yep so um in doing this let's hit a couple of shots here I think this would be a nice way to go ahead and start blending this let's hit a couple of shots like a 100 yards out there okay TJ's got six iron and typically you hit 6 iron 200 yards or so about that y okay and with a club let's see the freezer first okay so let's go lateral first good wonderful and this was a test for you actually notice how the grip and the club head didn't move MH okay you moved the ribs into this Trail humorous the golf club isn't firing off over here beautiful now as you turn excellent now the golf club starts to go ahead and work back and TJ does this really well as well see how he Leverage The Golf Club there's certain amount of extension some amount of pronation little bit of radio like just to get the golf club leveraged here and if you wanted the lead arm to lift as well just to get to the top you're more than welcome to do that beautiful now from there we would see drop and the lateral movement of the ribs going this way there's there's beautiful transition now we would just turn all the way up into finish while letting the golf club unload beautiful let's see that again just in freezers so we got one two 3 4 beautiful that was excellent now let's see that let's see it in a practice swing first right next to it all the time that you need just to feel the movement the sequence of movement but we're buffing off all the transitional spaces there one 2 3 4 beautiful now hit one at that same Pace great one two 3 four beautiful now the question here is did you make the movements that you sought to make right and were they buffed off in sequence mhm great that's excellent let's do that one more time and then we'll show a posterior view of this lateral rotation drop sway turn beautiful beautiful K one more with a little bit more energy there so now we'll go ahead and amp it up so we hit it 150 yards but 150 is like 75% of your max at 100 right right okay same movement same sequence you're just managing the energy beautiful what a great way to practice cuz at that pace too you can really feel this movement then this movement then this movement then this one there's enough time mhm to go ahead and like I did it or I didn't yeah right that's fantastic so we got face on let's go ahead and see what this looks like from poster okay T go ahead and hold it Clos line Style again so one of the really nice points in space to take a look at don't mind me back here sacrum tailbone okay so show us the lateral rotation great now we're going to drop and sway good and then all the way to finish from there beautiful okay so let's take a look at where that sacrum really is moving in space let's do this Dynamic now okay with the clothes line still okay but we're feeling this all the edges are buffed off lateral rotation drop sway turn great so in slowing that down we'll be able to see where the sacrum is moving in space MH and what we'll typically see with our our favorite movers from this view here this posterior view is the sacrum will just barely move lateral to start away from the target but then from that point forward and some people don't even in the back swing it'll just stay and then it progresses ly work towards the target into P5 P5 is it's like furthest forward because we've got quite a bit of pressure into the lead side M right in delivery so that now I can go ahead and curve away from there the guys that hit at the furthest the guys that are our favorite movers from P5 all the way to like p7 impact their sacrum moves the most their tailbone moves the most away from the target so as we move into the transition here that's p yep so we're the furthest forward that it has been so if we just go from here okay just from here go back to aess see how much further forward it is that was substantially like four or five inches further forward there you go now as you start to curve the ribs rotating the ribs there goes the sacrum back at me beautiful and there's impact and that moves substantially uhhuh quite our favorite movers like Ricky great mover DJ great mover like those guys their Sacra moves the most but you'll see it like gradually and it's not this like fake out I got to get it up here it's because I'm turning in space okay the pelvis moved and rotated because the upper made it so now my my sacrum is the furthest forward that it ever will be at five I'm here dropped in now I'm going to curve boom and there it goes away yeah right and what we're not really trying to make it go towards and away because of lateral movement in the pelvis no again the only thing that the pelvis is really doing actively is dropping is dropping so by staying dropped As you move Lateral with the ribs that's going to create some of that sacred move that we're seeing exactly it's just a really nice point in space to just pay attention to because it can kind of be a tell for how's the pelvis moving it also can kind of leak and you can kind of see how uh the rib unit is working as well for sure okay so let's see another one here but with a golf club now okay and let's see a pieced out uh progressional sequence movement exercise where we're feeling lateral to start now we're going to turn good now we'd go drop and Sway and now from there you just turn but where's that that sacrum going as you work all the way into finish beautiful that's excellent okay so let's do that again let's hit this one about 100 yards or so and then we'll just pick up the steam all buffed off same movements same sequences nice and buffed off between each sequence beautiful okay now let's see one about 150 yards or so again we're keeping these buffed off we're just playing with the energy that you're putting into the system beautiful that was freaking hit so good that was flush yep okay now let's hit one stock same movements same same sequence of movements manage the energy beautiful what a great look so curious in doing that performing those exercises can you start to sense like where things are moving just a little bit better where sacrum is moving where pelvis is at ribs definitely just having an awareness of those two areas in particular um I can feel that as I'm finishing the turn here I'm not just keeping moving in this direction I'm allowing the sacrum to curve back yep which pulls me up into the Finish yes exactly so definitely increasing the awareness of that yep yep yep so let's do this again from a lateral perspective and we'll we'll showcase one or uh just holding onto your clothes line okay okay so here's where Noggin starts okay let's go ahead and start moving good and now we're going to turn from there beautiful now from here go ahead and drop back in good now your head is slightly further forward than than it was at the start that's because the center mass of the ribs move further forward than they were at a dress right this is the furthest forward your head ever needs to be so now as you curve it's almost as if your head is on a wall there you go and youd stand all the way up as you go into your finish there you go and you'll notice right there there's a little relief late and the head floats forward it's totally fine it's way late we're talking from five all the way through to like nine uhhuh the head doesn't move forward it just stays on this wall gotcha for driver it might even go away from it because like you look at Neiman and how he works through here he keeps working c-spine under leaks into the te so you see him actually work off of that wall away but you won't find really good players that drop and then work the head lateral through the hit NOP they've got all that done in transition at delivery boom now they work off of it or stay on it so it's not like yeah I think a lot of people's misconceptions that they're going to keep moving laterally through the strike all the way in the Finish it's like no your lateral is done up in P5 from there you've got to be moving away that's exactly right and that's why we like the laterals to just be done first like even with you and what I love about your swing you you don't even move the arms of the golf club you get all the lateral done first mhm no you don't need to keep going laterally nope you're already done with it now you can turn but from here now I'm getting all the lateral done before I do anything the forward now I can just turn on it so the laterals are done first then the rotary happens always that's a good sequence for sure okay so super cool to be able to see um just some General Dynamics awesome to see it from well our favorite view here booty View and face on when you're filming so you can kind of start to tell okay well how am I moving one how's the sequence of movement too and then really like now you can start to play with like when the golf club is moving in there as well so really handy just to see not only the beauty of planes and like the golf club on top of the plane and under but you got to make sure that you're moving properly from a face on perspective because you start to see some 3D components as well that really help to round out the entire golf swing so work on it hit some flushies comment below let us know your thoughts let's [Music] go y\n",
      "good so that face is shut so we'll see like and how TJ's doing this is primarily flexion of the wrist compared to extension of the wrist if you just show extension that face flashes open flexion face is shut so now from here if you stay in hip flexion and turn he can square the face now because it was shut yeah with the chest what up te what up dude this is going to be a good one I think purpose of this video is is managing releases unloads how we're unloading it there's all these sexy little terms out there of like low rate of rotation in the club head or in the club face which we we for sure love um however you don't see every single player on earth look that way no as a matter of fact gals on the LPGA Tour on average have higher rates of rotation in the club face than guys on the PGA tour that's interesting cuz they play LPGA Tour golf they're really good they hit 80% of their their their Fairways which is much higher than the men mhm but they have higher rates of rotation we equate higher rates of rotation is higher chance for catastrophic misses and missing it both left and right blah blah blah blah blah John ROM at like exit you'll see his face I mean it's darn near pointing towards the ground is yeah Fleetwood looks like this yep well who's the better ball Striker well day in and day out they both strike it really well exactly but probably John ROM right I mean yeah I mean if you're looking at like overall man it's just an argument like that's a fun like bar conversation sure right who hits it better well he hits it farther agree they both they both flush it they both hit it great and you look at like how they exit and they're both different mhm right so the whole deal here is release is about matchups and understanding do I need more rate of rotation or more rotation in the club head through the strike or would it be good for me to soften that out a little bit it depends on every single athlete okay okay now what we'll typically see with a rate of rotation that's elevated so let's see like that that finish in that unload you don't need to hit a shot here just show like kind of through the ribs so we're right there so what you'll see is emblem stays away from TJ we'll see the face close down quite a little bit like why does that happen well two main things to look at right off the bat one where's the golf club in delivery so P5 typically what we'll see is somebody that has the golf club more open in this position okay okay okay so this is what's interesting as well most of the time players that have more open Club faces at P5 hit draws M figure that one out well how you going to close the close the club face yeah I mean you're you're probably not going to be able to close it all the way with just chest rotation right I'm not really going to get yeah see it's inappropriately too open because this is the main motor right we got to share the motor now with the arms and the Hand unit so to Clare we go so rapid rate rotation through the strike because I have it open matches this area up so this is going to slow down the chest is going to slow down if not stall while the arms take over for a second to help close the face down exactly and as soon as I get the arms going I'm going to start to shoot energy out of the golf club like imagine if I filled the golf club up with water and put a little like soft cap on it as soon as I stop this and I go with the arms it shoots the energy out like I'd shoot the water out of it okay so I get I get the energy in the club head going which direction now down downward M so I've got to stop and extend there you go ah so if the club goes down you got to move up uhhuh so and you won't see anybody that just does this they're just going to start actively rotating the pelvis this will stall a bit now I can rotate the golf club and we see that out of players that have usually less mass and are shorter we'll see that type of release pattern cuz it's a really good way to get energy out of the system to be able to like hit the ball higher right that's a good way to do that and we'll tend to draw it so like younger Juniors yeah this is a great way yeah to learn how to golf cuz we got to have a ball that's tumbling like if you're going to get it out there efficiently tumbling meaning like draw based right it's going to roll more drawing so it carries its Optimum when it hits it rolls its Optimum that's Optimum distance for like a younger Junior exactly we also see that same type of pattern we t typically see really heavy rates of rotation for World Long Drive athletes interesting yep okay so it's a great way to hit it far ah yes so more more distance that way okay exactly now DJ hits it a long ways he didn't hit it nearly as far as world long drive guys no no but but he's trying to to play tournament golf at a very very high level where if we have some of these shots that really really hurts him where the long drive guy can afford to miss a few exactly because most most guys would go well the argument would be well DJ hits it the long ways well no kidding he hits the long ways he's a PGA Tour player but at the end of the day he can't be a PGA Tour player and blast it in the rough a whole lot no so his shut face yep pairs really well and let's go all the way to delivery good so that face is shut so we'll see like and how TJ's doing this is primarily flexion of the wrist compared to extension of the wrist if you just show extension that face flashes open f flexion face is shut so now from here if you stay in hip flexion and turn he can square the face now because it was shut yeah with the chest which is interesting because most players that cut the golf ball shut it are shut at delivery and I think a lot of people watching this are going to just realize that one thing and go oh I've been thinking about this all wrong exactly face open in delivery I can draw it easier mhm face shut in delivery I can cut it easier yes exactly and I'm not saying like do do you hit draws and cuts based on where you're at in delivery not necessarily zero I I don't do that either I don't think anybody that's worth a darn does that like we're not saying that it's just this is to match up what you're looking for so okay how do I how do I get this into delivery and we're talking degrees here we're not going like wide open or dead dead shut just small degrees of like I need a little bit more closure I need a little bit more more like softening here to open the face dependent upon like how I want to work through here and dependent upon the ball flight sure okay so again reviewing if we're hitting if we're seeing like heavier rate of rotation we're probably seeing more vertical athletes and we're seeing athletes that get the golf club in more of an open position at P5 right okay so if you're wanting to work into again do do we have preferences of course we have preferences like would mostly be the shut face rotators exactly that is like the sexiest thing on Earth yeah yeah it's it really is when I hit one and I look back at it on a video and I finally see the face pointing back I'm like finally let's go all Juiced up but look like one we're golf coaches sure so we're messing with stuff all the time all the time always tinkering so always tinkering the other thing is just like if you are going to master your golf swing mhm you better understand systems at a really really high level totally so if I want to move into low rate of rotation what are what's what's the what are the movements that I need to have where do I need the golf club organized in delivery all of these things go into this like really really important Okay and like what we're doing actively with the hands and what we're doing passively with the hands is vitally important low rate of rot is a passive response to good movement and what we're doing in the arm system and the Hand system way earlier than the hit mhm okay so let's go into um POS uh P3 okay P3 okay so from here what we'll see out of good movers okay um or or just not necessarily good movers but like good golfers in general is as the golf club's working up we're going to see a change in Direction with the body so let's see here this isn't our preference but let's see a player that rotates the pelvis from here good to go ahead and sequence this out TJ's going to show shoulder extension to get the golf club deeper here so the shaft is a lot taller okay that's how we're going to organize so we would see a little bit of like probably adduction into here and and shoulder extension to get the golf club into kind of a hitable position with pelvic active pelvic rotation I see okay so the forces are going yes exactly and that's heavily overdone but from there like go ahead and do that again boom now if you kept turning the pelvis and now fired the arms let's see how the golf club reacts and response we would see that okay so Juniors and not all but a lot of players quite a few players in the LPGA Tour we'll see that shorter players not as not as massive of play of people people as well so we're going to see that more than we're going to see on the PGA tour sure okay so let's go to three okay so that's heavier RS of rotation in the club face okay now as the arms are going up we're going to show pelvic drop so hip flexion good and as this is happening as well we want the club to get behind more so we'll see this lead arm ribs all look to get the golf club in this position here mhm roughly okay so the golf club's out so where are the forces going so if we go back to three okay here we go you're in charge of drop so the forces are going with the golf club mhm now we need to understand what we're doing in here in the rest the Active Release would be Trail wrist supination and it's supination because we have so much extension in this Trail wrist but the supination would make the golf club look like it just continues to seek the ground see how the forces are going in the same direction here good but I keep that extension as you're suating turn the chest there we go so now we're getting ready to get into the strike and from here if you kept turning eventually the energy washes out of the wrist and the passive release is extension keep turning the chest to flexion look at that face dead Square uhhuh yep so Active Release once you get into five is supination with chest rotation there's the active the passive because there's energy stored in here and you're going to keep turning the chest there's the passive release here okay lot going on there but a ton going on but we've got to understand all of that sure like how does that all work where am I putting forces we need the forces to keep going behind me and down cuz we'll see guys that get into five and then just screw it up because they're trying to square it and their old pattern and totally screw up the strike mhm but I'm in here I need this to be the main engine but if I shut this off the golf club just stays high oh that's interesting right so we if I just turn it just stay level see how this just stays level around TJ so you'd miss the golf ball by 3 ft so this you got to keep itation helps you get it down there it is yep uhhuh okay so let's see two patterns let's see and this can be super slow to you don't need to go hard at it but let's see a really low rate of rotation first okay okay in the face because of how you're getting into five and then from five how am I going through here to here all right to slow down the rate of rotation low rate of rotation first y you can show a little mocker first if you want boom boom there we go and just pitchy out there but you're just playing with match ups and movement there we go beautiful okay now let's see high rate of rotation so we're going to throw more active pelvic and we're going to let this go into more extension as this works by the chest there we go and now how would you unload it there you go just a chippy one as well there you go okay now you you've been working your butt off on one pattern for sure but you're also big strong studly man so lots of mass sure so it's it's you can have a ton of transmission of energy through rotation and slow down the rate of rotation in the face okay that's freaking awesome but you have close to 180 ball speed sure okay well the ball speed on the LPGA Tour is not even close to that it's it's like 140 I believe so the ball's just not in the air long enough plus like when I'm releasing it here mhm I'm getting energy out into the ball this way boom I can launch it higher I can draw it easier mhm you see that a ton on the LPGA Tour drivers of the golf ball on the LPGA Tour typically draw pattern drivers on the on the PGA tour typically faded there you go so you have to just understand what pattern is going to be best for you for a lot of different reasons this is just release pattern we're not talking about health cuz there's Health consequences to each pattern as yeah and just understanding that for longevity is important but we're also not seeing Juniors get injured because one they're pliable to they don't have as much mass so we don't have as much energy in in individual joint complexes to create energy if you do that in your Brooks kka probably have a shelf life you do this in your yeah Nelly Corda you're going to be all right yeah 100 pounds yep right totally so you got to understand and identify where you're at and and and make the best choice according to the info that you have right that's why we give all this info so that you can understand and make the best informed decision that's exactly right okay so just to reiterate here just so that we're not just GL like grazing over this sure preference in our pattern understanding our system better again systems have bookins so what we're looking to do is like knock people through this wall to understand like okay I feel stuff now once you're in five Y which is drop primarily ribs to get the golf club leveled out back here but you'll notice how that affects this lead arm like it works away you see a lot of space there that helps to get the center mass of the golf club down there you go and what tej is showing right there is continuing the forces here that's active Trail wrist supination to move it there we're getting it going behind and down keeping it going that direction got it that matches with shut face uhhuh and chest rotation there you go and so the passive release that you're going to feel feel is that action there so this whole like idea of like actively trying to move this way it only works if we've got the other parts of the system there yeah your body's got to be moving in the way that supports that otherwise that's just going to feel crummy just to go one step further your body and the instrument instr we're not like throwing the Dynamics here and then interrupting that ever so the whole system's got to support that action if you got one piece of it it just ain't going to feel right that's exactly right so let's see one more here okay so we understand how we're getting into five how you keep the forces of the golf club working in the same direction as you turn on it and the release will just happen on its own wo there it is you can feel that too huh yeah can I flush this one yeah let's just flush one out I like flushies ones that just sound right like echoed it's still hissing know the system to release it better educate your hands on how they support the golf club through the strike body supports everything as well flush them out baby let's go yes [Music] sir\n",
      "let's hit one more just focused on focused on press pressure the feet yep okay lateral curve back up into lead curves away that was even better that was even [Music] better let's start this again oh now brown cow hi TJ hey bro how you doing I'm awesome man how are you good good dude we're uh uh back outside maybe one of the last times that we'll be outside uh here in in Colorado I want to hear that I know got a pretty fun video here absolutely a lot of questions on this one mhm what are we talking about today there te uh creating space in the golf swing um I think a lot of people struggle with just feeling real bunched up down at impact like they don't have any room to move whether that's their arms their chest Etc yeah yeah and I think that's um it's it's funny because golfers um you know we're fortunate enough to work with a a lot of players and a lot of golf nerds as well and one of the things that um is always interesting is the saying that you know after we start moving and they kind of get into a system that we really like they go man it feels like I have so much room or so much space at the bottom hear that a lot okay and that's kind of important too it's not like we're talking about space up here at the top we're talking about like the hit area and feeling like we just have room to do stuff down there like the arms have like passage they can move they can swing like I don't feel like I'm like bottled up and like I don't have room to operate down there which is like a highly unathletic feel no yeah like feeling all bunched up down here it's like what are we what are we doing yeah yeah yeah exactly and just it's this again this idea of of space is like massively important so again where does it come from how do we create these spatial pieces right so um let's just start with just a general concept te if you go ahead and set up for us you got it the number one spatial piece that we're going to look at here number one is the the radius that you have just created and set up from your sternum to the club head like the middle of the club so the radius is just the middle portion of that Circle it's just this space like how far away you are so you can just kind of visualize a straight line coming right out of your sternum yep pointing right of the club head exactly exactly so if you just make a back swing for us let's go ahead and just do that okay did your sternum get further away or closer to the ball in that move a little further away a lot further away like probably another foot so it's moved clearly this way right yes exactly okay well where did that come from interesting okay so we talk a lot about like this thoracic region and what it does again this is review for those of you that watch our Channel a lot which thank you um but the main purpose of the chest and its movement is um it we move it laterally we'll rotate it and there is in our in our C and and T spine primarily we've got this thoracic Bend this lateral Bend okay okay so again this is kind of piggybacking off of like one of the videos that we did very recently which is this idea of lateral move first so if I have this space right here away from the golf ball if I move laterally just this move am I getting closer or further away from the ball you're getting a little further away from it there we go if I just turned okay and we'll talk about proper turn here just in a second and I'll do this properly if I turn did I get further or closer to the ball further away from it okay so a lot of people like if you stack up this lead side and and the the visual here is like these lead side joints like main joint joint groups knee complex hip complex shoulder complex there's two ways to turn and and really when we're saying Turn I'm just moving this midline and rotating it away from the target okay got it so I could have a pivot where the pivot is is more so in this like right side and so if I were to turn I would look like this okay okay this would be improper because these lead side joints just crashed into this space so they all go towards the golf ball in that respect if the it's in the right yes got it exactly so what we'll see is this idea that the the the player will exactly immediately move ESP you'll see it definitely in the knee and definitely in the shoulder this just responds okay but it crashes into this space here closer to the golf ball got it and now like one there is no lateral move if you're moving that way yeah I'm I'm All stacked up on this side too exactly so your sternum may have gone a bit away a little bit away from the golf ball but it's not far enough because these lead joints are actually closer to the ball got it so to create space late what would you have to do well I'm going to have to yeah jump up out of the way right yep which causes this extension move here where you just went with this Trail hip if you go in extension here which means this hip is coming into this space here where does your sternum go uh towards the ball or away from it away from the ball right they just work in opposition so if I move my pelvis forward so this is just hip extension this has to go back to keep me just in general balance okay so I'm I'm creating some space with the sternum but I'm doing it with with this move yes and maybe there's some problems with that there's a lot of problems with that right because the the issue with this space feel is like if I go into extension here I I don't I no longer have room for my arms to swing underneath my trunk as soon as I go here this this is where the arms want to swing and I'm in the way so guess what they're out and around I don't have any room in here M you'll see these guys like that way where the room between like the handle and their pelvis is really has really shrunk so the player experiences this feeling where the arms don't have room I don't have any space for them to swing across or underneath my trunk or the thoracic so there's a sequence to this in that we need the sternum in like the early portion of the back swing to really be creating this space because the pivot is more in the right hip sock or excuse me the um the lead side joints okay so the right side those joints would move this way there you go now just as the athlete like if we both have a golf ball right here sure okay getting ready to hit if I go this way okay where did your sternum go relative to the golf ball in that move closer good compared to this way further away like how much more room do you have now tons yes yep and what we'll see like almost in every single like really high level player that we love their their pattern like Rory you'll see his lead leg actually go into a bit of extension to start like a bit it's not a ton he's and he's not just pushing this it's because he's moved laterally so the knee almost hides behind the trail knee uhhuh there it is is yeah so just this early lateral boom see that like this knee just hides got it then from here as he turns and is reentering his turn makes his sternum move away and now as he drops and move into moves into the lead side way more flexion so he's moved this back into this space but it's no closer than where it started at a dress meaning when I'm saying it's I'm saying the sternum isn't any closer okay he like not like in transition Rory's crashing all the way in here M right he just if this is our start point we move away yep and then back to the start point exactly there you go because now from there like what what we're searching for is this idea that as I rotate my t-spine okay or my thoracic through the strike that my arms can get shot out and the curve like this whole like low left yep phase like this thought and like we see this like the club is low left yeah the the reason it's low left is because of the curvature in the thoracic this High exit okay kind of a different topic but it's important for the whole piece here is if I crash and I'm creating space this locks down I'm no longer rotating this so as I fire the arms where do they exit way high exactly compared to off of it drop back in now as I turn all I'm doing is letting the energy go out but I'm not trying to make it go left it goes left that free rotation of the thoracic that creates the low left exit yes to really achieve that you've got to have space to do so you've got to be in here where now I can freely rotate exactly shoot the arms out so a lot of it is just a sequence of stuff like if I rotate early chances are I'm going to crash the lead joints into the golf ball space and the sternum isn't far enough away to be able to drop back in yes but if I go lateral early uhhuh and then turn with the pivot being in here yeah see how this lead stayed away from this space like let's let's do two different movements here go ahead and show proper movement good see this knee pretty much the entire time stayed away now in transition watch where it goes it'll come back into this space there you go but your sternum isn't any closer than where it started compared to go ahead and start again okay go ahead and pivot poorly meaning the pivots in your Trail side so all this would work into the space see this knee immediately crashed mhm and so now big pelvic rotation to get that out of there and then see how that moved the sternum away so now you created space from the sternum but you don't have space for the arms to swing freely and you want both right we need them both working like when people say oh man I have space what they're really saying is the arms have room they have free passage under the trunk got it rather than if I do this I have I no longer have that yep okay so there's kind of a lot there so how do we take this and like just generally digest it sure okay so to have space when I say that we're saying that the arms have free passage to have space in the hit we need to move in proper sequence in the load phase okay load phase is from P1 to P5 and generally P5 is just this delivery position and what we want from there is the idea now that the pivot can be in the trail uh hip complex and Trail shoulder and Trail knee complex so I'd be going lateral chest rotation or thoracic rotation once I feel that go now I'm just going to drop and that dropping gets me landed back up in this see all this knee flexion mhm that's where the load the finish of the load that's perfect so from right there trail trail trail this is all the pivot and let's go ahead and do this with a step so if we're here M if we stepped we'd look like this there you go and that creates space again lot the space yep there you go and there goes the sternum away and so what do the arms hands and Club get to do shoot shoot out yeah just goes yeah it's like it's like hard to even get into the ground that way like you got so much space there you got room yep yep totally exactly and for driver we'll actually see what you just did in certain players totally Patrick Reed uh Lead Foot D weights well you'll definitely see the long drive patterns too right this V weting going that way so what's really important here if we're going to going to do that I can't just drop improperly and be back like most of the pressure is in my trail foot if I'm going to have the pivot back in this like Trail hip complex I had better be up here like I've got 70 80% of my pressure up here right now because now as this becomes the pivot who boom now I'm good you can move away yeah and with long drive pattern that's the lateral move mhm but what's kind of coola here is we're combining two of these forces together in our minds because the rotation rotational Force this angular Force to shoot out there's my space so I can do that also creates the lateral Force the opposing Force so I've got this pressure up in the lead foot if this is the pivot rotate rotate rotate see where my pressure starts to go yep now I'm more like 50/50 in here totally so as the lateral starts to work away and we'll see this in drivers for sure like long drive pattern I'm away away away guess what the club gets to do shoot out it shoots an opposition I'm going that way because of curvature not because I'm just doing this like Rocky stuff through the strike up here turning see how I'm going away from the Target and allows this to shoot out because you've got such good thoracic rotation that moves you away yep so it's not it's not like you're just tilting back yes right it's so all this talk the reason this is like such a deep conversation yep is because this idea or this feeling this athletic feeling of space for the arms to swing freely is in 3D space and that's difficult to visualize sometimes human beings suck at 3D space totally we can see 2D so lines yeah yep like this oh he's dropping I see that well I'm on this plane 2D right as soon as I drop and turn it's like okay well where did the pelvis really good like this math equation starts in our mind M it's like rubbing the top of your head and your stomach in opposite directions at the same time two simple feels it's hard to picture and hard to like execute on absolutely yeah okay so working on this like what we need from a dynamic perspective is the ability in the transitional phase so we'll call that from P3 to P5 okay that the player is working back into this space so that they can get out of that space through the strike and they're getting out of that space right there because of rotation and the pivot point there you go and the golf club could just go wo out yeah got it yep so try practicing this very good thing for players to do just to experience this is big lad you can do it with wedge just try it with seven iron at first and then you can just kind of tame it down so it feels right but big lateral move big away big drop in for load so we're huge here boom I'm way up here it feels like I've almost like dynamically invaded this space so that now this can be the pivot and I can shoot all this out that's what we want so that's the feel right yes so if we're just looking at unload phase it's the pivot that's back here and you've got all this pressure that's gone into like this space up in here like we're up there there you go so that now this can stay back there and all those there you go and you can see how the golf club would just shoot out yeah okay so let's see one that's cruisy okay but we got big lateral big away kind of into P3 got it right so just show us kind of P3 and it's just going to be lateral away good now ideally we're right here so I'll help you okay so as I'm motoring this up into P5 like through P4 to P5 you just drop back into that space good excellent now from there turn and shoot it there you go okay let's see one kind of cruised out lateral away drop back in and then shoot beautiful beautiful now when TJ does that that's really interesting did you hit that well no is that hosle yeah it was hle it's awesome pretty good okay so th this is where you get to diagnose correctly this is actually kind of fun uhhuh so you hit it on the hosle did you feel like you shot energy out I did you did do that so we need more space which means that this is the pivot we need to shoot the pivot back into the trail hit more so we can curve away more let's do the same exercise more space on this side right yep exactly you can even feel as if like because of the space that you're creating you're going to hit it on the toe on this one let's do the same exercise let's drop back in good beautiful much better there you go so again you're messing with the system and in order to be able to feel good through the strike totally see one in in one motion now sure lateral pivot to move it away drop back in pivot to turn it away oh and what's awesome like I can see it and you can feel it how easy it was for the golf club to just go it just shoots through energy or through the through the impact and again if we talking like feelings that we're searching for with students that's one that I'm hunting for is like the golf club feels free just totally free like it gets so far out away from you fully released all that goodness yep but we get all the like really good stuff because thoracic rotation is the main face stabilizer so it doesn't feel like it's spinning out of there it feels like it easily releases blah blah blah mhm okay final topic on this okay and this can help just like kind of sense if I'm moving well or not just where the pressure is going okay so let's go ahead and just set up together here and we're going to set up so that we're like feels like we're either like on the balls are slightly into the toes to start with so we're definitely not heel loaded we're more like balls of the feet toe bias got it okay when we go lateral we're going to stay out in that ball of the foot we're not like if I rotate right here I'm going to go I'm going to go into the heel straight to the heel yep so I stay out here now as I curve I'm going to go into the the the arch of the Trail foot and probably 70ish per that's right here in the arch of the foot okay SE meaning 70% of my weight here 30% of my weight here okay okay now as I turn and I'm and I'm dropping now I'm going to work back heavily like 80% up here into the ball of this foot okay so it traced from away into the arch and then goes back up this way yeah maybe we could show that from here too yep so it goes away then curves a bit into the arch and then back into the meat of this foot got it now from there that's just the load phase that shape okay there you go beautiful now from there as you curve you're going to go into the heel and then away and it curves away that way there you go and if you just kept spiraling you go all the way up in Finish there you go but see where TJ lands is like on the outer rim of the lead heel mhm okay that's where you're going to feel pressure move there you go got it okay so if you can feel it go directly lateral then curve and go back up into the Lead Foot and then curve away it's like this figure eight look pressure-wise totally that's a great way to like oh I feel where I'm moving in space cool okay let's hit one more just focused on focused on pressure pressure in theet yep okay lateral curve back up into lead curves away that was even better that was even better okay so the point being there are six ways to sunde to do this well yep and everybody's attracted to different different like feels pictures whatever some people are great at just picturing where the chest complex is working or where the sternum is working even where their head is working where the trail hip is working Le like you can focus on different things so many focal points yeah for sure yes but I think a really great one is just feeling where pressure is moving which is the doorway then to feeling oh I have space yeah I've created space totally but we got to see it in 3D models that's why it's a bit of a complex exercise or complex pict but worth worth diving into for sure because once you have it the athletic sensation is like dude like zero catastrophic misses like it feels amazing you can create speed it's precise it's really healthy like it just it's goes on and on man it goes on and on it feelsit freaking amazing that's probably benefit number one it feels incredible exactly exactly work on it comment below uh let us know what your experience is like with it we'd love to answer any questions that you have flush them out baby turkey it's almost Thanksgiving that was [Laughter] [Music] good\n",
      "I don't even know how to like begin this I how to describe it necessarily what we want is simpler and simpler visions of like how things really work in the golf swing let's start this is a three-phase exercise all right okay let's start just with the body te so if we're here just at at nor neutral setup what we're going to imagine is that there is a um hula hoop we've just placed down on the ground that's going right around where the golf ball would be perfect TJ found the toy imagine just this hula hoop being maybe twice as big so it'd be right in this area okay so it's right next to TJ's feet got it what we're initially going to do is feel that the pelvis is moving around the hula hoop in a counterclockwise fashion so yep so if I were just going to walk around it I would walk around my hula hoop like that that's exactly right so see what where the axis of your hips goes like do that again see there okay so where's your midline pointing right now that way that way so because of that you've rotated the midline towards the target to some degree there you go so what TJ just did without moving like walking around that Hulu hoop is he went right here okay so a couple things where' midline go towards the target towards the target where did my pressure go from a lateral perspective away from the target yes my right foot yep exactly where we see almost everybody screw it up is they'll immediately start to rotate their midline away and we see this because we always talk about the ribs of the engine and the arms respond sure so we'll see people cheat this and they'll go pelvic rotation that leaks up into my into the ribs like if you kept rotating the in the pelvis now it's up into the ribs so your midline is over here eventually yes the arms lift but what it does is if you kept turning it throws the golf club under mhm you'll lift now and start to turn the other direction so see where that went AB so now you have to tilt big time to get the golf club slotted and you're whacked yeah that's whack yeah super whack that ain't it what we prefer to see is the club swing on top of the plane okay and then it falls under the plane so let's let's do this now go ahead and set up to the golf ball sure and show the first portion what we just what we just were working on right there there's the pelvis now what's important how much did the arms and Club move none none do that again did the chest move a little bit some yeah so this will leak so we're not just like rigid here in the shoulder axis sure but we're we're just kind of playing with the pelvis there's the trail foot pressure there's the lateral pressure we've got the midline over here that's great so here's the trippy thing that's the back swing okay dude what yeah yeah all right go ahead because now what it's going to do is as we start to spiral so the upper spiral is going to lead the turn if you've seen any of the other videos that we've done we talk about spiral line all the time upper spiral is going to start to turn okay okay and what that's going to indicate is the start of transition look at these are just Maps so once I start so no don't you see how you trying to cheat pelvis so I got to go so there's the chest see it moves the club because the rib started to move it moves the club and what it just just did is you moved the club on top of the plane because of this so it's gliding up it's gliding cool I mean I see I see people do this all the time right where they go they go pelvis back yep and then they know the the club needs to be on top of the plane so they lift yeah so it gets whacked out so do that at the same time pelvis and arms that just looks not right like not like an athlete yeah so like if if I if I just let the club go where it wants to go there it wants to go under yes now if I go hula hoop yep and I let the club go it wants to go yep now just keep turning the chest perfect perfect it works right up so the midline during the entirety of transition is moving away from the target this is really important what we'll see a lot of people do is they'll go up here to the top like finish their back swing and when they drop they start to early unwind so they go so the drop you can throw in drop as you're turning away so as I'm moving into the like just remember this see where my mid Line's pointing yep okay so my midline is pointing right here at the camera if I turn over here okay like I was and I drop where's it look like my pressure goes into your heels okay but in this case the pressure is going that direction yeah so if I'm here and I turn my midline over here yeah and I drop pressure goes to Target there you go so this becomes the pivot so the whole look is I'm Ro I'm I'm here now as I go turn turn turn and drop I'm there see how TJ's midline kept moving in this space as he dropped so you're not dropping an early unwinding there you go that's the whole load perfect okay I mean took a minute to get there but now it seems extremely simple the other really cool thing with this is this is like one of the primary shallows okay okay so okay so set up again show me back swing all right our version of back swing sure okay now at some point of course this lead arm is going to start to lift so I'll I'll be the lifter here you're in charge of turning so slowly do this okay so good so it's up on top of the plane okay your mid your arms are always going to be working up the midline line like at at a certain point they're going to be working up well what are you doing with your midline during the load phase keeping it going that way so where's the club go yeah keeps working over here moves there so the arms work up right but if I work them up and turn with that where do they go oh dude there you go so it's yes so now we need to bounce pivots cool all right so let's talk that so we just talked about the whole load phase so if you could te just hug the club or throw the club down one or the other okay and show just the load phase back swing and transition okay perfect because TJ's up here like how much pressure do you feel like you have here compared to your Trail foot maybe 8020 okay 8020 the more that you're up here 8020 is the further back you can put your your pivot or push your pivot so this this now and we'll do a step drill actually te this is the pivot this is a door knob step this foot out of there there you go okay do that one more time perfect there you go now that one he did without stepping but same feel but same feel and this is also where maintained flexion comes from like I want flexion rotation I want to keep the flexion state in my hips I always early extand it's because of how you move you move horrible you big dork sure okay so if we're going back swing pivot based on the upper spiral good now bounce pivots because this is going to curve there you go this is also where trading of the bins happens right okay like right now TJ's in a very in a in a very neutral spine show the pelvic action that we talked about for backs sping good so right now he's in a slight amount because this was the main engine for for movement slight amount of right Bend got it okay as he starts to Upper spirals do this slowly now he's moving into lead Bend okay and where he's at right now he's where's your pressure up towards Target up towards your target so it's in the lead foot so we've got us the proper amount of lead Bend start slowly pivoting properly now you just bounced oh yeah yep now you're in now you're in trail Bend so you went from lead to Trail because of how you pivoted here but the only way that we can have this pivot here is being up here far enough so that now I can go that way if I do most people never get up there far enough right absolutely okay so there and it's because they early unwind mhm early unwind so it's all yes so so many people's action of of hit is that that's that's how they shoot energy into the club and hit right so this is going to like pelvis going forward towards the target is not not hit no that's what we we classified as like swing vers hit a swinger vers a hitter okay so swingers look like they're active active with the pelvic rotation like even in the transitionary phase and then they'll rotate like kind of tumble the golf club along the plane that's a swinger that's a swinger a hitter like if I had a PVC or um a like a sledgehammer and an Axe and a wall right here I I wouldn't just open up and then throw it I would first probably step and then from here I'm going to turn but look at where the pivots going to be exactly don't you hit me with that I'm kidding I'm going to step so I'm at my midline still over here here's the pivot point and I'm going to go boom yes that's the hit that's a hitter versus a swinger okay again it's just our terminology fair enough okay yeah Maps improving Maps improving how do we how do we uh do this with a golf ball so let's do this go ahead and set up to a ball okay preset back swing our back swing good go all the way to transition perfect hit it perfect okay so really all that stuff that we just talked about the most the craziest of drills would be three steps yeah yeah you can do three steps we're talking about pretty much the entirety of golf swing in this video uhuh I don't know what to title this thing we'll figure it out do cool things with your golf swing look neat okay boom upper spiral to control the pivot pivot perfect okay now we'll we'll just mess around with this we'll do two different modified two pieces okay set up to it show me back swing to transition is one movement pivot perfect there's one two-piece okay show me just back swing pivot to Pivot oh I like that one a lot yeah cuz you know why cuz it like when people go oh that was really good there's feeling athleticism yes athleticism means that we sense things so we feel bounciness we feel when stuff loads we feel when stuff out unloads it just feels nice and that's where Rhythm comes from yeah so Rhythm kind of coming from the uhhuh from the lower half here yep okay now let's let's show a 60% but it bounces through all three phases we're never to a position we're through these transitionary phases boom boom boom and that one probably felt really fun too that one did feel pretty fun okay now just mess around with it cuz now I mean TJ you've been doing a lot of this stuff for a long time sure but I mean you'll fall into the system so fast now let's just test the system throw as much energy as you can into this while while staying within the confines of the system stay a hitter okay and it's still bouncy we're never rigid boom boom boom okay that's hosle that's hosle exactly so what's interesting yeah uh-huh exactly so it's like now you know where stuff is like wrong so when I go high energy that's my tendency that's where your mind wants to go to create a a a higher swing speed I go different map to create that swing speed there you go yep okay stay within the confines of the system there we go totally different yeah and that's what's nice if you have a system and you get outside of it oh you have awareness and you can diagnose and fix the darn problem yes Mastery in your golf swing we talked about this in another video Mastery in your golf swing is not flush flush flush forever it don't look like that at all no it's not mastering your golf swing means that you missed a shot you diagnose well so that you improve it on the next ones to come like that's that's way cooler way cooler and it's realistic uhhuh I think I think that'll do it for today that enough to chew on that's enough to chew on that's a lot to chew on drop comments there's going to be so many questions on this like a bunch of questions one one thing that we guarantee that we will do we will always respond to those those comments this is there for you to improve your golf game you're going to have questions ask the darn question we will help you with the response it also helps us with future videos 100% ask the questions you guys rock you're pretty cool too you're all right okay [Music] thanks\n",
      "we're going to talk about proper setup in the golf swing so you can actually move not like a dork don't be a dork don't be a dork okay so I think for folks that like um really follow our our Channel you they know how like freaking psycho we are and infatuated with Movement we are yeah like we love that stuff and it looks all like cool and sexy and um but what I think we've always like kind of just skipped over is how to stand to the damn thing right which is actually really important oh dude it it dictates everything it dictates what you can and cannot do we want in honesty we probably want more things that we can't do interesting based on how you set up okay rather than this allows you to do whatever right we want to like be able to get in this point where it's like we we're not going to move this way want that just based on how you set up to it you can eliminate a lot of those potential like mistakes yes right that's exactly right so General theme in this video we'll talk about pressures meaning I'm standing here so if I'm on a pressure plate where my balance really is in in golf swing sure okay we need to to be able to set up in a way where our arms can move in certain ways okay and and certain setup positions will allow or not allow ow for certain arm movement okay arm movement again what we're going to talk about primarily is like shoulder complex when we talk about arms we're talking from shoulder complex to the Elbow complex so this is the arm these are hands cuz the two bones that are in here in your forearm that's what makes this all rotate so that's hand action right so right in here and then finally like how the spine is going to operate throughout the course of the entire swing the spine goes in extension and flexion M so this way right it does lateral bending and it rotates it does a lot bounces through all of that so we need to be able to set up in a certain way that allows for that like our spine to be able to operate properly and it helps the entire system absolutely okay let's talk about the spine first so te throw your Club down for just a second what I want you to do is put your arms straight out in front of you now what I want you to do is take your scaps and we're going to pull these back behind you okay so the more that you pull your this is called scap retraction scap retraction does that move your spine into more of an extension state or more of a flexion State Extension exactly it's like elongated it's almost like you're trying to take your scapula and and bring them together they move this way and as that happens just how the spine responds to that is it moves into t-spine extension okay okay now push them away from you so it feels like like your scaps are going to go around your scaps actually do they go around your rib cage this way so scap right here scap right here so if you push forward your scaps go there got and it moves this into more of a flexion State got it okay so why the hell are we talking about that CU it's important it's important this is why it's important when we're setting up to the golf ball what we want is again the body is going to support The Swinging action of the arms so if you set up right here te like go ahead and just set up like you kind of normally do pull your scaps together back here scap retraction see where the humorous goes mhm goes onto the side of the ribs yep how much can the arms really swing from right there and just I test does that dude look right no no he doesn't look right so if you see this guy and like I want my spine to be straight this guy well even if you go into spine extension you're your scaps are going to retract it's just how our body works you can't go into scap protraction and extension of the spine it's not going to happen it does not work fa fa we don't move that way okay so we want the arms meaning the humorous the humai to be on top of the chest when you did that your scaps went into a protracting state yes they did which makes this go into some amount of flexion I see it so more a slight amount more Flex then neutral got it cuz we don't we don't stand like this we stand like that that's neutral scap neutral shoulder complex neutral spine neutral neutral neutral and we're just going to there you go that's it so see how it makes this round just a bit more it doesn't need to be excessive no but a little bit but that's it exactly so if you just stand normal okay just stand like we chat all right all right okay good so from there if you just went into a squat like you're in a squat rack right now and you had a squat bar on you okay feel where your pressure is now now drop like you're squatting where's your pressure moving uh does it move more into the balls of the feet when you do that or more into the heels I guess more into the heels yes yeah that would be proper so it again just like eye test look like if you're looking at this if I squat and I'm going into the balls of my feet this guy compared to this guy you can just tell which one looks better it's funny like eye test is is something that almost everybody should just take into account if it looks right chances are it's right it is right from an athletic perspective fair so where the pressure is going okay from like this north south okay direction is it's moving rearward posterior it's moving that way okay so we're start with that all right so if you set up TJ go ahead and set up like you normally would for a golf swing but just set up more heel loaded like the pressure would move there good now try to squat okay yeah I'm already there so I can't go further back so you have room to move this way there you go so what is that yeah there's your hip extension there's hip extension so if we get to the top like what we want to be able to do is drop okay and if I'm already in my heels just in setup right like if I'm sitting back into these heel like that's where my pressure is and I swing it to the top and I try to drop you're not going to have room to be able to do it and you got all the room the other way yeah that's interesting that's really interesting okay so we want to preset almost to the point in like learning this it would be really cool to overdo this cuz we've kind of got like four different portions of the foot sure you got heel sure more in the arch M the ball of the foot and the toes from this north south Direction yep set up for us and you have almost 100% of your pressure on the toes so it be as far north as you could get so not this way just over how you're going to get there is like you're just falling over it's almost like if you had a pool in front of you and you're ready to like dive in there that way just that look looks okay it's a little overdone this way sure but now try to drop I got so much so much room to yes exactly so coming from more of a toe bias I can actually now afford to move more that way transition which is what we want which is what we want that's our preference in our system okay okay so we'll just call this diving board posture okay in that like if we're standing right exactly so if I'm getting ready to just jump in I'm going to go this way that's see I'm like heavy into the balls of my feet or into the toes this is okay this is okay you can drop it back into the balls of the feet and it's super subtle this is just what we want to like stay away from when we're setting up interesting okay we want to move there in the golf swing yep okay yep the final bit is just this like we hear a lot about this this anterior versus uh posterior pelvic tilt okay so show anterior tilt so anterior tilts that way exactly so if you could think of and you just said this before making this video like Fishbowl like if you can imagine your pelvis is a fishbowl okay and we wanted to Spill the water out forward like out of my belt buckle my pelvis would been this way so that's extension in the L spine so my pelvises went there exactly exactly okay or if you went posterior pelvic tilt we're we're trying to pour that water out the other direction okay and all that we're doing like you'll see it's very subtle it's just in my belt line here anterior tilt posterior tilt okay we want to go and move more into a posterior bias Okay the reason that we're doing this is we're moving everything like all of that makes us go into more of a flexion state in the entire spine so if we go heavy protraction here in the scaps t-spine flexion now show posterior pelvic tilt there's L spine flexion so TJ's entire spine looks more rounded this way and why we're doing that is we're almost presetting impact okay so we're going to get back like if you look at every really highle like hitter on tour they're all in this like pretty heavy fle flexion State they look more that way at the moment of the strike as opposed to as opposed to that way exactly exactly so we're kind of in a way presetting impact okay at setup in the spine got it okay there you go beautiful so the other thing that we're going to do like throughout the course of the the movement here like the arms are going to lift at some point like if you fire them what's that make your spine do does it go into more of a flexion state or more of an extension State I mean the more that I lift them the more they're going to extend that's exactly right and if you toss the arms and then dropped now it's full extension full extension full extension okay and it's not because I'm trying to go into spine extension it's because the act of squatting like dropping properly y makes my like my whole back chain my spine go into more extension there you go and and the t-spine goes into more extension because the arms are lifting if the arms left I look more this way so this is extension and if I drop I'm going into a bit more extension all right so actually the back swing those those forces are pulling the spine into some extension yes so if we set up already extended you don't have room we don't have that ability exactly so what you've done is you subtracted your ability to go into extension because you're already there it's like if I'm driving long and I'm in second gear and the passenger goes shift to second gear you have no no you can't move yeah yeah yeah so it immobilizes you it doesn't allow you to move in certain ways all right fair enough and in that like that transitionary period like you'll see this out of like all our favorites like havland look at havland in freaking like p 3 to P5 watch his spine it's like it's going to go from some extension to fle so he sets up in quite a bit of this like he looks this way set up he and then from like look at his spine here and look at his spine at P5 ah interesting big drop the arms lift so we're setting up in a way that makes that fraking possible sure like that we we need that sure so like so like havlin doing this is intentional right cuz now he's got some Mobility to actually move yep yep so if I if if I'm in this like heavy like flexion State here and then I go movement drop yep there's the spine extension that we want the appropr that's such a good look so let's do this now cuz and and go ahead and set up and I'll just like recap here CU we got three main topics I want to see like almost to the threshold of of um scat protraction it's going to make this round more for you got it okay let's make sure that we're in quite a bit of pelvic posterior tilt good so loads of drop there and then move away from it more so you can be in more diving board posture so you're more into the toes okay now you look like freaking hbling holy cow that doesn't that doesn't look like what it feels like yeah okay so now go ahead and hit one with plenty of drop in that transitionary phase and just flush one out for us super cool really cool so again we want to two things in in in setting up we want the ability to move in certain ways so that I can shift from second to third gear go figure um and we also want the ability to like subtract all the stuff that we don't want to do I don't want to start in the heels and then have no ability to move in the heels sure I have all the ability in the world to move into the toes because of pelvic extension interesting early right like this guy doesn't look right no he doesn't this guy does yes he does right just again ey test you're like that one looks better than that one just from an athletic perspective screw plane who cares about where the golf club swinging just look at people move and if you do that like your eye test on the driving range if you just put like next time you go to the range just put your bag down and just watch the range and just initial like gut reaction on like every single person that you see you'll go that guy looks like a dork o he kind of looks nice nope nope yo yeah M and then try try to explain to yourself why you just stumble all over yourself it's eye test it's like oh you can just tell that guy's moving right yeah yeah a lot of it is like Rhythm based but what it is is like we're seeing movement and the sequence of that movement the ability to move in certain places in space it's like it's just a response and an alien could see it they go oh tiger looks good yeah for sure right yeah yeah okay so set up properly just through those three basic principles it will allow you to move one in a really healthy way but you'll also be able to like swing the fraking golf club and it feels nice and you can do the things that you have always wanted to do in your golf swing just based on how you set up keep us posted comment below I love that that's my favorite that's going to be our outro from now on\n",
      "well today we get to talk about something fun we're going to actually tell you don't lift the arms in the back swing what I think just a good like General kind of understanding where we're going to go with this where we're going to try to go with this okay is uh Force Direction in the arms in the arms got it okay so uh first general question do the arms swing up and down do they actually do that well that's that's a complicated answer I think right I think that's one that's probably going to have a lot of debate to it um I think when I was taught as a kid I I was taught that they swing more up and down right through shoulder flexion and extension that sort of deal um but now I'm not so sure okay so here's the the operative word is force Direction okay Force Direction okay so let's just look at like certain certain uh swinging mechanisms MH so if you're sitting in a swing set and you go Riley push me right yeah okay which direction do I initially push you that way that way so we would call it like kind of a horizontal Vector I'm pushing in that direction level to the ground and when you start off you get chugging and you're going this way but then pretty soon which direction do you start going up you start going up uhhuh oh interesting so if I go or like if I'm pushing you and it's kind of this like casual will push and you're kind of swinging and you're like this is all well and good but I want to go higher Riley MH right you'll say higher higher right like every little kid's like higher Dad yep and then where does Dad push do they do this all of a sudden no they just push harder in that same direction correct and eventually where does the kid go further up further up because right above dad is the lever or the fulcrum yes ah Force Direction okay okay so is this shoulder flexion just that act yeah right yes it is is this shoulder flexion it is yeah so it's all shoulder flexion but most people go shoulder flexion is arm lift and they're wrong they're right and wrong they're right and right understand it's dependent upon where they deem they need to send the force if they think they need a longer back swing typically I got to lift up here more okay so this is like a massive like in in my humble opinion this is not debatable okay because if we want like a a more stable Club face so what is that it's a it's a club face that doesn't rotate as hard through the strike right so it stays stays more or less Square here so what TJ is showing yeah and square to what Square to the path you're swinging on there you go a general plane or path yeah Square yeah right yep yeah so the the harder that is rotating we would deem that us in our Academy as unstable okay okay so if you do this teach go ahead and set up to can be set up to a golf ball sure and swing the golf club up and it doesn't need to be crazy exaggerated but send force in the arms up there you go from there the player is going to have to stop the arms in some way and the way that you did that is you created an equal and opposite force in the opposing direction or vector interesting okay so to stop the arms going up there forever I had to add a force basically down and we'll be able to see that watch this do that again but do it hard okay so it bounces up here feel it like go here and then it slightly bounces back that's the force and we see that in fascia yeah so it's bouncing back down vertical in a vertical plane because you sent it vertical so if you this active vertical Force you're going to get whether you want it or not another one that comes back down in the same direction exactly and most of the time and kind of not necessarily whether you want it or not because we'll see right players that get up here and then they just start turning they keep it up here right but in general we're going to have this like I've got to stop it at some point because my my idea is to send it up and the way to stop that is to to create another force in the opposing Direction I see okay okay so now if we're in that transitionary phase up there sure which direction is the force going now down okay and for your body cuz your body is always there to support The Swinging action of the arms hands and Club so the arms are going down what would your body have to do in order to support that rise exactly because if I just go back here and I just send energy down that's not going to be good relative to where the golf ball would be so you've got to create there you go so the space that You' got to create is based on typically we talk about it in hip extension or spine extension to create this room that now I can deliver the GOL Golf Club in here yeah that stalls out body rotation and the golf club still has force in it so what's it going to do it's going to flash so the the rate of rotation is going to go up for sure there we go so that is a map of how to swing the club of how to swing the club by the way there's some damn good players out there that play that way mhm I would argue that Jimmy Walker is that type of a player web Simpson might be that type of a player and we can see that through force in their body yep and typically what we see in force of their body like directionality of body like if we're more of an extension kind of a pattern vertical Force player the idea is we're going to send Force downward got it Justin Thomas would be one of those guys more vertical Force by the way no freaking hate on those dudes those guys are freaking unreal I ain't on tour they kick my ass all up and down they're great right we're just talking about General Maps okay and if you want to get into this more of like a rotational stable face kind of a dude mhm we've got to better understand options for Force Direction okay which is also freaking awesome because it's Dynamic forces are Dynamic okay like when I'm saying Force I'm saying where are we moving sure okay so let's get back to this like swing set idea let's do it so the arms are the chains all right okay go ahead and set up to the golf golf ball okay send the golf club at my shin send Force here there you go okay now set up again turn towards the camera don't do anything with the arms okay now if you sent the arms and you can pump them too like if the arms came back kind of underneath you and then you set sent force in the club head like the center mass of the club at the camera oh that was actually really cool I didn't expect that to happen yeah you feel stuff yeah and you see like also what's cool like that lead heel like flashes away cuz like you're you you tap into spiral L immediately you're not even thinking about spiral line it's Force Direction so so by trying to send the club at that camera yep here's the lever like we have multiple levers there's a lever here there's a lever there there's a lever there it's any joint is a lever MH okay so what you just did is the center mass of the club you sent that way but this is Le it's not going to just keep going eventually this is The Swinging point with enough force it did pop up but the force Direction is not here it's not up it's there it's very very level that's okay so let's just hit one we'll just start with this idea sure so your your job your midline right now is pointing here your chest needs to rotate the midline away so it points more towards the camera and once it does that you send Force at the camera through the club head system there you go go ahead and hit one at like 60% beautiful look right there midline Force excellent EX excellent okay so now let's talk this forward swing so we in your in your mind's eye the force got sent here right it's not sent there it's sent there got it well we would like the force then to be sent back forward again okay and this shoulder complex is super interesting because it can do a lot of things okay if I go into shoulder flexion I can go right back down into extension of the shoulder sure but we don't need to do that if we have a different m match up okay so the first match up if I have this like vertical Force vertical Force right I'm running the arms down I've got a stand to create room correct well if I go turn horizontal Force here so I sent Force away from here if I drop like think of especially in my spine just in general my spine's on this angle if I drop so I'm going into more hip flexion this way uhuh here my spine starts to move it starts to move in this direction yeah starts to change incline a little bit for sure that's exactly L right and perpendicular to that to my spine in general if I'm dropping what all of a sudden is perpendicular to my spine the golf ball okay exactly interesting so if this arm gets sent boom back away so it's in shoulder flexion as I drop now I can I don't have to send Force down I don't have to go into extension of the shoulder anymore instead I can go straight into AB duction this hit okay which force direction is that going that's that's level again that's level again so it's not this vertical idea so instead of extension flexion like and that probably will happen a little bit right here's what you're saying but um it's more of yes so so AB duction yes so AB just so like we're defining things AB duction is away from you a d add duction is into got it okay so in the hit once we've gone midline turn send Force away MH now I'm dropping but see I'm not doing anything with my arms yet they're just floating in space back here the lead arm will AB duct as the trail arm ad ducts abduct goes across there you go and that's the hit ah so now we start to look more like if I've got an Axe and I'm hitting a like trying to axe a tree or I have a sledgehammer trying to freaking Hammer a wall boom see the force Direction in your mind's eye you're sending Force this way so to get the golf Club down here all we need is to drop more so that yeah so see how TJ spine now is on this angle yep so perpendicular angle is here well guess what's down there interesting okay map map okay okay so let's hit one at like 60% but we're going to feel midline turn away okay know the force direction away once that once that Golf Club gets sent away you're going to drop and level hit the arms go for for that's so good just do that all buffed off like 60% or but with that map got to focus here uhhuh good better no better and what this is how you lower the rate the the rate of rotation in in the club cuz if I'm throwing Force here the golf club's going to continue to work forward so if this is going down right and I stand to create that room well eventually it's going to go forward I can't support that cuz I'm done rotating right so there goes the club that's interesting so the rotation allows you to support the golf club a little bit right and if we ditch it all immediately we don't we're not able to do that anymore exactly and this is what's interesting too we work with a lot of players obviously and like I think players watch our Channel or Instagram or whatever and they're like oh dude it's a rotational swing I need to rotate more and how much did you think about rotating towards the target zero yeah absolutely freaking zero you will rotate if you're if you're half an athlete you're going to rotate because like think of this direction again if there's this like say it's a uh I've just got a wall here and I wanted to punch the wall so the direction in my mind I'm not going down to hit the wall I'm going that way yep so like right there te go ahead and ball up your fist over there on the right side just pump me how much did you think about turning none again but but I'm turning you're fully rotated yeah so that's B like the rotation just happens due to the intention of where I'm trying to send the force exactly and the body is always there to just support The Swinging action of the arms so it's playing a supportive role rather than this active role of like rotate rotate rotate like how like If I Had a Hammer and I just go oh man it's like the dumbest like kind of kind of blowing my mind a little bit cuz even even kind of when I when I started learning this system I was I thought the same thing I was like I'm learning a rotational system right I'm trying to learn how to rotate my body but kind of how we just described it like the body is going to respond to our directionality of the arms yes that's a whole different map at least in my mind of at least we're to direct intention even our stupid terms in golf there's a back swing and then there's a down swing it's not a back swing and a forward swing nobody ever says that it goes back and then down like oh yeah interesting it's just we set ourselves up for failure just with these words which create Ms Right interesting so do that again so this is what's kind of fun too cuz there's just we just have Force direction map here and body supports it sure hit one like I don't know you got seven iron right yep okay hit one 140 140 140 yards just flushed out but you just know Force direction we got turn level there you go now now we're going to drop and forward direction of the arms they don't go down at all you drop and move them forward now that's this is cool thin heavy pure heavy as heavy heavy as okay so what does that tell you about the force direction of the arms actually probably two down there you go so we need more forward so and that's what I felt with the last one as well like when I actually felt this like kind of active forward level hit uhuh that lined everything lined everything up so even though it's it's a 140 yard shot we're taking some off of it just think of it as like if you had a quaky right here and an axe in your hand right an aspen Tre so a little bitty thing and a big heavy axe you're not going ripping if you want to chip it right right you're just tapping like there's the hit but that's a forward Direction even if you're trying to hit down here you're not trying to throw the axe down you're still trying to throw the axe forward there you go interesting yeah it's a forward Vector changes the intention so last one I got I got in here yep and this one we're going to that's exactly right and look how stable that b move at all yes and that's probably the easiest way for anyone to get their way around a golf course like dude exactly and so like I mean you if you're going to be like really fairly accomplished in this game you do not play golf stock stock stock stock stock same energy no cuz you're play in different wind conditions and all kinds of stuff like you're going to sometime if you hit let's say you're a beast and you hit 7 iron 180 but it's into the fan 30 m hour uh you're going go well I guess I'll hit six iron just rip it still you're going to lose the ball you'll lose the ball sure you've got to be able to like go okay it's into the fan by 30 m hourish and go s iron from like 150 and still control the face if you have this downward path up to give it room boom and the face is doing this like have a fun day the harder you swing at it the more it rotates at that point right the because the harder you throw a vertical Force down yep the more the face is going to rotate the more you're going to extend up yep so you're just handcuffed you're handcuffed so so in this way like if Our intention with regardless of whatever shot is more or less a level hit yep you can control whatever energy put you put whatever you want into it basically so watch this here now we're having fun no we know Force Direction just hit one stock NOW St but you better damn well flush one all right yes sir but we know Force Direction we've got good maps Bo forward beautiful good 175 185 s iron flush but what's awesome did you lose any stability in either of those last two shots that you no I mean both of those balls didn't move a lick they're right over the top of one so like it's so easy to contr the instrument when you manage your Force Direction huh and that's just just a completely different intention for most people it's a totally different intention you also understand that yeah the arms are going to swing up just like a swing set will but to move somebody in this vertical Direction you don't just Huck them up there you still push them in a certain direction which is level y it's a level Force back it's a level Force forward and really in the forward swing we're not even talking at all about lowering it all we're talking about pure ab and adduction only the guys that drop the most the way that we get down to the ball is the drop is the drop because the more that I drop from this like neutral to kind of recap here like if I'm in neutral standing position my spine is generally tall the more that I drop my booty so my pelvis drops going into more hip flexion yep see the angle that my spine starts to get at exactly yeah it goes forward so perpendicular to that is where the golf ball would be so I don't have to go down anymore I can purely go forward interesting matchups matchups Force Direction change your freaking mindset and where you're sending force all of a sudden you get those ones heck yeah dude heck yeah baby nice you look good you look good too man I think there's going to be a number of questions on this video right so yeah I would anticipate there's going to be a heck of a lot like you know what's actually making that move D like right now it's just identifying directionality of movement is really the whole idea of this video and yeah I mean there's a there's a million different ways to feel it MH based on what we're describing here ask the questions you know us we answer them all let's hit flushies let's do it hey guys thanks so much for watching that video we've got a golf school coming up March 13th through the 15th if you've ever wanted to get to know the elite golf school system this would be a great way to do so Whirlwind Golf Club link is in the bio to register spots are very very limited nine spots total so get there [Music] quick\n",
      "we get to talk about something really fun today and that point is shallowing is stupid so stupid so stupid let's go the the reason that I hate these these terms is you can interpret them in all kinds of different ways that's the that's the problem is the interpretations veryy widely exactly so like when we're coaching someone uh whether it's virtual or in person if I just hold a series of let's say five individuals coaching coaching coach and then I go shallow it and then this person shallow it like all five of them I'm going to see five different iterations of that 100% yeah so on its own it's the dumbest freaking thing in the world yeah so get your weight to your left side okay or like posting yep right shallowing like all this stuff just drives me nuts cuz it's just like every body interprets this idea in a different way I think they're terms that make sense to the coach saying them but the problem is is how do we develop terminology that makes sense to every single person watching these videos I think that's the challenge here yes and shallowing probably isn't doing it for a lot of people exactly so te let's do this again okay okay and let's just swing it back to about half halfway back P3 again okay great there's some amount of lead side bent these ribs are closer together than these ribs are right now like it's very easy to see that go ahead and set up and just hug the club for us if you could so right now we'd be in in relatively neutral spine angle actually TJ if you could just face the screen this way and we can see this really easily from right here this is very neutral relatively neutral okay now let's do this TJ let's just um stand at about a 45° angle out in that corner good and show us about halfway back now there you go so from right here we can see from TJ c-spine working through here there's a small amount of Bend right here okay if you kept turning a bit more we'd see more and more Bend there you go and now in transition we would drop and the look at where the bend just went now it bounced out can you just go back and forth between those two there to there there you go see this snake like look and all this Bend guys is happening in here it's between his scaps cuz this is all very very stable down in here there's not a whole lot of Bend in here go to there freeze good stable stable stable now it starts to bend this is where the bend actually happens that is the main shallower so let's keep that in mind keep that map go ahead and set up again about halfway back or so to P3 and about at P3 we'll see quite a bit of turn here in TJ and if he keeps going now swing it up and then back into that same look either there now that's what made the golf club fall into that space it's like the main like if we want to use this term of the center of mass of the club falling under the plane that's what we're talking about with shallowing but most people that we see they're trying to do something in the lead arm they're trying to scap retract in the trail arm to just shove the club back here and that's a no no we'll also see like way too much funky stuff in the hands to try to like show this massive shallow sure and it's a problem because like there's these new terms that just come out that are just sexy terms and so people just want to run through that sexy Ville as much as they possibly can and they'll just overdo stuff and you're throwing forces like too much force in certain like structures blah blah blah blah blah so a lot of this stuff is fairly subtle and it should happen because not because I'm reorganizing like all the arms or all the hands and like doing big stuff there it's just because I'm like clunking like from one side to the other in the pit line mhm to shallow the center mass of the club yeah okay the other very interesting thing here do that one more time for us if you could about halfway back or so okay and about P3 so a little bit further there you go hands are here okay I'm just curious on this show from P3 now back to P5 good they're still in relatively the same space and sometimes we'll see this like reverse slot where the hands are actually out here a little bit more this is like anti- shallow that most people would think that's over the top yes that the hands would go so right here at P3 this would kind of bounce up and then they'd work like out in the space just a little bit yep that's still okay because now TJ's arm structure is still on his anterior it's in front of him the center mass of the club might be on his posterior mhm okay so we could deem that shallowing but not this sure okay and all that happens just because of the right amount of side bin and it doesn't need to be a lot sure it's the appropriate amount got it okay so let's go P3 P5 hit beautiful now when I say hit what goes through your brain well um this has changed a little bit in the last few weeks uh okay before it it kind of was kind of motor the chest through okay and let that club kind of go through a little late okay um and now I'm actually kind of trying to actively fire my arms across in that hit phas yes and a lot of that like we've talked about that some but then recently and we'll we'll put a video out on this here really soon uh with hack motion it's showing how early TJ can unload the golf club and unload the golf club is this active hit in the arms yep and again what we prefer to see is more of an AB and AD action to hit but also in the handle you can let the center of mass of the club just go yes right to feel more like this is an extension this lead hand goes into extension to unload the club so like do you even feel like you're rotating for you a ton through the hit not a ton I know it's there uh and it's supporting the action that I'm making with the arms but it really does feel like I'm kind of actively throwing These Arms across a little bit yes exactly exactly and you do such a good job in this transitionary phase in just organizing the club that it's here and then good body action to get it in here now te don't even rotate your chest in your mind and just thump one with the arms there you go like see how supportive the chest and pelvis and Spine and all that stuff this Bain stuff in the body supports the swinging Act of the of the arms so the point of this too is we don't just keep like shoving this thing back here back here back here back here back here and never let it go right that's another just like does not happen with the best players in the world they actively hit with the arms right and I mean if you're continuing to try to sh shallow it to the point where it's like this is unreasonable now you're going to have a really difficult time in the hit yeah okay I think I think the whole purpose of any shallowing Force right is to to load up the fascia in a way where it wants to snap back down across you sort of as its own accord right so that's the whole goal is to actually energize the arms so that they can fire and hit yep um so yeah it's just counterintuitive to sort of leave it back there and just yeah yeah exactly and and again like we're not speaking to feels right now no yeah certain players need that feel because they're so active in like lowering this lead arm right and see that all the time which is why a lot of our videos that we've put in the past are going to help a lot of people because sure you know they they need to feel like this goes a lot later they need to feel like that happens very very late yep um but it's not what happens in actuality and if some players take that to an extreme they're going to have some problems yes and a lot of the the folks that were fortunate enough to coach it they will put themselves put themselves in that box MH of like okay I I see rotation so that means I need to shallow it a ton and d d and they'll just overcook everything right and like pretty soon they just overseason their meal to the point where it tastes horrible yeah right and you need the right amount of seasoning so that it it tastes good right and feels good yes right and so like again what actually happens is does the center of mass shallow in a lot of players yeah it does but you don't see like a ton and a lot of like patterns why you see a ton Anders like leino or nean they have a ton side bent right and it doesn't it's still a healthy pattern like you never hear like Le trino talk about like back problems right he's he's fine he just has a lot of this yep well if I did a lot of that where would that Golf Club go continue shallowing and shallowing so we see this bigger larger move out of that type of a player than we would see out of like an Adam Scott with a small amount of side bent right but we still see a little bit moves in the space because we're trading from lead side Bend to Trail side Bend and that's the main Center of mass shallower but just that little bit is probably good for most people like just a little bit of bump here just to get that club working more in that space instead of this space and then even when you move it into that space don't be afraid to just hit that's the whole point of moving it into that space yeah exactly so that now you can go and hit these freaking like thumpy ones that feel great okay so let's see one that's like this will be super easy to just kind of move in this in the space we've got this like halfway back know how the ribs are are moving to create side Bend and control the golf club and then you just hit with the arms they fire beautiful so there's a little three-piece exercise to just help you with a better understanding of shallowing right but now let's see it in one motion but kind of 60% and we'll just kind of work through those three phases I think I'm going to go even slower so I can really yep love it that's so good God that feels good that feels feels right it's so stable through here too yeah you just feel it forever and the reason that TJ can do that like if you want to limit shaft tumble you need to hit earlier right which is really cool because if you get it in here eventually like you got to get it going I can't just like keep turning turning turning like extension finally will force this to go but it shoots the handle out to the right and then there goes the golf club and it'll tumble and you're like well dude I'm just trying to turn to stabilize it that's it um that that's a comment that we see very very often when we make a post or a video about shallowing forces yep as I'll see I'll see almost like a frustrated exasperated comment from someone that's like shallowing ruined my game like and we go yeah absolutely we know it can if it's t if the SE steak is over seasoned right exactly if once you get the club in here you don't understand that that's just a a temporary force uh before we hit across with the arms yep if you don't understand that then then you're done like we would actually like to see this and you see this out of like some of our favorite players like Brooks kka Lee Westwood uh even Hogan this lead arm like once it's in here as this as they're going forward this arm comes off yes and we'll see all this space happen like in here where TJ's showing P5 it's like across to load this posterior arm line but again to your point fasion lines that are loaded we're loading them in certain ways so that now I can fire off of that so this lead arm should come off to hit that's the hit see all that space yeah so when you're doing these little exercises of like okay A little lead side bend the shaft's kind of tall now as it bounces up and I trade into a little bit of like c-spine and top portion of of t-spine oh there's the club and as you of course you can keep turning but for a lot of our players I mean so many players that we coach that they're like dude I don't even feel like I'm turning forward anymore well yeah because you overcooked it to the point where it's unreasonable and so you can just go thump exactly okay let's hit one more a little bit firmer a little bit firmer just through those three phases in your golf swing but we're really looking for this ability to hit me remind myself of the phases real quick there boom beautiful just a good thump that's just stupid good want try that one again a little toy a little toy and it's a little late with the arms yeah that's cuz it feels like that a little bit I kind of get that way sometimes exactly so you're just into five and then you're just hitting with the arms the chest will respond it's not like you're not going to turn M like really if you have like half a strand of freaking athletic DNA you're going to turn to finish for sure like I mean it it's going to happen if you put any force in that direction this is going to play a supportive role yes it'll motor in turn for you mhm that's completely fine yeah okay so a lot of different kind of sidecar topics in this discussion but the whole point is to better understand like why the center of mass of the golf club Falls underneath the plane with a lot of really high level players and and there's a lot of stuff out there like lowering the arms create shallowing no you don't like cuz if you if you just lower the arms you got all the force going down and you got to create extension earlier that's where early extension comes from we've talked about that in in another video yeah right so again just shallowing the term shallowing on its own it it's it's left up to the user to interpret in their way of how to move it in there and most people just overcook stuff and do stuff that really doesn't like make any sense to like structuring or support or speed or anything that would make any athletic sense and just better understanding like the spine and the ribs are really what influences that little bit of like movement that we see at a high level players yes is the map that we want players to get into so that now they can go ahead and hit and the body plays that support system to the arms hands and Club that's what we're looking for that's the easy map yes sir shallowing stupid just do it the right just do it the right way exactly let's go baby turkey [Music] turkey [Music] he\n",
      "today we're talking about the main system of the golf swing let's get cracking yes sir okay so first off describing and understanding what the main system is is important so we've got the humorous both arms okay both scaps okay and the scapula te turn around for us good they're the wings right back here okay TJ's got a really nice set of scaps so you can really see them they're right in here you're welcome man I I like them they're really beautiful scraps okay and then we've got the spine the whole spine okay so from right up here in C sepine going all the way down here okay then we got pelvis and we got ribs okay so so humorous scap spine ribs pelvis main system got it main system system like it okay great so how that all generally moves is important and let's go from like a distal look and then start to work our our way into proximal so humorous first yep distal is like think of the term distance for this away from you and then proximal is closest to your like Center of mass as a person got it so I'm talking about these suckers okay okay cuz we can move them in space in a lot of different ways okay we could lift okay we can make them go side to side side we can rotate them okay we can do a lot of different things with them sure the active stuff that we would like the arms to do is a small amount of I'm not even going to say Lift because we think of lift as like going straight up okay th this shoulder flexion is that action where we're going that this is moving away from my ribs M yep so if you just sent energy at me there you go that's the act that we're looking for in the arms and again arms okay not arms got it arms okay beautiful when you do that what does that make the scaps do if you did that with both arms what what do the scaps do uh they protract and maybe elevate a little bit yep mostly mostly protract exactly cuz they're going like out away from you this way exactly so think of protraction as like bear hug mode right retraction would be this way so he's definitely not retracting as that's happening at all yeah couldn't do that can't do that right they protract a little bit exactly exactly so they'll do that because the arms are sent sending energy this direction got it okay now if we do that again do that same act again that ain't golf swing no doesn't look like golf swing no so we need something to happen to make that look like golf swing what do we need to have happen what do you what are we missing like the big the big map I mean I'd say generally it's probably uh rib rotation there you go and maybe a little bit of rib Bend as well but rotation to get the arms going this way exactly just the main map right here is just okay can I move the arms that way but we still need this act so what do you need the ribs to do there you go so if you just did this teach just let the arms kind of hang on your chest okay just turn the ribs that way good excellent now can you do the same thing now we're looking more golfy now we're looking more golfy Yep exactly exactly okay now let's just do the exact same thing that direction because we want the arms okay to fire towards the target so right now the camera is the target okay so let's go ahead and turn the ribs and then fire the arms beautiful beautiful that's excellent okay so let's grab a stick now okay okay we're not going to talk about the pelvis at all yet okay and let's go ahead and set up like we're going to hit one we're not going to hit a ball yet but what I want you to do is we're going to freeze like lock this out lock these guys out so there's like no movement these are rigid the legs and the hands so from the elbow down into here fir okay all we're going to do to start off rib rotation and then fire the arms in the direction that they should be moving boom there you go good okay now let's go the other way way let's go ahead and set up to the golf ball okay and now let's go forward side so again legs don't do Jack you're just turning your ribs turning your ribs and then firing the arms towards the target there you go excellent let's go ahead and hit one with just that map so we're here turn fire turn fire good good excellent okay now the we'll we'll just call this like the thumpy EX SS this because it is thumpy it is definitely thumpy okay and we'll have especially like Juniors that I personally work with this is one of the go-tos that I want players to to have like we got to have that kind of a map that kind of a pattern because there's plenty of hit mhm okay and there's plenty of like feeling of rotation in here but it's not in here agreed okay so let's add one little item this is very much mirror esque okay what's happening over here feels like the same thing's happening over here we're just going to throw in an amount of drop in the pelvis in between both of those phases okay so we're not we're not going to start rotating the pelvis nope we're just going to throw in drop drop okay drop exactly so see if I understand that right so we're going to go D rotation still trying to kind of keep these legs still as I do this yep yep send the arms yep and as I send the arms I'm G to drop yep exactly so it's like turn fire the arms drop turn fire the arms that's it and you just lock out those legs like they're not doing anything they're just like frozen stability stability stability down here yep turn fire drop turn fire good okay excellent okay now it doesn't necessarily feel or seem like totally golffy because most people in their in their idea of like golf swing is like this big full finish there's this big back swing kind of stuff let's do the same exact map right there these are locked out okay your hands are locked out turn fire drop turn fire good good excellent okay now we were kind of talking a little bit about like the arms and what they can do mhm okay so in the back swing there's this act okay okay so if I'm going turn and now I've got this like shoulder flexion to send the arms back and Away now as I drop once they're back there good now the arms will feel like they just go right across that ad and ab duction yep exactly they just fire across they don't fire down anymore so the thump act and we talk about this a lot but this is such an important like matchup in players Minds is from here the arms don't act actively work down cuz if I move the arms actively down then the pelvis has to elevate exactly exactly so when we think about like a hitting pattern if I have an axe in a tree right I'm sure not going to send Force down here and then Elevate the pelvis to hit that tree I'm probably again half a stranded DNA of athleticism I'm going to probably step turn and send the arms this direction so they're they're across even if I wanted to hit instead of like the middle of the tree I'm going to hit the base of the tree I'm still going to do the same thing with them going across they're not going to actively lower got it so we need to teach ourselves that even though there's a pebble down here that I want to hit and the arms are all the way up here it's not sending energy this way it's sending Energy across there you go that's more the hit okay there you go so the pelvis pelvis is main job to match that action up with the arms is to drop to support that move so we got turn toss drop and the arms go across there you go awesome now thin it like that one there you go yeah that's it and this is where a lot of people like we'll post stuff on pelvic drop and because people don't understand the match up with the arms the ribs or any of that other stuff then they go well I'm just going to Fat it every time yeah you're right cuz if I drop and send Force down no way I'm going to hit that ball I drop and send Force Level forward exactly exactly so that was cool cuz you sent the arms forward we just need enough drop to support that there we go Thump Thump house yeah and that's why we call it the thumpy exercise because you just heard the yeah I owned it like sound right and you feel it too like it's this heavy heavy hit MH okay so the other cool thing when we're talking about now like this is kind of an intricacy in all this this map when a player drops the pelvis so let's let's say that I'm in a squat wreck here and I'm just kind of in in normal standing position yes as I drop the pelvis my entire spine starts to go into more extension it does yes so this would be a really bad squat pattern right I'm going to blow up every disc in my back not supportive so when we're dropping it's not this drop the drop is this way and you'll you'll feel it like elongate the spine you'll definitely feel it in in like the middle of your spine right in the t-spine area sure okay and what that will do as well is as the arms are swinging away and I drop the scaps Elevate slightly because of that and the scaps are cool because they just like float on the ribs so scap elevation is this and it's just because of the directionality of the force that I'm sending if I turn and I send Force this way they protract they're protracting actively because of the arm action as I drop the pelvis there goes the there goes the spine but now the scaps start to elevate slightly because of that and this is like massive tissue load but we're talking about bones right now and where they're moving in space really but that pelvic drop we just need a better idea of what's actively happening what's actively happening is the pelvis is lowering and what actively happens too is then the spine starts to go in a proper amount of extension okay especially in the midback and the scaps passively go into a little bit of elevation so by no means am I saying that we're like actively elevating them it's that when I go here and the arms send away the scaps protract as I drop with that there you go you'll feel all this stuff load up and by the way like all the proper amount of side bin most likely is going to happen because of that action okay okay so when you do this te I'd love to see again we're locked out here we're not doing anything in the extremities okay okay but we're going to turn fire and once you fire you're going to drop and you'll feel that entire spine elongate good and then from there now you're good you just can fire these suckers across and that becomes the hit okay beautiful and you'll notice te like in his mock reps he'll drop in and then these arms just almost like go across the chest this is typically a great mock rep for most players yep because again like you are going to turn and this is kind of the proof go go throw that club down for me if you could and then just face the camera like just here in posture good and then just ball up your fist over here on your right side okay now hit me fairly firm hard okay good now where were you generally focused in the hand okay in the hand M did you turn I'm facing facing that way right now about 90° yeah okay so the idea here wasn't turn turn turn turn and just pull on this the idea here is to fire this across but I mean again half a strand to athletic DNA am I going to do this no and I've never gone ball up a fist and punch me and somebody goes like it doesn't happen because of the in ality of where you're directing Force the rotation happens as a result of it and the and the the purpose of this is to better understand support systems MH this is the support system support system of the arms we want to hit with the arms they're the main speed Yep they're also the main Precision if we're moving force in a good way in a proper manner you can gain more and more Precision because of that but the idea here folks is like you don't need to go turn fire the arms drop and then just turn and leave these suers behind there's a drop and then fire if you do that and just this idea of like this is the thump this will support yes most often like very rarely do I ever have to go oh dude your arms are out RAC and we need to speed this up like I actually don't know if I've ever said that to a student sure right there might be a drive phase to keep going to finish or something like that and there might there might be all this you know lowering and arm rot there might be all that right but exactly right it's a different pattern it's a different you rarely see person direct Force the right way and their body doesn't respond may actually not happenly so this match up which again we talk about this quite a bit in a lot of our especially our recent videos is the matchup is we want this across feeling of the arms and the hit and the match up to that is pelvic drop so I can do that so if you're dropping and these are going here that's the hit and you will turn it's just if I'm lowering this this elevates and then the spine when is a different topic we it's got to like if I'm lowering the golf club is going to pitch over and late ex late extension until in the spine is a shallowing man exercise to move the golf club in that space and so that's why we won't see a lot of rib or thoracic rotation through the hit it's just because the the map of force is wrong wrong okay exactly okay so let's do that again te but again we just have this idea of like the legs are just St stable you're not doing anything with the legs you're not doing anything with the hands this is just the thumper exercise turn Force drop Force good and let's see it in one motion now okay again no movement in the legs they're just stable think I forget that sometimes I mean yeah play golf with that and obviously obviously a viewer watching that my legs moved there um I I think the intentionality to keep them more stable just makes sure they don't go do anything crazy right but they responded to the movement that my chest was making which is interesting and if you do it yeah exactly because there's so much force that's it just leaks it leaks through tissue in your body if you do that with less energy you'll be able to stay stable sure so let's hit one like what you got eight iron or seven iron or something seven yeah yeah hit this 100 yards in the air okay but it's still thumpy there you go okay so the thump is this main system yep how the humorous so that doesn't that doesn't change regardless of if I'm trying to hit this 200 or 100 right exactly so same system all of a sudden you'll see all these other parts of the body sort of respond yeah but the main system is that thumpy yeah and this is what we're getting at folks here like what we're describing like to be honest the reason that we make these videos like our mission and infatuation is like we make a video you put these ideas in to your system of movement or your gossing whatever you want to call it and you hit better shots yes okay like that's what we're infatuated with like if if it doesn't happen we want to hear that and like see a pattern and like oh I see what you're trying to do and like help you with that map too so that oh I'm thumped out yes right what we see most players do is they screw up this main system because they just have the a wrong understanding of what's going on in this main system it it would be great to like okay the arms are working well the body's supporting that okay once that gets done now what am I doing in my hands to load and organize the club like that's simple stuff same thing with the feet and the legs like the problem is is that if people don't have the right intentionality of the main system then you can spend all your time on matchups but you're not going to get any better which is what we see out of most DS right is like there's just all this like stuff stuck in the mud yeah exactly and we're just messing around with like salt and pepper and we didn't even buy our steak yet yes like dude get your main course done like you need this stuff operating well and then you can go like okay well I would like to have the face a little more shut because I want to release it in XYZ like stuff makes a little bit more sense like um a lot of people see a move that we're describing and just beat their head into a wall trying to do it and they're like why doesn't it look like well probably because the intentionality from the get-go is wrong how you're setting up could be wrong how you how you're doing these little basic exercises could be wrong and then you're screwed dude like totally and like to that point the basic exercises aren't just for beginners no they're for everyone they're for everybody if I if I wasn't to do these on on a regular basis my swing wouldn't look the way it looks that's exactly right and and for for me right I coach this stuff all the time and like some of the best training that I do is when I'm coaching because I'm showing but then even if I'm getting ready for a tournament or round of golf I still allocate 5 10 reps of like some exercise like this that gets me right like a I feel feel stuff and then I can like mess around with some other stuff if I'm like overcutting it for a day I can mess with like my hands and stuff but that's way later I got to get the basics down MH that's a necklace quote like fundamentals Jack why are you the best player in the world because I treat myself like a beginner every single day MH so like you never outwork like this basic stuff we have to get back to Baseline so that you feel good athletically okay let's see one more okay just a good heavy Thumper but it's the map right the legs are stable the hands aren't doing jack you just know Force Direction you know how this whole system is working and execute on that system Thumpers hit freaking Thumpers you said something uh really interesting earlier about um you know when when players we want players to hit better golf shots um and the feedback that you provide in the comments helps us to understand whether the language that we are using is actually helping you and this is why our videos are going to get better and better and better over time so please comment and ask whatever questions you have it helps make us better helps make you better 100% 100%\n",
      "up te what up dude pretty excited cuz today we get to talk about how to release the golf club let's go let's go we're talking hand things Forum things yes sir Club face things mhm we're talking release yes yeah one of our I'm very curious about it and one of our most um asked for topics to kind of dive deeper into sure absolutely I think what would be great is you know if you're familiar with our Channel or it's the first time you've ever watched us we we coach in this systems based approach meaning that systems have bookends to them where there's space in here that would be adequate right like this is where we want to be and then if you run out of that book end you're in fville right again it's more difficult to hit good shots over here um and then the same thing on this end so I think what would be nice is to maybe explain both of those bookins okay and then players can decide based on their own preferences what they need because of body movement sure what they need for speed what they need for precision they can like pick what type of release pattern is going to match best for them so why don't we start it um this like almost in a way kind of fully un unloaded phase or area which is um really about like so p7 is impact p8 is where the shaft gets leveled to the ground on the other side yes exactly and then if we even go like one step further where the the golf club the shaft goes out of the ribs on this side I mean the sexy thing that everybody talks about especially on social media is almost the club face pointing back at the camera yeah all right let's start here okay let's please do that because I'm curious sure well I want to hear your thoughts too te like I know you've been studying this stuff a lot especially like in release M so not every high level player throughout the course of history has done that and then if we go one step further this yes yeah very few have in history done that the great players I agree Okay Age like you see more of a release if you could like through those ribs again where the the toe is rotating beautiful that way more like we see like the Leading Edge is right in here and the toe is pointing on the on the plane line rather than the face pointing on the plane line and when you're talking like rate of rotation everybody has this rate of rotation simply means is how aggressively is the face rotating through the through the Impact Zone and you know now we're talking about like well low rate of rotation is a really good thing it can be it can be for sure it can be catastrophic as well sure if implemented poorly so you don't have to have this sexy look of the face pointing back towards the camera once like it goes through the rips like not a necessity yeah and in fact we coach this yours doesn't neither does mine yeah well I I I try like hell to make do it but it doesn't do it but when we're playing no it's not it's not like I'm forcing this to go that way right yeah exactly so like if you look throughout the course of history we got these great players Woods Y for the most part rotates it rotates it a bit uh you got these other guys Jimmy Walker uh rotates it even more rotates it even more John Ron through there rotates a heck of a lot right so it is not this huge necessity that we have a low rate of rotation it can be great for some folks but it can again it can like limit speed it can limit all these different items that we really need as as if we want to call ourselves golfing athletes like we want that stuff to feel good when we play agree okay so why don't we start with like that into the Spectrum so kind of the the tiger end of the spectrum exactly and by the way even though we're talking about this point in space Yep this is not necessarily going to be an active thought to get there to put the club there sure it's going to happen as a result of other forces passively because of another type of an idea so if you just swing one up to like P5 is like all the way into P5 good this is about delivery fully loaded phase from right here to do this what we'll want and by the way from here with every single player we'll have some amount of of vertical from the the center mass of the chest and the center of mass of the pelvis okay and what that's going to allow for is this lead arm to lower and as it's lowering now all the forces are going down you'd have to really go up and away to create that space there you go and now the flash out is this mhm okay so notice when you when you do that TJ if you can do that again for us so this lowers your unwinding and and rotating this there you go so if TJ from over here lowers this arm and lets it continue to go eventually the humoris is rotating like right here in the shoulder socket it is rotating this bone is going this way not because he's actively trying to make it like externally rotate but it will externally rotate for every single player on earth to some degree now how early it happens because of shoulder flexion is what we're talking about okay so for that type of player um you'd have this lowering sh flexion action and then that external rotation would happen very very early for that type of player earlier exactly and then maybe I'm getting ahead of myself but if we're bouncing to other end of the spectrum we call it like maybe hland yep right then he's got a little bit more internal for this early portion and then that'll go later yes and a lot of that is is based on the center mass of the pelvis and where it's moving so like with Rory heavier face rotation kind of a guy like with driver you'll see Rory through the strike look like that like it really goes so the center of mass of his pelvis like is as he gets into P5 or so let's take Rory vers havin at P5 cuz two different releasers from right here Rory will rotate in the center of mass of the pelvis will be further forward through the strike to unload this and so as he's rotating meaning his pivot point is further CL more bias into the lead side not all the way here but more like lead HIIT bias for Pivot Point meaning he's rotating in this phase this can lower and as it lowers the force that we get is this external rotation of the of the upper arm as he does that and that'll rotate the face a little bit more aggressively okay and so that type of a release in the hands will be more into a radial versus owner release so think of a hammer right load the hammer unload the hammer so as I kind of lower this club down with shoulder flexion or this would be extension yep um then the release is more of this idea and you want and and the player won't even have to feel this it just happens it just happens but we'll have two main like active thoughts there for that type of a player once I'm in five yep okay the the pivot point will be further lead hit bias right so as he's as he's unwinding as TJ's unwinding he's rotating here and the other active thought is this lead arm will lower and so you'll you'll have these like guys that talk about um like lowering the arms heavily like if you if you watch a bunch of Justin roses um he's talking about lowering y yep he's talking about lowering here and then as he's rotating he's in here so Justin Rose Rory both have very similar tops of Swing look there's not a whole lot of bow in this lead wrist in fact with Rory quite a bit of extension yeah interesting compared to other players sure right like havland who has a heck of a lot more bow yep exactly so that's another portion portion of the matchup for release is what type of player are you at the top also how do you grip it like moreaa weaker grip yep Bose it heavier at the top Rory stronger grip yep more radial at the top with the with the load in the hands in the wrists interesting so all this goes into release release patterns it's like all the set some of the setup in the arms and the hand and how we're holding the golf club all the way into the load M right and then how how the player pivots is really key to this too because if I pivot more like Rory where I'm up in here the tendency is going to be now I'm going to lower this and as I lower it and continue to rotate then that flashes out so te if you could let's set up uh next to it here and show us a couple like this needs to be done for release like for this to passively release we need enough energy in it for it to actually go okay so go to five for us and again the two active thoughts here are going to be lead hip pivot and Lead arm lower and just bust it through here there you go do that again roughly to five okay and go good now are you trying to rotate the arms at all or rotate the club face no no I'm not yeah so that happens because there is a rotational aspect that we're talking about in the pelvis okay and we're more lead HIIT bias there okay and go ahead and do that again from face on now if you could teach so we'll go to five and then the same map good do that again good now as the athlete do you feel the club releasing in a certain way like does it feel like it ro ro like I do feel it rotating more um CU I have a pretty good sense and awareness of of what that's doing um but yeah I do feel it rotating a little bit more but it's not like I'm sitting here trying to yes to like throw it that way exactly and so I think it would be really important like right now to discuss this and we can kind of Bounce this idea back and forth a stable release in our minds in our Maps is a player whose structure of the arms meaning the humorous bones okay are not going over one another this is like not very stable like now we're now we're act yeah exactly so that would be un exactly the other unstable release would be if I go here way too much see I'm I'm actively moving these like that's not stable either like does the golf club look like it's anywhere near neutral yeah and either to kick anyway exactly it's going to go anyway because I got to recover it late like you got we got issues now sure right and if you watch like our Instagram or you know any of like the shorts that we put up of some of our players our job as coaches is to push the intention for certain movers into one of those types of feels but what truly happens is neither one of those we want neutral yeah yeah yeah so stable simply means that the arm structure throughout the course of the Swing we're not really we're we're not messing with that yeah whether the arms lower here and I'm and I'm a lead hip bias pivot pivot kind of a player the arms are still out in front of me here and we see a ton of players like falo through history is look just like this right and then like the other type of a hit which we'll get into here is more of a lower and this Abad hit but the arm structure still is nice and sound we haven't messed a whole lot of with that right what we're talking about more is like the rotation that we see in the hands so this pronation and superation type of an act but I'm still not messing with the upper arms totally no no this is fine uhhuh from turning with it still have the golf club structured sure that's stable so rate of rotation is simply reading the rotation of the club face and how active it is Rory heck of a lot higher than havin than havin yeah but you argue with me who's the better ball Striker that's a hard one yeah that's a beer conversation right Roy's better no hain's better like that that's why that's why spectrums is so important because these guys arguably would be our bookends right havin super low RAR rotation macroy a little higher but both insanely good ball Strikers because the by our definition of stable at this point they both fit that criteria exactly exactly their arms aren't doing anything like whack and crazy especially through the hit yeah right yeah yeah exactly so let's hit a couple balls that way te if you could and you don't have to stop at five we'll just keep it going but we've got our two active thoughts which is more lead hip bias pivot okay and then the the lead arm is simply lowering when you're doing that you'll let the golf club just go feel it rotate more yeah that one kicked a bit for sure mhm yep by the way lead hip is not that I'm taking this lead hip and just driving it towards the target yeah it simply means that the Pivot Point would be in here and so I'm rotating okay yeah I think I was kind of doing that there a little bit oh do you feel that in yours okay good there you go excellent excellent so there's still rotation in a lead hit pivot right it's not not that I just sway this over here and never rotate cuz if I just keep moving this lateral there's no rotation a pivot point means that there's something rotating around that point in space and what we're doing we're going to one extreme which is a lead hip type type pivot which we see some of that right one more of those yeah one more of those so probably what you'll feel and again it's not like you're trying to flash the club but that passively happens because of an active idea and what is interesting though like um I don't I don't feel it like kick right here uhhuh it actually still feels relatively stable to hear and then it kicks late yep and so like and again personal to the player what they actually sense like if we put a a a you know a sense like we put hack motion y on on your hands we we would see that happen right at probably a higher rate through the hit but you'll sense it at different times based on each individual player which would be really cool for players to kind of mess with which is great okay so now we'll uh we'll go to havin Spectrum okay which we we talk a lot about havin okay for a lot of different reasons blah blah blah okay so let's go to five again all right and here here we go again with what's actually going to happen we're going to shove the Pivot Point back in here so this lead hip is going to go towards the screen and then away from the target and this lead arm this elbow try to take and just move it towards my hand there's the ab hit this is abduction this lead humorous came off of T TJ's PEC and moved in this space so he's not looking to lower the golf club down to find the bottom out there because if he's if he's up here and he pivots here right now I'm going to go this way to control the bottom out okay and control the release if I'm up here and then this is the Pivot Point I'm moving I'm I'm in essence I'm moving my Center amass my pelvis forward so I can lower this to control the bottom out okay two different releases there lead hit pivot is going to be an arm lowering action and Trail hit pivot is going to be a level hit action yes exactly exactly so let's start with that and then we'll get into the passive release which is in the hands okay so go to five again for us and we'll do a p well actually yeah you can hit this one okay just go to five now we're going Trail hip pivot and Lead arm goes across there you go good yeah way more stable too yeah yeah yeah yeah interesting right so and when definition of stable right there you go the face was was rotating less yes so both are stable yeah exactly that TJ's just inferring to the rate of rotation in the club face he'll feel it like feel it like almost never rotate you know like meaning that the face isn't tumbling this way totally yep okay um hit us another one like that but one one constant motion okay into to five Trail hit pivot and Lead arm across level hit different and like when you're watching this just to the naked eye you'll see the differences m in both of those different patterns and again the thing is like notice we don't either is great like again we got tiger he was kind of good okay yeah and obviously like there's more to to like his greatness I mean great putter great mind great short game right but we would also put tiger in a great ball striking C category because stats talk about it unequally yeah he was number one in uh I think Strokes gained approach or irons one of those categories for a number of years something that wasn't matched until um Scotty Sheffer of this past year who also has some of that going on absolutely but then throughout the course of history we got Lee trino we got Y and we got havin who I mean that guy hits it unbelievably well Meo and like all these guys like anybody that plays on tour neeman's on a heater neeman's on a heater I mean shoot shooting 59s and 60s is pretty darn good all right right so like you see these different release patterns so like who in the heck is to say that one is better than another M like again it's a bar conversation you're sitting there arguing with your buddy over preferences at this point yep okay okay so who I think it' be good to just explain like what type of a player yeah each one of these like you can f fill these buckets with different types of players so um players that are searching for distance okay okay would be lead hip pivot and arm lower guys interesting if you watch every single long drive athlete they are all that type of a player they extend earlier the club face the radar rotation is nuts and they they have the ability to get into these crazy swing speeds because of that right like like if I'm going to um really lower the arms right I can also meet that with a vertical force and exactly there's a lot of power in that exactly and talking with K RS who's our strength and conditioning coordinator for for our Academy the first thing he does with our Junior players is just teaches them how to jump yep so that's vertical Force how to lower how to go up which is funny because we think a golf is being just rotation turn more kind of ideas right well yeah you're going to turn and you don't need a heck of a lot of it like really most player it's very easy to turn 90° like the shoulder axis 90° but a spiral right has like rotation but it also travels upward it's in a vertical Direction in a vertical Direction exactly exactly so it those types of players could be potentially Junior athletes because what we're what we're talking about is like if we want to stabilize well if we want to lower the rate of rotation the club face then what we can do is just shove the Pivot Point back a little bit that's completely fine we can do that you know and and we can shove it to a lot of different points in space like the the the place that's no good is this lateral pelvic sway like if I'm here into five and then I just shove my pelvis towards the target this doesn't look good all of a sudden no doesn't at the same time if I'm in 5 okay and I shove my pelvis this way all of a sudden this doesn't look okay okay you can overcook either way yeah so we need some amount of of rotation in the pelvis and that really this is a different conversation but that's really because of the upper spiral line what we see the ribs doing to influence that but you'll feel okay I can have this release I can have that release those are both rotary the pelvis is is Rotary there it's not going side to side yes exactly see exactly okay okay so um more distance more power you're looking for probably more of a lead hip release yep where you can um generate a little bit more vertical force and let the face flash because that also increases CL speed a little bit as well exactly exactly if you're also a player that needs like every bit of distance that you can possibly muster so we're going to have a ball that needs to launch a little bit higher for you okay and the tendency is going to be that it's going to Tumble on itself this way which typically lowers the amount of spin for players so you're going to have a higher launch lower spin ball that ball that's a cannonball that's nukes yep that's nukes that's kind ofum because we got the face rotating and we're going vertical so I can unlo this earlier in the hands fair so now there's the shaft M so I get this higher launch so there's our Dynamic Loft okay okay players on the other end of spectrum who may be um kind of bomb it hit it hit it a decent ways but can't keep the ball in the golf course there you go yep I need more Precision so I want to lower the rate of rotation um typically like those types of players like if we're playing golf let's say we're hitting an approach shot if I have a higher ball speed the last thing that I really wanted to do is like I I don't want to lose control of it left because that that typically means long so I don't want to chip or putt downhill right and if I'm long and left now if I'm a if I'm a right-handed player long left with that excessive draw and I've got a downhill left to right chip downhill left or right putt it's out of control this way sure not saying that you can't draw it with a low rate of rot Club face M but it's going to limit how much it tumbles so if you miss it's a little bit short and it's a little bit right okay that's an uphill right to left putt uphill right to left chip interesting right so just the playability of it from a release perspective is is that so these these folks that don't have much Club speed if it's really tumbling and the ball is like this higher draw you're still never going to lose control of it like crazy long left cuz the ball's not in the air long enough to do it right okay so juniors typically typically lower weight athletes as well will see this okay and that that typically is like a shorter player as well um Rory um players on the LPGA Tour compared to the PGA Tour yeah you'll see way more lead hit pivots on the LPG and and Junior athletes okay so it just depends on what your preferences and I get some of you are playing and and looking at this more from an aesthetic purpose you want to look a certain way I get that like we all have that I mean I look at my damn golf swing and I go man I'm still freaking like doing BS where I don't want to do BS so it's this I think is an important talk because we we just need the right diagnosis that's healthy yeah okay and again you shove yourself out into these unhealthy patterns typically unhealthy patterns is we'll see lateral pelvic movement as the main unhealthy pattern because that leads to like excessive extent and sometimes some excessive side Bend because of that like in spots that we don't want to see it side Bend rotation laterals in the appropriate spots are still okay but it's just to a certain degree so like that's a different conversation in its own right but we're talking just little differences in pivot Points that then leak into differences in the direction of the arms that then Rel it leads into release and how the forms and what we see the golf club doing and where it flashes cool okay kind of a deep dive there's probably going to be some some questions on this just your own personal preferences um which you know I think each one of us have our own preferences for our own game and what we're looking to to create but as well as you know the students that we're fortunate enough to coach um but those preferences come from an individual player by player perspective right it's not shove everybody in One freaking pot because that has never worked and it's not going to work for you history yeah yeah um and if I just can add one thing in here I mean like in these videos we are doing our absolute best to give you like this is a lot of information yeah um as much information as you can possibly have to sort of make an informed decision on what your release should be right but I think there's still going to be a lot of people that watch this and go I still don't know like I'm still guessing like they're going to they're going to go to the range and they're going to try Trail hip and they're going to try lead hip and they may just yeah have struggle with that right so exactly come see us come see us like we do virtual stuff um TJ has a wonderful program coming up a a new one coming up that's um uh the swing Improvement series and then on top of that both Alex's and Arizona are are developing a scoring Improvement series now that most of us are heading into the summer months for for us American players or Northern Hemisphere hemisphere players um so we're here to help again it's like we're especially on our YouTube like TJ just said a lot of this is just education and from that information then you can start to better diagnose your own game but we get it I mean it's a hard Fring game and the golf swing can be extremely complex especially when you're trying to like understand it at a higher level MH and then you know as you understand it better and you understand your own game it becomes simple again so for it to become simple again you need the right diagnosis that's what we're trying to do on this channel and what we do on a daily basis with again the students that we're fortunate enough to coach so thanks so much for us we love you to death keep us posted on your own games ask any questions that you have we'll see you next time\n",
      "okay Max today we're talking about takeaway the importance and how to set up your swing to hit some flushers let's do it let's do it so today we're talking about takeaway there's a lot to go into this small fraction of the Swing if you will but I mean the takeaway is important because it's going to set you up for the rest of the Swing so I think first I'd love to hear your thoughts on the importance of the takeaway and then we'll dive into everything that goes into it yeah I think you kind of hit the nail on the head um the way that I kind of view takeaway is more or less just like if we can kind of nail the takeaway the rest of the golf swing just kind of is able to happen yeah and we don't really have to try to do anything you know kind of funky in transition or in the in the downswing so right yeah and real quick if you set up uh to the camera face on yep I think to help people understand at least what we would view as takeaway if you know the PE system it's going to be about P2 two and a half so that's when shaft is at parallel and maybe just a fraction pass anywhere in here is going to be what we'd consider the takeway and again like Max said that's setting up the swing because from there it's just that Snowball Effect yep so talking about takeaway what does the body do I would say to start the swing right we talk about the upper spiral or you can think of the upper body is what's going to initiate that takeaway one thing I'll see a lot with people is if you were to set up down the line here one fault I'll see a lot of golfers do is you hear I got to get open I got to get deep so you see the trail pelvis pull back and what's that going to do it's going to suck the club inside hands go immediately inside yeah then what's the rebound as you work through in the down s kind of gets a little deep and then what we'll see is like then it gets a little steep over the top once we get that swipe Miss you'll tend to see a lot of that kind of tilt picture where the club face is open right or sometimes we'll flip it when we tilt all kind of comes from that like takeway that's a little bit too far inside yeah so you hear what I got to get the body open that would be what we'd consider a wrong way to go about that so something we prefer to see is that upper spiral on that trail side starting to pull you up back and away and for us that's feeling like the chest you hear us talk about the chest takes it away or the upper body takes it away yep and I think a big thing too when we do this is feeling like we almost have a stretch from like so my left hip pocket almost to like my right kind of shoulder there's going to be quite a stretch across my uh like across my core here yeah so lead hip Trail shoulder and you're just trying to pull on that rubber band or pull on that create some tension go ahead and show me that a couple times of yeah down the line so it's going to be here where chest moves it and then I stretch and let my hips go so if I do this face on you can kind of see yeah and honestly a good drill for doing this is putting the club across your chest and going stretch there so you can see that kind of spiral start to work and then as I keep mov moving now the hips are now engaged but they're not sucked way behind me yeah I'm just creating a little bit more stretch that way I can let that spiral go on the through swing do that again from face on where you you do that first half what we'd consider the takeway right about P2 so stretch that band and look how quiet that trail pelvis is in relation to the chest right you can tell the chest or the spirals doing the majority of the pulling as you keep working up we're now going to see okay there's a little more pelvis engagement to get open but you didn't start with the pelvis we started with the chest or the upper spot yeah and I think mean kind of making sure that the that the pelvis responds to what the upper body is doing is super super key to feeling that I love that so you know in our opinion or our preference is the upper spiral or the chest is what's going to initiate that's what we would consider that's what the body does yes so now talking about well what do the arms do and even what do the hands do to play their part as it relates to takeaway and I think specifically for people at home the center of mass right so just quick education on that again it's generally where the club's going to balance so wherever this Center of mass is in space is going to dictate where's that club going and how it affects the rest of the golf exactly so I think first and foremost with the hands we get the hands to actually kind of control where the center of mass is and you know at the same time we get Club face stability as well yeah you need both of those work so if I make this picture here we're down the line and I like roll my hands over which we see quite a bit too yes that club face is wide open now and then we'll look at the center of masses it's behind behind me and even under in relation to your hand so somehow you got to get that club which is where you'll see the arm start to fire up when look at it does to your wrist now you got this extremely cuffed wrist extremely open at the top we got to compensate somewhere else now yep and it usually comes from like that picture there get a little bit steep over the top so the arms will fire down and then again the body is responding to the arms not the arms responding to what the body's doing correct let's see um even a common one you see is you know like these days Dustin Johnson or more call you want the club face shut you want a bod wrist often times there will be Overkill and that club face is extremely shut and now we got to find a way to compensate correct exactly so for the arms the arms are there to support the club but it's going to be the wrists again we're talking takeaway y it's going to be the wrists that are starting to pitch that Center a mass or pitch that club in the fashion we want so go ahead and set up no golf ball yet but if we were going to make a sequence out of this number one would be upper spiral to start the takeaway number two you just did it right there that's perfect the wrists or the hands start to kick the center Mass up and somewhere from this P2 working our way into P3 P4 the arms start to then go up and now you have that nice takeaway that leaks into a really good back swing yep so the sequence would be upper spiral wrists arm supporting as we work it up to the top yep I love that so just some quick hand education what we're trying to do with this club there's a couple ways we can move the center of mass and the club itself so number one is radial deviation so you can think of that as thumbs up or if you had the club head you're trying to get the club head above your hands it's just in the wrist kicking that club head up now like Max is starting to demonstrate what do we do when the club head gets below my hands that's considered older deviation or you can think thumbs down and again that kicks the club head below my hands yep the next one we have is wrist flexion and wrist extension so wrist extension if it's your Trail arm you can think Palm towards the camera or you can think how do we move the club head to the right and you can see there the club face stays relatively passive that's how we keep the club face Square now if we release the club or throw the club that is Trail wrist flexion and it'd be the opposite right for your lead so this would be flexion on the lead hand this would be extension on the way through and the last one Max touched on this a little bit is rolling the face inside that is what we call suating of the trail alarm and pronating of the lead you can see there's that CED wrist again that we don't like to see that wide open Club face if you have any bit of rolling the face or rolling those forearms you see a lot of face flashing through the strike to try and square be a result of like pronating that trail wrist through the strik you're can see that that trail forearm get over the lead forearm yes so now we're going to talk about what we'd like to see preference wise first and then some cures for every everything else we see going on so if you were going to hit a golf ball here and we'll even Tee It Up I think when we're talking about drills and talking about fields I prefer something off of te so it's viewed as a workstation rather than oh I'm trying to hit golf balls flush I'd absolutely agree so I think biggest thing that that we kind of view as a preference would Club head just slightly outside the hands if not on the hands yes we tend to see this quite a bit this is probably something we don't prefer quite as much want to stay away from that yeah I mean there are good players that can do this from here but I think we found more success if we can kind of live in this Zone here that club head is just either on the hands or just outside the hands it allows the club to work a little bit more efficiently through the golf ball and the other thing I think to point out too go back to that same spot yeah we want that right Club head slightly in front or even online with this Leading Edge matching your spine angle y all right Trev so show me this kind of drill that that we can do to help kind of get into that Preferred Risk condition for the takeaway 100% so just set up to the golf ball and to keep it simple goal number one get the club head above your hands without turning or lifting those arms okay so that means we got to go into some radial deviation good see that club head is in line or above his hands now without turning or anything going on we got to move the club head over to his Trail side so now we're talking about some radial deviation we're talking about some trail wrist extension and now he's in that takeaway spot so just rehearsing that a couple times to go that's the place I want to end up in so above the hands to the right that's what we're trying to feel and now he can make yeah that little loopy almost like a little half circle yes beautiful and then when he's ready to go he can start to work on upper spiral that sequence we talked about if he can take it away to that spot so go ahead and show us one awesome and again that just put you in a really good spot of if I can get to this takeaway position if you will that's going to set me up for success and we're going to stay away from position because it's a dynamic spot you're only moving through here in a split second but if you start to really nail okay if I look at myself on camera and I'm moving through that spot I know I'm setting myself up for Success yep well I noticed even just doing a drill simple as that it's really really easy to get the middle of the club face to the back of the golf ball yeah you set those wrist structure your conditions are good to go now just let the body do its thing and you're set yourself up yeah the body just kind of responds to where the wrists are at 100% what's this contraption you got in my uh my hand here yeah so this one's great too just another way to incorporate good risk conditions good takeaway and turn it into a swing a little more Dynamic than the last one so that alignment six on the outside of your grip it's on his lead side when he sets up to the golf ball big key here is you can see how much of a forward press that puts him in we're going to try and fight that a little bit and be as close to a standard setup as possible then from here he's going to see through radial deviation or Club head above his hands how long can he slide that alignment stick down his leg and you can see how severe that Center of mass starts to work up yeah that gets like vertical super super fast yeah and if we start to go incorrectly you're going to see how quickly this stick comes off and what I like about this is it gives you immediate feedback am I doing this right or not rather than let's hit a golf ball check the camera and it may be a wasted rep yep all right TR so as I'm starting to work this this stick down my lead leg here yeah at what point should I start to turn my body I what point is like do I have enough Rd or radial deviation to get this club to start to turn behind me so if I was going to give you like a a definite spot I would say by the time that stick is starting to graze down your lead knee okay is a good time to start that sequence of upper spiral as we start to work so if you want to just rehearse a couple takeaways yep slide it down start to queue up the takeaway and you start to find your flow y so if we were going to do this in pieces to start just so the folks know what we're looking for slide it down to your knee that'll be Piece One Piece two is the upper spiral pulls it away and then piece three we're going to rotate chip it through okay and again you can do this in pieces and then you can start to blend it so I'll let you dictate you want to piece it or blend it yeah I'll piece it first here okay boom excellent okay Max what do you got as far as drills to help with takeaway yep so this is going to be more body oriented um takeaway things that we're going to do for drills um first one that I like it's super super simple especially because I think we all have golf balls and we can do this on the driving range yeah so kind of helps you know get that takeaway a little bit more neutral a little bit more straight back you know which will in turn if we feel straight back with the body the club head will tend to want to stay right on our hands maybe just outside our hands just following along exactly so what I do is I'm going to have you set that club up right behind the golf ball okay and then I will put another golf ball here behind the Club head yeah and your goal as a player is to push this club back or sorry push the golf ball back MH which will then you can already tell do that again for me yeah when we do that you push that ball back that ball is going to generally roll back towards the camera on a straight line and when you do this you have this picture of Club head outside the hands and you've done it all because you've moved your body you haven't really moved your hips or anything you haven't really even set your hands yet yes but you've just moved your body straight back yes which keeps the club you know Square to the Target right now as well yes what I what I felt there was you know how long can I keep the back of this club head on this ball and it wasn't in the sense of I have to move off this golf ball and reach to do it it's just how much can I turn and challenge that upper spiral to push Yep this ball away like it's going to come off at some point but like you said I've done this a couple times now and that club head is outside my hands and the cool part is I haven't even added any radial just kicking this club head up which is when the arms can do their part so it's a perfect way to nail the first two or three feet of this takeaway yep and I think the cool thing about this too is you can start to identify um you know what you do in the takeaway so if you're somebody that takes the the golf the golf club a little bit too far inside like that you're going to see the golf ball going towards your body well look at these look at this you're caught in the act and look at the picture yeah exactly look at the picture that you get there probably going to see something like that correct now if you're somebody that takes it too far away boom you're going to see this now the arms are super disconnected yeah I got some fle because you're kind of forcing the club head outside your hands and this is something we'd consider probably a little bit too far outside your hands maybe a little bit quote I got route you got to make a huge kind of shape in the transition in the back swing to to get the club to where we needed to go well and what I noticed right there too is I mean the the ball wasn't even on the club head that long so you can tell it's more up than it is turn with the body it's a lot of arm and shoulder flexion than it is upper spir rotation when I when I do this drill kind of feeling like that club head is a brush and I'm trying to brush that grass as long as I can transition I'm I'm going to allow my body which is turning away from the Target or away from this first golf ball right to get the club up at some point right right some point you're going to turn far enough the club head's going to get up it's got to go up y push away get that golf ball to roll as straight back as you can and then turn and hit it all right push away what you'll notice too is when you do that it almost feels like transition and that kind of forward swing can just happen right it's like I set all the energy here yes and you can kind of play with that too if I want to throw the golf ball a little further what happens to transition yes just super easy yes what I liked about that was transition was an afterthought and then I mean we talk about floating like I felt like the club was just floating because I put all the focus in pushing the ball out yep rather than picking the club up exactly I think that's a great drill yep he's got the head cover out what are we doing now all right TR I'm going to put this right in your lead armpit it's going to be right through here ex excellent okay just bear with me yeah now what so what this drill is good for is if you're somebody like myself who we have this tendency of we kind of get the arms a little bit disconnected boom head cover falls straight on the ground right yeah a lot of shoulder flexion going exactly so we kind of make falsify this turn in the back swing by like letting the arms kind of go up and out yeah almost like a fake turn right turn and I'm very very guilty of doing this so what I do in order to avoid doing that is I throw that head cover right in my lead armpit yep and I keep it in there as long as I can I'm pretty much only make like a nine to three swing when I do this yeah you can't really make a big turn with this no cuz at some point you're going to turn and then the arms are going to have to go up so you start to lose the but this is really kind of training that that good takeaway again we're not talking more than about the first three four feet of this go swing you know the club head's not moving very far but just feeling as if you're GNA keep that head cover pinched in between your left Peck and your uh your left arm there well look what it's doing to the center M it's keeping out in front of me again and again if you want to play with like for me like I personally add some Rd that's okay because the arms responding yes and I I would imagine if I start to subate the trail pronate the lead if I go this way that's another way it's going to leak out so you're like well I don't lift so this doesn't apply to me but if you actually roll it open yep you still get this Gap that occurs here so this is another way for instant feedback of well if I do this and lift I I shouldn't I shouldn't even hit the ball because I failed well that's that's what I like too is like I I'm feeling this pinch in here as long as I can and and then I'm not letting it drop until even if after I hit the golf ball obviously it's going to drop at some point after I hit the golf ball I make a big enough turn right but I try to keep it in there as long as I can to kind of feel that again just really feeling like I stay making the the back swing with only my my core is where I feel it yeah just letting my my hips and my arms kind of respond to what my core is doing okay so we're gonna this is going to be very pitchy yes all of you know this much of a swing back that much weight through it really it really challenges you to use the the upper body and that upper spiral as the driver rather than something else let's see how we do here if I get busted or not I tell you what I was fighting for my life I could feel my arms wanting to lift but I think we did a good job I think that was pretty solid okay to quickly recap just talking about takeaway the importance of it how it sets up your swing what the body does what the arms do even what the hands do a little bit and some great drills for you guys to do to clean up your takeaway thanks for

      "what's up guys te how are you good man today we get to talk about the 3D look of the golf swing ready to dive let's go let's go this is kind of a fun one um and I think it goes along with like how we really like to coach te which is this like very holistic view to to the golf swing for for players just a better like understand it like what the golf swing is um you know and then everybody has like these little different quirks like you see it all over the tour right like Sheffer and havin don't look anything like no they don't they look very different uh but again both really high level players so I I think for us like in in coaching it's it's always this quest to like understand what the like absolute laws are like everybody abides by these principles right like that's fun and when we really think about it there not a whole lot of those things those items MH I would agree with that fleeting like there's there's just a few and so I think when we're talking today about this like three-dimensional like view or picture of what the golf swing is what your golf swing is and how to improve it I think the best place to start with this is just understanding like where the center of mass of the ribs are and how they marry or communicate with the Center mass of the club so let's first Define those two things where's the center of mass of the club uh Center and mass of the club would be the balance point right where you could just hold that thing and it would just roughly level out exactly Center of mass yep and then Center of mass of the ribs we could roughly say it like around the level of the heart right right in this area just inside the heart okay yep yep got it exactly so there's are two points that we're going to start with okay I like it we're going to film this from like multiple different angles too because human beings just in general we just stink at three-dimensional yes Maps like seeing it we see things in two Dimensions really easily so when you're looking here from this like down the line view we can see it in in a two-dimensional space but then we also need to take a look at it from either like posterior view or or caddy view face on so that we can at least better see this just generally like how this thing is is moving in this three dimensions right so if you were to just set up for us sure you've created this space when you set up like the distance between the center mass of your ribs and the center mass of the club there is some amount of space there right yes okay so when we're moving okay and we'll see this in almost every single highle player that the center of mass of the ribs throughout the entirety of the Swing is trying to move away from the center mass of the of the golf club mhm so when we go into swing start really what we're going to do is almost keep this where it's at in space and we'll just do this like and then we'll come back to like kind of different aspects of the Swing different parts of the Swing but if you were to just move that through the spiral line away from the center mass of the golf club and keep going keep going keep going and eventually the golf club's going to go ahead and get towed there you go that's swing start now eventually where is this going to travel kind of on the same direction direction that my ribs just told it to right exactly so as this is working up on its plane you'll just keep on turning as it's going up here now where do you need to go it needs to go away from where the center of mass of the golf club is going so here's the whole idea of this we'll do this all the way into the Finish is that the center of mass of the ribs is trying to get away from the center of mass of the golf club at all times H so at the start it's trying to move away as the golf club starts to work its way on its Arc up back and away this starts to move forward in this space so if the golf club's moving in that direction you're moving or your Center Mass your ribs is moving in this space and then if we take that one step further right like through the strike yep where's the center mass of the club going to go it's going to go right on that same direction of the ribs so down this way down and across yep and then as the center mass of this shoots out yep we'd see a lot of people kind of go with it right uh-huh that's a blocking pattern block uh-huh so you'd kind of want to feel that the ribs can start to move away from where that yes mass is shooting exactly exactly and we'll see this in a lot of different ways like we see it in like a player's head I mean if you want to talk c-spine stuff you can talk c-spine stuff you can talk Center mass of the ribs there's a lot of different ways to see this but like in our terminology like how we see most items right is there's a rib system which is from the bottom of the rib cage so the top of your Dome top of your cap okay and then there's a pelvic system which is from the bottom of the ribs to the tops of the knees so this would be the pelvic system this would be the rib system rib system okay all right so if we let's just dissect the golf swing into three parts okay we'll have um wait gosh you can articulate this in so many different ways we go load one load two and then unload so three different different points to the golf swing you could go swing start uh a away swing finish and through the strike there's a a bunch of different ways to look at this but in essence there's three different parts to this this how we're going to describe this so let's let's go part one first okay let's go part one all right very simple So This is Swing start or load one or or or or or or whatever you want to call it's just words you just use whatever words you want exactly you can use whatever words you want but this a swing start here so again we're trying to move this away from this so this is the angle that it's on right now and what's nice is this angle meaning from the center mass of the ribs of the ribs to the center mass of the club is on this angle well guess what else is on that angle this portion of the Spiral line when you say this portion of the Spiral line what do you mean by that so the spiral is going from your lead hip complex across your abdomen underneath uh the armpit and so this portion of the Spiral as it goes up over the top of the scap is on this point l meaning that direction so it matches with this direction got it so this is where you're going to feel swing start is the expansion of this working away so goad and start again yeah so it's there there you go see how we're trying to move this away on that plane and it's getting away from this it's very subtle but see how this space there you go this Space Center mass of the ribs is moving away from the center mass of the club in its Inception of the golf swing there you go now really if you just kept starting to turn that up up up right there this is load one this is the first portion of the golf swing so as soon as this see how it's traveling and it's working in the direction of where the ribs just went this is where now the ribs as this keeps working on its plane you can keep turning and doing all that stuff but this needs to start to drop and what's the main dropper pelvis pelvis is the main dropper as this is working up on that that plane and you can continue to turn so start dropping now there so see where this went te the center of mass of the ribs went in this space because the center Mass Club is moving in that space okay so would you say that that's somewhat to keep this distance between this and this somewhat constant is that the idea or or not the idea relatively yes okay yes because like how are you going to make that space that much longer from the from the address position like it's at its furthest uhhuh space just an address right but what you're trying to do is actively move this away from that is it going to get dramatically like larger that space absolutely not right but now as the golf club planes and works to to the top or P4 that's where the player's dropping good now where would you go with the club on it shoot here this would support that by working in the in the opposing Direction there you go so what's nice is the spiral line is in charge mainly absolutely for uh for like load one or the first first portion of this obviously it keeps it keeps going because we're going to continue to turn but man that's when the drop starts right so the big deal here is if I'm up and away and the golf club works up here so I stay in this space that's a problem yep yep so that like where the drop occurs for high Lev players is somewhere between P2 and P3 that's the start and then all the way to P4 they'll be fully dropped in there you go that's what you see at a Rory right like see how TJ's lead leg goes in like this lead knee goes into into more flexion because of that drop State yeah that's it okay okay so let's hit one with just this idea like in and the whole idea of this from a Down the Line perspective is kind of this Arc that the club's going to be on and as the club's arcing on its plane both in the away and the forward TJ is just going to manage where his Center of mass of the ribs is in space compared to the center of mass of the golf club okay so it's a way to start trop boom and Away there we go very cool so in essence it's like the the center of mass of the ribs does not like the center of mass of the club and it's always trying to get away from it okay got it let's do that again got it one more time yep same idea same idea good okay the the other nice thing with this is that they both are active here like I'm you're you can actively motor the club in space like you can send it on this Arc right I can actively move it I'm also actively moving this so it's not like I'm just dragging on this thing like then you lose perception of where the club is got it so if I'm going here and the golf club now I'm going to send it on its plane that's just where I'm going to turn and drop with this so I'm going here now I can actively shoot this on its plane down out and away while I'm actively moving this away got it so run here there here there okay it's that understanding all right okay let's hit one more with this this like idea of like actively sending the center of mass of the golf club on its on its path during the entirety of your swing but just managing where the center of mass of the rib that's such a good look beautiful look very cool now if you thin it right like that was that was no good we just need to drop the pelvis just a little bit more to support that spiral didn't allow a lot of time there to drop the pelvis for sure yep so it's just kind of the balance of all these forces right exactly Beau beautiful and just the sensation of that that's got to feel so nice just in general so yeah you're just balancing out where this wants to move in space and how this supports it right that's the main deal right so again from like this down the line P perspective like the the plane would be somewhere in here and you can modify it based on height your own like perception of the golf swing if you want the golf club a little bit flatter you can do that you want the golf club more upright for any reason then you can do that but you're just always to balance out this Center of mass with the center of mass of the club there we go yes yes it so let's do this as well from face on so we can go ahead and see it from this perspective as well this perspective now and this is where it's it's difficult cuz in essence what we're going to ask you to do is like share your perception of the golf swing from both down the line and face on to create this 3D perspective so if you're set up from this perspective here this face on or caddy view the center mass of the ribs and the center mass of the club are roughly stacked on top of one another it might change with driver and different clubs but just in general we're here okay so this doesn't like that so it needs to move away on its curve and and again the way to see this I think is is either M here is Mia here is CH line if you set up again so would either be here but that also is like representative of the Spiral line there is a lateral and a vertical component to the spiral line like it works on this diagonal from this hip complex across the abdomen underneath TJ's armpit to work in here so we're in this space got it so in essence you're trying to move your Center mass of your ribs on that plane good and once you go there and the golf club starts to climb up that because the continued rotation what's this going to do there you go and so you'll see if you do that again so just go to load one for me okay and the golf club will be right in here teach good this in DJ's mind he's going to send it on that in this direction just up back and away and as it's working there where's this going there you go there's load to now where do you want to send this it's on this plane down out in the way so where's the center of mass of the ribs going to go there you go excellent so let's hit one at kind of like a cruisy pace here homes where we can really distinctly see like load one load two and then the unload so cool so cool that counter force is beautifully beautifully working so it goes back to like what we were really talking about at the start of this which is like what items in the freaking golf swing would we classify as like law to kind of classify this as law that this Center mass of the ribs sort of acts as a counterbalance to where the mass is swinging right exactly so at the end of the day like good players are really good at swinging this yeah in space right like where where is this being swung like it's it's up here it kind of moves you can shallow it you can do all kinds of different stuff with it you can do whatever you want got it but good players are very good at controlling the instrument okay the body is simply there to support that and so when there's this counter Force to the directionality of this swinging oo it feels nice good yeah play with this too right like if somebody doesn't have enough lateral movement here and they just like to send the golf club away and fall into the space immediately okay if if somebody drops in the immediate to send the club up oh I can have a little bit more vertical directionality of of the center mass of the ribs so you can just play with it based on your own Tendencies as a golfer which is really fun yeah being able to play with forces oh baby now you start to feel nice uh yeah that's a lot more fun than you know position a position B that sort of idea right well and and you know like the the the P system is great for just describing a general space that you know either your body is or the the club is in space like that's good but if you're just like hunkered into like here's P1 and then P2 should look like this and three is here blah blah blah blah blah then like o boy clunky right this is fun cuz it's Dynamic like you're moving all you're always just a aware of where the center of mass is in space compared to where the center of mass of the club is in space got it fun got it very cool okay so let's send one more okay the last intention here is you can be active with how much energy you want to put into this you can actively send that okay but just know that the where the where the ribs need to be moving in space to support that act so I'm going to bust this one a little bit so you can it's it's up to you it's the energy amount that you determine as the athlete that you need to put into the instrument got it that's so cool and again like here's the fun thing with like we rely on eye test a ton the eye test there you'll watch that and go shoot doesn't look like TJ's like working hard but there's tons of speed in the instrument mhm which is great like you even hear him before you want me to bust this one yeah you can if you want to if you want to you got you got the tools to do whatever you want with it right but the interpretation of bust it like we have one one uh one young man in the academy that always thinks that busting it is moving this through through impact laterally to bust it this way MH which it looks like he works really hard and doesn't get that much out of it so what do we always work with him on how to counter that force with where he wants to shoot the golf club yeah that's busting it right exactly which is the whole point of this conversation and understanding the 3D look of the golf swing as it moves in space compared to the ribs and the center mass of the Club you do those two things you going to be looking right baby you H some better shots looking right and feeling right that's right okay flush him\n",
      "all right here we go today we're talking side Bend we're going to help you understand it at a much higher level let's dive let's go hi what's up dude this this one gets misconstrued extremely extremely yes now S1 okay so TJ sacrum and see1 are just stacked up would you say you're in any amount of like substantial side Bend right now not very substantial no I mean very minimal there might be just a hair of it just because my right hand sits lower than my left yeah but so we might see like a yeah like a little baby but it's it's I'm not sitting here going like this yeah for sure yeah yeah exactly so right now we would say TJ is in Fairly fairly neutral spined when it comes to lateral Bend you might have some amount of flexion State blah blah BL but that's a that's a different look when we're talking lateral Bend or side Bend we're always talking in this lateral perspective this way this but if I just load this way like this distance increases both in a vertical and in a lateral Direction because of the shape of the Spiral it's this okay now it made TJ's chest rotate and we'll see in here the C and t-spine will start to bend slightly in here but down in here nothing nothing so very very stable in the lumbar exactly we would Define as Poor Side Bend would be this action here okay and what that is is all we're doing in the golf swing is we would shoot the pelvis lateral as it rotates and now from here to rescue the club to slot it I'm going to I'm going to side Bend substantially in the elpine okay and the the health the health problems with that are like the the elpine is designed and way to go into flexion and extension States if we throw extension uh flexion and extension State along with lateral Bend that's where it gets hairy real quick so it's too much substantial pelvic lateral movement that then def like now we're going to get into the pivot of the spine in the L spine to work in the lateral Bend to rescue the club and Slot it which again to show that I would look like this goes uh lateral and it rotates see how the golf Club wants to go out here so I've got to rescue the golf club this way so now we can see where the L spine is bending to rescue the club to slot it here okay so if I just drop to some degree in this like transitional phase and then I start to Upper spiral drive right now I look in here now people think that looks like a ton of side Bend and it's not it's just I have way more flexion state in this Trail hip compared to where I was before see it's gone here and now I've rescued yes so the point being maintained hip flexion does not correlate to side Bend or more of it actually it it actually correlates to less side Bend healthier pattern and definitely like what we want is ideally zero side Bend for health reasons in the elpine which is the point of this video because most people look at side Bend like they correlate too much side Bend to health problems and they're both right and they could be wrong it's just where that side bin happens and then again thresholds throughout the entirety of the spine the point is is just in the c-spine and the t-spine you can have way more of that threshold and still be okay like think of like a tree like the top of the tree can do this stuff all the time but you do too much of that down here and you break your freaking tree over okay similar to how the spine is is made up not exactly but good way to look at it got it okay so let's hit a shot here te where I'd and this will look like substantially like more than what you'll see out of everybody on tour but this will be just this like Drop now stay dropped and that same idea of back chain through the strike where you just maintain the hip flexion like you'll be like old man mode like this way through the H and just chippy one out there 50 to 100 yards got it good let's face the camera again and just hug that shaft again for me please I show back chain in the away okay all the way to like rotated here there we go so this is the back chain State well if you have the upper spiral driven movement here you would look more in there and that that lateral Bend here in the T and C spine is what keeps TJ's head more centered rather than like way off the ball so in essence like what I'm saying is let's keep this like hip this hip flexion here as the upper spiral keeps driving there so this moved slightly very slightly laterally okay let's do the same thing in the forward Direction so if we're maintaining this hip flexion as this now goes into there we go so see that that shape right there see where TJ shape went in the c-spine and t-spine there's this Bend in here and then it's like safe Ville in the L spine because there's hardly any bend down there if any there we go got it yep okay okay let's maybe take a look at this from like face on as well thing if you can just hug okay and then show back chain dominance in the away and then where would that that lateral Bend be if any there we go see where TJ's head goes It goes more back into like that centered look let's do the same picture on the other side there we go now let's see just a combination of both of those like upper spiral movements as well as like the the maintained hip flexion beautiful look look through there okay what would the away swing look like good beautiful okay let's go ahead and hit one kind of at that energy level that you just showed and you're just kind of chippy one out there for us but biggest thing is the maintained hip flexion throughout the entirety of this exercise okay let's do that again maintain that hip flexion even longer throughout the hit you just stay dro this won't necessarily look like a a tour golf swing cuz we're missing like the the energy in the upper spiral to pull you into finish there we go beautiful beautiful that right there is proper side Bend where we don't have this like substantial shoot out of the pelvis and like the L spine starts to get into that substantial side Bend that's where we get into like bad health problems that's the problem with like the look of what people think side Bend really is you can have all that stuff that's fine but it's the appropriate amount high up into the spine maintain your hip flexion it looks like side bin but it's not it's hip flexion not side Bend\n",
      "essentially we're looking at how how fast should my arms be lowering while how fast my torso should be rotating into the golf ball bingo so in everyone's golf swing there is this this proper blend again per player of how much their ribs are rotating relative to how much their arms are lowering now when that gets out of whack you're going to see chunks you're going to see thins you're going to see the whole Gambit of potential misses because there's a mismatch occurring in those areas sure and again this isn't the only thing to pay attention to but if we're going to focus on this concept this is what we are going to pay attention to for this video so what I'm going to have you do is set up to an imaginary golf ball okay face on yeah we'll do face on and walk you through it so you're going to go to the top of your swing and so to just to describe a chunk your ribs essentially are going to stay where they're at and your arms are going to be lowering to the ground so if this were to continue the arms are moving faster down to the ground then his ribs are opening I'm just going to throw that thing into the ground throw straight into the ground that's a that's a common thing we see from a lot of players is like you get up to the top of the back swing and it's like all right their first thought is how do I get the club back to the golf ball and they just lower those arms as quickly as possible while that torso is just hasn't moved an inch correct and first guy I think of is like a Justin Rose his feel is I'm going to keep my back to the Target and I'm going to lower the arms that totally works for him absolutely because just guessing he might be a quick upper body Rotator so he's like I need to slow this down to get this if his if his upper body out races The Arms he's going to start to right throw that club way out and that's going to be the polar opposite if you're someone who has slow arms what is really quick to open up the club feels like it's staying up here in space and now how do I get the club back down to the ground that's where you're to see a late tilt and again more misses are going to come from there so just exploring what rotation rates are what lowering rates are what are some misses that you see so what I look for P5 and your legs being around so if I were to have you swing out towards the driving range P5 is when your lead arm so for us right hand of golfers is the left arm when this arm is parallel to the ground a big key that he has talked to me about worked with me about that I have now sort of passing on to my students is are his legs Square back to the ball just like a dress are they around and if they are it's a pretty healthy blend now some golfers go ahead and show me that P5 position again some golfers their legs are going to be a little open relative while the arms are still down to P5 some guys the legs are going to be more around some guys the arm is going to be maybe P5 and a half there's this range of acceptability right we we always talk about like there's a spectrum to everything there's a spectrum but that's a good place to look for what you don't want to see is someone who has the arms way down this is a great view to see like bring the arms almost P6 and his legs are not around he is on a one-way stop into the Earth before the golf ball all right if I just keep turning here yeah we're late very late so the other one also would be well you don't want to spin out so just going back to this P5 checkpoint let's say the arms get to P5 but his leg Yeah his legs are super round this isn't going to be proper rotation this is going to be more of a oh I was told to fire the hips and now I'm spinning out right cuz from here now like the the lower body is completely outra the upper and so now it's just throw the arms throw the arms to catch up to the golf ball now you got to flip y go up to the top for me again and what we're going to feel is again a slight shift into the lead side as the legs go around and this is going to bring the arms down and now this is more of a feel that's specific to low back that gets him in a good spot he hasn't completely ripped open he's not completely pulling down on the club and this is a appropriate P5 position we'll say yeah from here I feel like I can just you can keep going rotate as much as I want and it's way e e to get that Golf Club back to the Golf to the ground yes and one other marker I like to look at and we're just going to have the golf ball here as a measurement go ahead and show me P5 again and we're going to pay attention to where is the butt end of the club pointed so probably from down the line it's going to be pointing outside golf ball now is it this much maybe not but it's going to be somewhere in this space right and that's good that tells us the club is shallowing without even thinking about any sort of manipulation no actively trading bends this that or the other just that proper blend this club reacts by when you apply force in the transition the club will shallow yeah I think that's a cool thing to look at it's like very subtle but it's very easy to look at it's like where's my butt end my club pointing as I'm starting to get into transition yes and you can see that thing just again it doesn't need to be feet but if it's just slightly on the golf ball or just outside the golf ball you know that the club is working appropriately in transition back to the golf ball let's talk about that for a second so show me P5 but where you feel like the arms are the main driver to get you to P5 so it's going to feel like you're pulling down on it so now taking that butt into the grip it's probably pointing inside ball line so here's what's really cool is now he's inside ball line does it mean he's he can't hit the golf ball from there absolutely not but the club's trying to get to at ball or just outside of it so from here he's going to have to stall the arms this Trail legs generally going to kick out and now you see the late shallow or as we call Early extension yeah cuz if you look at it from face on like I'm just you're hanging back back on that trail side yeah and so to kind of quickly nip early extension in the butt it's a good thing in the sense of you're coming in steep so your body's like I got to find a way to lay this club down I'm going to kick the trail leg out so for as much as people say God I got to get rid of the early extension you actually don't we got to change something else so this doesn't occur correct yeah I always tell people like early extension is a reaction to what you're doing like it's not the sole cause of your issues in the golf swing it actually usually helps you get the club back to the golf ball albe it it's not the most appropriate way or healthy way but your brain and your body go okay hold on I'm in an inappropriate position right now I need to hit the golf ball correct and so the body just again does what it has to do makes it happen yeah so just imagine if I was giving you a lesson I said okay we're going to stop early extending stop humping it but you're still pulling down well now I've moved your low point back because there's no mechanism to save you correct now you're like you're blending like inappropriate swing Now with an appropriate swing and you're kind of like blending the two together so it's like yeah it makes sense why you're hitting three feet behind the golf ball because you're actually actively rotating more appropriately but now you're still you're still pulling on that club correct and what I love about rotation rate and um lowering rates is it applies to every pattern like you you go look at Scotty Sheffer by P5 that club is probably and I don't know for sure but just inside golf ball or just outside he's in a good spot he's in great delivery you look at Neiman he's probably way out here fine spot to deliver the club so this is going to be your goldilock zone of okay just inside golf ball just outside golf ball and we're going to be in a appropriate delivery spot to then deliver the club that's when the arms can go and we got ourselves good compression okay all right trip so we've talked a lot about obviously the arms lowering at a certain rate the chest rotating at a certain rate what are some kind of drills or some some feels that people can do to help them with this yeah so the first one we threw the G shallower on you and what I like about this is there's a line on it we'll talk about that in a second that people can look at for reference so what you're going to do with this guy is make a back swing and that pad is going to be pretty much right up against your right peck so from here if you guys are watching there's this Silver Line right along this pad if he pulls down that line is going to be more perpendicular to the ground so we know he's pulling down we're going to want to be in a situation where this line is more parallel to the ground so now we're in a better spot now is it perfectly going to be parallel no but we want it working in that direction cuz now Club head's laying down appropriate amount of rotation versus the arms lowering he's going to be in a much better spot to hit this ball so the drill is in piece is with piece number one being taking it up to the top okay Piece One Piece two is starting a downswing where this pad feels like it's pushing into his right PE to about P5 and then from there piece number three is going to rock it back a little bit and Chip this ball out there and there you go I honestly love the fact that you caught it a little thin cuz that tells me the arms did not lower probably felt like you were looking at the ball this way yeah I really did like as I was getting into the shot I was very uncomfortable I was like okay yeah very very much in a in a lot of side Bend there on my trail side so we're going to do that one more time I'm not going to walk you through it we'll just have you demonstrate the pieces okay so up P4 P5 much better yeah and so what that really trains us to do is get the body rotating or the ribs rotating and this lead arm starts to work almost back so it's not us keeping the arms up and back but because the ribs start to rotate into it you close this Gap so the arms stay up without you leaving them up that's another big thing we hear well I was told to leave my arms up and rotate maybe not the best description but you see that in players where the club's up here for a second and it has time to change its Dynamic yeah the club starts to passively shallow you always hear that like okay get the club to passively shallow yeah that's going to happen as the upper body and the ribs are starting to work appropriately or we're not actively trying to lower the club so now the club is allowed to fall into that spot yeah you hear all the time like get the club in the slot this in my opinion is what all the teachers before us were talk about this is how you get the club into the into the slot that's how it happens and what's really cool is if you if you grabbed a water bottle is what you start to see with the arms is this Trail arm starts to work down and towards while the lead arm feels like it goes up and back so you get this little shallowing effect or when a force is applied on the club you get it to shallow but the arms relatively speaking stay up but the body has opened up so much more versus that's that's no good cuz now you're way up here and you're tall yep so again kind of I wouldn't say myth busting but clarifying what people mean or meaning when they say leave the arms up Shallow etc etc yeah we're not trying to keep the club up here and just turn we're trying to let the arms in the club passively work but we're not actively putting them into a certain spot yes you get a little bit of more lead arm working internal so you can think elbow points more up towards the sky or the lead Palm points more to the ground and this Trail arm starts to work down in front of you and again you're not sitting here going oh do this cuz now you're going to start to leak into some extension it's just these passive things happen through some good rib rotation so now what I'd like you to do is we're going to do this in TW piece you're going to go up to the top and from P4 you're going to try and feel that squeeze meaning that pad's going to go into your PE and then we're going to hit this ball okay so4 pause start from there feel it push and then straight into the ball yep you're going to go from the top okay so up pause squeeze go yeah yeah and immediately I can feel myself again we're talking about where I'm feeling like I'm at an impact down I'm like way more here again exaggerated for me but I'm way more in the shot for a lot longer than I am when I usually stand up yeah very cool you and I fall in the Campa we go from the top and it's always been I mean we were always taught up one go two and it was always this so our arms were way faster than our body so then we get that extension starts to leak into some low back problems because we're just we're doing it inappropriately Y versus boom now we're in a good spot now the arms have all this free passage down to the ball so now what we're going to do if you don't have a g shallower linan stick we're going to put this underneath your right armpit a portion is going to be underneath there make sure you guys squeeze it tight and it's in there so it'd be under the the trail arm right if we had a left a golfer be under the trail so now what we're going to do is make a back swing up until the point the stick is on his arm which is usually right about lead arm parallel for most people yep we're going be right about P3 so from here if he's an arm poar this guy's coming off immediately and we know we're in trouble and you got immediate feedback so from here we got to do a same movement as when we had the G shallower keep that stick on for as long as possible so we need rotation and we need a little bit more side Bend versus if you have the tendency to arm pull you're going to be in trouble yeah this is this is a drill and exercise I love to give students just because from a kinesthetic standpoint it's so cool to be able to get up obviously the lead arm parallel and just feel what the body has to do correct to maintain that connection correct right you're just like in slow motion I'm just trying to feel where's the where the ribs moving what are the arms doing to maintain that connection it's really cool to just get that feedback immediately yeah and again someone gets this this drill and they're like man like it's really hard to hit golf balls well let's take a step back and not even hit them you can sit in a mirror for hours and just play with that and like you said kinesthetically your body's like well the objective is to do this okay and things just start to happen again a lot of passive reactions occur without trying okay well I heard to do this and this and and then all of a sudden you're like I'm so whacked out man I don't even want to like try anymore correct I know this is when you give a lot of students of your so walk me through how you tell them to do this drill yeah so if I was if I was explaining this or giving this drill to a student I would immediately I always tell them to never start with a golf ball so it's always just if they're on they're on Turf if they're on grass if they're on grass I'll have them put a tea in the ground just to kind of get them used to interacting with the turf appropriately but if it's just on a mat again I'm just going to have them bring the club up to lead arm parallel and and what I have them do is just feel themselves get the club back to their what their impact position would feel like right so trying to get to that impact position while maintaining that connection as long as possible right and once you get there okay recognize where you're at kind of come back out of it and just repeat the process just to again all we're trying to do is ingrain good movement patterns yes right and for somebody who's very arms driven and pulley that goes into a little bit of an early extension pattern their movement's just inappropriate so it's it's trying to re learn the way that the chest is moving the way the arms are moving and so it's just getting used to that feel over and over again and so if we're if we're drilling this or if I was working on this drill myself at home or on the golf course I would probably give myself two to three reps without a golf ball right just really really feel myself get the club back to the golf ball and then I'd give myself two to three reps where I put the golf ball in the way and it's the same feel so the armpit the alignment sticks under my tra arm fit lead arm parallel turn there well notice how short the ball went like that was a beautiful move compared to the first drill right you can put a little speed into it but with that guy we're really trying to ingrain this movement cuz you have that stick laying on your arm you really have to be conscious about the speed you're putting into it cuz for the relative for the average golfer the most of the golfers we see they're a little bit too quick from the top of the back swing and that that quick move is your arms pulling down so it requires you to be a little more conscious of how much energy you're putting into the swing and you got to be really conscious of okay the arms need to work passively into the golf ball if I'm trying to actively move the arms it's never going to work or you're going to find yourself really frustrated with this drill yes so after I do that drill handful of times with the alignment stick I'll throw the alignment stick away and so this is where like you start to progress meets the road the biggest question I always get is like okay we've addressed kind of what the biggest issue is in our golf swing we have given a student a really really good exercise or a drill to feel them get better at that movement or completely change the movement in general here's the drill drill it out it's like all right dude I'm I'm killing this drill I can't translate to a full swing yeah that's like one of the biggest things that we get from students and so I think my the biggest thing that I believe in for for Translating that is start to make the drill feel more like a full swing make it seem more fluid and more natural so obviously that first progression is alignment stick no ball second progression would be alignment stick with the ball and then this third progression is going to be the exact same thing I'm going to take the lead arm up to parallel and then from here I'm just trying to make the same move but I obviously don't have the alignment stick under so it's starting to feel more natural yeah we're Bridging the Gap from drills to reel 100% so I'm trying to feel the same thing lead arm up to parallel that felt pretty similar the reaction of the golf ball told me that that was pretty dang close to what I was doing and what's great too is like for folks at home you take you take a video of maybe doing the drill once or twice with the stick another video without compare side by side and you go okay looks like I got to go back or you know what looks pretty similar let's keep grooving yep so just being in that constant Loop of okay where am I at how well is this transferring do I need to make adjustments or not and then if you really feel like things are progressing with obviously these are very freezer drills like we're stopping at a certain point we're starting again if you feel really comfortable with that okay that last really like test to see how you're progressing is start at a dress get the lead arm up to parallel back to the golf ball all in one fluid swing again how do I translate a drill to a full swing this is the best way to do it so I'm gonna feel the same thing again the golf ball is not going to go more than 50 yards for me I'm trying to make the same speed same rate of same rate of energy in the swing but it's all just one fluid swing well what I love about it too is we're challenging folks to make full range of motion relative to the drill but we got to dial back the speed yes and for guys who are gals who are really quick with the arms it's almost impossible because the arms they're meant to go fast that's where the power is at the bottom to deliver this golf ball or this golf club but to get you into delivery we got again we got to match rotation rates versus the arms lowering y you got to really challenge yourself to be in conscious control of your speed of your swing throughout the entirety of the drill or your practice session because for a lot of people and some of my students it's like really the biggest challenge we have is just controlling the speed yep right and when people are used to yanking down the arms the the conscious level it takes to control that speed is it's tough very tough very tough so what I'm going to have you do the last one I got this from TC when use same thing alignment stick in a club you're going to take the club in your Trail hand just like me if I had an alignment stick I'd be holding it in my left hand resting it on my trail elbow and it should also start to kind of settle in your lead elbow so you're going to be like this looking like me we're both elbows bingo so now we're going to swing it to about lead arm parallel and then when you get there put your left hand on the club ah so it's relatively one you get to see where my arms at if you're too high you might find yourself or if you're too much that way so that's a little bonus you get to see but generally you're going to be here where the alignment stick will hold and you'll play with it to where it's you know 50/50 just balancing on my forearms yes so now we got to start transition how long can the club or his hand stay up here in space but the outside part of the stick starts to tip back so if I were to sit here and help him he's going to do Transition and can it fall back fall back fall back just crank it out as much as you can go go go go yeah and see how much higher his arms are but he's open so if he were to swing this stick is eventually going to fall back behind him but he's going to be falling into the inside so helping him again he's going to Max it out and look how much that club falls behind him are we really wanting him to do that no but if he's been an arm poar he's never had that feeling in his life that's not we're going to Max it out because as soon as I introduce this golf ball this thing's going to Goat that much it's going to move fractionally correct exactly so we go up to the top I'll help you get set here and now he's going to try and leave the arms up forever Crank that stick back and tap this ball right check the tape probably didn't fall too much but it did fall a little bit now we're going to do one incorrectly where he's just going to oh I can do that yeah he's just going to straight yank this club in the ground and what's nice is hopefully you guys can watch this back and see how does the how does the alignment stick react if he pulls down like chunk that's even better yeah it's even better so clear difference right lowering the arms and pulling down versus not so again what I really like about this drill in particular is how much it requires the arms to stay up but we still get the arms playing in space so this is where that I talked about the left arm feels or the lead arm goes up and back but the trail arm goes down and forward it leaks him into some side bend the club reacts by laying down he's free and clear to drop this club on the ball so I that's how I would do that one get it set get it to react hit a ball same thing with your drill take the stick off do the yeah it's just progressing through yeah this one for me at least from from the three we've worked on this is probably the most uncomfortable one so this is probably the drill that I would have to spend the most time on without a golf ball to just feel myself work the club work the arms appropriately obviously check myself on video to make sure things are working appropriately and then introduce the golf ball I think a mistake that a lot of players get into is like they'll try to introduce the golf ball too quickly into a drill especially if it's a brand new movement pattern that they've been introduced to ex it's exciting you're on the Range you want to hit golf balls but in in reality like a lot of the stuff that we do here can be done in a garage in someone's backyard because again we're training lowering rates of the arms versus rotation rates of the chest that's not something that we need the golf ball to give us feedback on no that's the the feedback comes from the video camera that we record ourselves on or the mirror that we practice into obviously introducing the golf ball Pro provides an extra layer of feedback but it's not that direct feedback correct guys thank you so much for watching this video a quick shout out to Tyler C TC he's been a great resource for lck and I Dr a ton of knowledge great guy to learn from y uh thank you guys for watching our video if you liked it drop a like comment subscribe so you don't miss any

until next video guys again we appreciate you guys watching we'll take care\n",
      "all right guys today we're talking all things forward swing where you send the energy here how your body supports that let's [Music] dive happy New Year welcome into 2025 super excited to get rocking on these YouTubes again you probably noticed if you're a if you're a a loyal follower of elite golf schools we haven't posted these on the regular over maybe the last quarter of 2024 and what we're going to start doing is we're going to start posting these a heck of a lot more on the regular and what my oath to you is is this look like the reason that we make these videos in the first place is so that we help you through this wonderful craft this wonderful game and if we can make a video and you watch it and it resonates with you and you apply those principles and it proves your game man I tell you what I'm dying a freaking happy man so my oath to you we're going to post these more at minimum two times a month and what I want to do and we've talked about this when we first started building this channel out is we're going to swim with you here we'll point the ship in the direction based on what your needs are kind of a shared like I also want to post what's really fascinating to me as well so that it continues to come off authentic and we're not just trying to make you like watch some random random freaking video it's more about helping you because of the passion that we have for the game and helping you but as well man I tell you what when we get great questions from you it helps us with the content that we are creating and it's going to help the general population of golfer as well as you so please ask questions comment on here drop us a line on what you'd like to see in in future videos and I tell you what if it hits Us in the heartstrings man we're going to start to move that ship in that direction so that we're helping you big time so with that being said we're going to speak directly to the forward swing and the differences really between these two types of golf swings these two ends of the spectrum that we speak on often and describe each and what these players are really sensing and seeing being in their golf swings and the big anatomical lesson today is how the golf club is moving in space based on uh or relative to two different planes in our body now we'll put we'll put these up in this video as well so you can see exactly what we're speaking to but very easy to uh just look these up and you'll you'll see this wonderful image of just a homie standing here with two different planes now there's multiple planes there's three different main planes that we can speak to um when describing different axes on the body but the two that we're speaking to today the sagittal plane which would be perpendicular to my shoulder axis and the coronal plane which is parallel to the shoulder axis this is also important today I am speaking purely to the axis of the shoulders not to the axis of the hips so when we're looking at this sagittal plane the golf club for every single High Lev player will set up generally on the sagittal plane it's not like we set up in the golf clubs over here on the coronal plane again shoulder axis coronal plane sagittal plane now is this like massive hot debate right on like shallowing should you shallow it should you not well the first question that you should be asking yourself is all right this term shallowing shallowing relative to what and for the most part out there when you hear of shallowing we're talking about this 2D plane that we've just like placed in there on a player's body okay and most of the time this 2D shape is the plane the swing plane from down the line You'll either see a plane through the shaft or through the like the hosle of the club and then running right through my shoulders and it just is goes up here into Infinite Space now I'm not speaking to shallowing relative to that plane ever I'm speaking about shallowing relative to the shoulder Axis or the coronal plane in my trunk now I've got news for you every single player on earth shallows the golf club but they shallow the golf club relative to the shoulder AIS that's the big key that's the big understanding that I need players to see and it's pretty easy to see this because if we swing it to the top here we always hear about this like big turn whatever right so the shoulder axis of the coronal plane is being rotated here so now my coronal Axis or my coronal plane is pointing off in this space where at the address position it's pointing more out towards the target so in the back swing relatively the golf club is swinging up the sagittal plane to work into the back swing and you'll see this on on tour almost every single player will rotate their trunk and they're rotating this coronal plane away away away and then the arms swing up the sagittal plane here so right here if I just lifted the arms notice how my sagittal plane is pointing towards the camera when I turned and I point and I'm over here now my sagittal plane is pointing towards the camera and the golf club is relatively on that sagittal plane now working into the forward swing here is the main map that I need players to better understand and even though players like Justin Rose and Des Shambo are talking about how they sense or they feel like their arms are lowering here so in essence they're going keep your back to the Target keep the sagittal plane pointing in this space you lower your arms and then you turn that's a map that you see very often now even though that might be a sensation or a feel that players have and there's players that obviously lower the hands more than others we'll talk about why we see this difference in the through swing and like the the fully released position kind of out at uh roughly p8 okay which is the shaft being level to the ground through the hit we see generally two different looks and releases we got guys that look like Phil Mickelson VJ Singh Justin Rose at that p8 position and then we've got guys that look like Lucas Glover Neeman Hogan havent and they look different at that position and when we're speaking about this idea of stability stability in our book in our mind is the the the the club hands and arms all relative to one another and in general can we keep or maintain that same structure through the hit that's a very precise look at of controlling the golf club through the head if we're restructuring the arms the hands in the club that becomes more difficult to manage that hit space the the control of the bottom out goes out the out the door and Big Time the thing that we lose the most is the face and understanding where the face is in space through this hit which would be sorry a massive problem to have so looking at this this idea of lowering the arms down the sagittal plane and then turning in actuality players don't do this as much as they think that they do even though it might be a great feel or a good M for them to be able to control the hit it's not what's actually happening and this comes back to this idea of shallowing shallowing the golf club we see this and we'll see this from everybody from about the P3 position to the P5 position so if I'm back here P3 is where the lead arm gets level to the ground okay to quickly go through the P system P1 is addressed P2 shaft level to the ground P3 lead arm level to the ground P4 end of the away swing P5 lead arm level to the ground again P6 shaft level p7 impact p8 shaft level of the ground so from P3 to P5 we will see the golf club and this is just I'm just speaking to high level players here so it's not every play in the world world it's every highle player in the world the shaft of the golf club where it is in space relative to the shoulder axis so again at P3 for high level players almost every one of them will be pretty darn close to 90° either at 90° or a little bit shy of that so right now my coronal plane is here and the golf club will be relatively up this sagittal plane it's on my sagittal plane my sagittal plane is is pointing over here so the golf club is generally in this space now once we get to P4 and then I start to drop and turn out of here we'll notice the sagittal plane all of a sudden is only over here here's the coronal plane sagittal plane's here at P5 is we at P3 it was all the way back here so relative to the P3 position where I'm here now and some players even at P5 are darn near their sagittal plane is almost back to where they we're at the address position right here my Sagal plane's pointing towards the camera it's almost back there again at this point and the golf club has organized relative to that so even though they might feel as if they're lowering their arms and they probably are actively lowering their arms Justin Rose actively lowers his arm this lead shoulder complex goes into extension for him more rapidly than other players that sorry we generally prefer when we're educating the golfing population on how to move the instrument relative to their body so point is the golf club it's General shape this whole tool relative to my coronal plane has shallowed every single player on earth that's worth aorn does this with them actually noticing that they're doing it or not so now let's speak to the actual map in our mind okay and looking at the structure of the arms through the hit with players that we absolutely prefer so let's take hlin for example here we see the structure of the arms hands and Club at p8 in darn near the same position that he started at a dress with so if I'm here this is my address position with the arms I'm saying Vin looks like he's in here so in essence his ribs coronal plane has rotated almost pointing um uh perpendicular to the Target here sagittal plane at the Target and his arm structure is right out in front of him now if I took that and just turned it back so the sagittal plane is pointing perpendicular to Target so at the address position look how similar that is and from down the line if I do that look at how radically the handle of the golf Club is is arcing through this hit now here's the main point of today's discussion to finally get to this if my idea of the golf swing as soon as I start to swing into the forward swing is to lower the arms and then turn what I'm going to do is get my hands close to me Rose talks about trying to get the handle of the golf club into his right hip pocket like you'll see him almost shallow the golf club this way he's trying to shallow but he's moving These Arms down that sagittal plane and doing so see how deep the hands are at P6 is what he is describing if I do this with any amount of force or dynamic as I turn what it's going to do through the hit is shoot the handle out in this space so the handle of the club from P6 to PA is very gradual in its Arc so what will move from here and almost move directly at the target from those two positions what that means is a restructuring of the arms the hands in the club and in the club face we'll see this heavy tumble where the club face is radically closing through there compared to a player like havin now here's the difference in havin vers Rose in order to lower the club head Rose lowers the arms whereas havland will move the golf club lower by riding it down the coronal plane meaning this way now if you're taking a look at the handle right here and its elevation boom see how it doesn't it doesn't actually lower that much when I'm doing this and what I what I mean like what I'm doing here is primarily in in in this lead shoulder internal rotation there's a bit of ab duction and if you look at the elevation of this lead elbow it actually stays a lot higher while I do this this act this elbow actually works up in order to make the club head work down now when I do this notice how the club Works down the coronal plane this is like the craziest wackest thing ever every time that I describe this it's like oh my gosh this is not an intuitive move this is also why we don't see a wealth of players on tour do this because from a young age doesn't make sense to swing the golf club up here actively lower it and actively try to square the golf club and when I do this I'm moving the club Behind Me and the club face isn't squaring relative to the Target now this whole idea here like I've posted some videos on Instagram and I mean people right on there all kinds of different things feel verse real that's ridiculous blah blah blah blah blah this is ridiculous if I move the golf club just this way without moving my body at all now here's the map for this move I've turned my coronal plane is now perpendicular to the Target rather than parallel to it so I'm here if I'm going to move the golf club down this coronal plane I need to move the golf club the the coronal plane and rotate it 180° all the way over here now the golf swing is a proximal to distal act the full swing is a proximal to distal act so if I'm over here and I've rotated my chest golf club's back here relatively on my sagittal plane right now the ribs need to rotate first and the and the golf club its Force Direction down this coronal plane would respond to it so as soon as I start rotating there goes the golf club working down the coronal plane and now I'm here but look my coronal plane's here look at where the club face is I'm riding this club face down this coronal plane in the forward Direction in the forward swing okay notice how I'm not trying to lower it and square the club face here I'm going this way and then into the hit this way now here's the difference in your body's rotation again today we're speaking relative to the shoulder axis not the hip axis players that are actively lowering this lead arm and rotating the club face with this lead arm their trunk and their head have to stall and almost work in the opposite direction we'll see this out of rose as he lowers this he'll move his pelvis up and forward in rotation but his trunk and his head his c-spine rotates in this direction see where my head my skull points so at the strike we'll see this look this is Rose through the hit havland through the hit minwoo through the hit you'll see this look see where my head is now my eye sockets are pointing here my dome's pointing here my coronal plane in my in my shoulder axis has opened more comparatively to adjustin row also look at the trunk difference if I'm rotating purely rotating this and my pelvis is staying underneath me look at where my trunk is in space see my trunk's Axis here compared to Rose who pushes this up look at my trunk axis here two totally different looks it makes the Foot Action different your leg actions different your hip actions different extension's different all of this is different but what I'm saying and bringing to light here is all of that stuff is just a reaction based on the players movement in the club relative to the coronal plane the back swing the club works up the sagittal plane the forward swing the club works on the coronal plane that's the ideal map for multiple different reasons back swing forward swing up the sagittal down the coronal up sagittal down coronal if I turn first I'm rotating the coronal plane here comes the sagittal plane the golf club can work up if I rotate that sagittal plane towards the Target and I let the club work down that coronal plane I look right in here and even through the hit if players get right here it's not all of a sudden that you need to square it with your arms and hands you continue to turn and let the arms stay working in the same general direction we're not actively tossing that Golf Club out as a matter of fact most players that get here what I would like them to do is stay in this internal position here with this lead humorous and this becomes the release this is not the release all this external throw there goes the club head I've got to stall this to be able to do that cuz if I continue to rotate the chest and do that I'm going to hit it behind me it it would go so far left as a right-handed player now if I'm in here it's on my sagittal or it's on my coronal plane and I continue to turn that coronal plane boom there's impact from here if I just let this stay in that same internal shape and it rides right up my sagittal plane now because my sagittal plane if you're the target would be right here boom this becomes the hit see this arm structure this is the arm structure into the hit we don't have to now throw it to square it what's squaring it is the continued rotation of the coronal plane in the shoulder axis so putting this into action I'd love you to practice back swing transition into P6 from here continue to rotate that coronal plane while at the same time now all we're going to do is let both this structure stays the same but both shoulders just go into flexion here and this becomes the release if I continue to turn the chest and make that same action that's the release of the golf club H these really chippy shots sagittal plane coronal release sagittal plane coronal release but notice I'm never tumbling the golf club out even when I get in here it's not release it continued turn with the trunk and now from here both arms go into that flexion position here there that's the most stable position that we would see and if you look at this from face on sagittal coronal continue to turn continuing to turn that coronal and go in here where those arms go into flexion obviously the golf club is going to shoot out a bit look at this structure here this is the hit look at how much that resembles the arm structure meaning the humorous bones relative to the rib cage they're maintained for so much longer compared to me looking to lower down the sagittal there goes the pelvis trap the the the head and the trunk back and rotate here this is a totally different look compared to where I started so point is it's not this feel versus real look when we're moving the golf club down this coronal plane this looks whack as I'll get out if I don't do anything with my body so if I turn my trunk and make the same move boom not whack anymore this is the head with the arms continue to turn the trunk there's all the way through into the finish and again once I'm in here the golf club's going to release in the hands in the wrist complex it'll release but we're not actively lowering this lead arm to Tumble the golf club and square it continuing to turn this CH this chest in here is what we're doing the club is going to release but look at the difference in the Arc of the handle and we'll see this in those types of players at about P6 look at where the hands are now watch where they go at p8 see how much they Arc compared to a rose who lowers then turns and the golf club gets thrown out here so instead of the the hands getting close and then away we want the hands to stay in front they'll automatically be away because this is right in here I'm not trying to throw this out here it's just because my chest rotation see where they are now see as I rotate the chest where the hands go but it doesn't toss the club over it's on my coronal plane if I keep turning the hands go from away to close when we're looking down the line and that's the difference that we're seeing guys from these two different looks of athletes the G Rose dambo crowd who actively lower the golf club and actively lower the arms verse players who swing the golf club and move the golf club on this Corona plane actively havin Neiman Meo will see a totally different look at p8 even at p7 in both of those athletes so what I encourage you to do is we start to play with an idea of where we're sending force in in the golf club relative to these two planes the sagittal plane and the coronal plane if you train this on a day-to- day on the dayto day not only are you going to increase your odds for healthy body mechanics just because of this idea of the shoulder axis and where you're sending the golf club but it's so much easier to control the face and control the bottom M and control the pressure that you're putting on the ball on a rep by rep basis drop your questions below I know there's going to be a ton of them on this video and I can't wait to answer them and can't wait to hear you guys work through these Concepts talk to you soon send some thumpies for me let's go\n",
      "all right a bit of a hotly debated topic today we're talking spine movement and why the spine moves in certain ways throughout the entirety of your golf swing let's [Music] dive all right taking a look at the spine today in the golf swing and the spine is freaking awesome because you can do all this different stuff right it can go into flexion States extension States obviously it can rotate and it can laterally bend so it can really do any number of these things and any combination of these three items and this topic is hotly debated right in our game what's healthy movement in the spine and what's not and it seems like every coach every instructor that you go to has a different idea of what that truly means and what we need to see in the golf swing in order to Pres Reserve back health so if we're looking at this though let's first take a look at us as human beings we are vertebrates just like lizards snakes if you watch babies crawl they're always bending lateral Bend folks is a fine thing if you bend your spine in the appropriate way it's absolutely healthy you are a vertebrate we're designed in this way to be able to move and our spine is accommodating for those those certain actions and certain movements now I'm also not saying that there's no such thing as back injury in our game obviously it's it's a prevalent item when we're looking at injury in our game typically it is back spine Health that's the correlator um that that produces this injury prevalence in our game and typically what we're hearing is lower lower back Health that's the issue so when we're looking at this let's first ident identify like what's actually going on in the spine to create the damage here so we're looking at the three different areas of the spine we've got up on top here we've got the C spine cervical spine we go down a little bit now we're in the t-spine thoracic spine and we're down here into the lumbar or the L spine now if we're looking at the L spine the L spine lumbar spine is designed to go into certain amounts of extension and flexion States kind of period there it is not designed to rotate those those discs those vertebrae rather are are not designed to rotate in heavy amounts they're also not designed to go into lateral Bend in heavy amounts so what we're looking to do is allocate rotation and allocate side Bend in different regions and the higher up you go on this like let's just call it a a a a tree trunk the higher up you go the more pliable we have more pliability we have up in these like higher regions like let's take a look at the c-spine for example if I wanted to turn my head this way or turn my head this way for most folks pretty easy thing to do and so as you leak down into like the t-spine you still have the ability to go ahead and rotate fine in here this is all t-spine rotation as well as lateral Bend if I take my head again my c-spine goes this way side to side I can do this with relative ease and it's okay for me to do that in a generally healthy way so if we understand this just knowing that first off is a great place to start just the design of our spine and again just to kind of finalize this to take one step back before going to the next next item here injury in our game typically typically not always comes from excessive lateral Bend in the elpine as well as excessive rotation in the elpine and so what that causes is is inflammation because the space between our facet joints as you're going down the spine shrinks if I'm going lateral Bend will start to get these faet facet joints pinching and impeding space and as soon as you do that that creates cellular damage cellular damage immediately um is a cause for for inflammation and now we have pain that results as pain so this is part of the reason why we are always advocating for a certain amount of pelvic drop what does pelvic drop allow for it is ex in a way elongating the spine so that the space between my vertebrae the facet joints is is is adequate so as I move as obvious ly I'm going to turn I'm a golfer I'm going to rotate as I do that I have enough space in in the areas in the regions of my spine that's needed to preserve the health of my back or my spine so when we're looking at this in the golf swing typically what we see is in healthy patterns we see some amount in this transitional space of this this Trail hip working into into more flexion because of the drop now drop is is not me standing here and and performing a straight leg deadlift right if I'm right here and I'm just going hinge and back up this is not what I'm what I'm advocating at all what I'm advocating is more of a squat type of pattern so if you go into the gym you have a trainer that's worth AAR and every one of them goes okay eyes to the ceiling and now as you squat the knees cannot pinch pitch forward so in essence my knees aren't going in this space I'm keeping the knees where where they are in space head up drop my booty now if we just take a look at this my spine is in a bit more extension at that point than I started at now what's extension what's flexion in the spine think of flexion is more like rly pulley mode so I'm taking my pelvis tucking it under I'm taking my chin and tucking it into my chest and I just keep rolling in here this is like excessive spine flexion if I go the opposite way where my head starts to to work up and I drop my booty my spine is now moving into more of an extension State there so dropping okay and again like taking a step back our spine is designed our L spine our lumbar is designed to go into some amount of flexion and extension States it's completely fine to do so very healthy pattern now if I'm going to drop appropriately here and work my spine in this manner what that does is that creates more hip flexion and we want this this to happen in this transitionary space so really as the golf club is continuing to climb up and away here and we see this out of our favorite movers what we'll see is a dropping in the pelvis a squat pattern as the handle or the golf club or my arms continue to rise so if I'm going here see how the handle continues to rise and I'm starting to drop and if you notice see how my knees are not pitching in this space and if you watch my booty it invades this wall if you will this is kind of a hot topic now for a lot of lot of coaches is we draw this line on the player's rump and what we want them to do is at least stay on that wall not come off the wall stay on the wall or invade that wall even greater and that's all because of this drop state in the pelvis so that's number one if we're looking at just general job duties for our body in movement the pelvises main role it's main job is to drop we want that level to drop and so from there if we're looking at more okay how how am I now moving from there to move into the golf ball obviously we need some amount of rotation the main Rotator in the golf swing we talk a lot about this is mostly in the trunk in my rib cage so if I'm taking my pelvis and simply dropping it what I'm doing to move away from the Target and towards towards the target is is always rotating my trunk either away or towards the target so if we're looking at just general like big global maps here we're looking at rotation here in the rib cage if I'm looking at my spine and what what region of my spine is rotating now it's absolutely in in the thoracic I'm not rotating down in here this is more I'm I'm allocating lumbar rotation again no no if I'm up here thoracic rotation much healthier pattern so items that get people in trouble we talk we talk about hip depth a lot if players immediately are looking to get this hip deeper leans into that unhealthy pattern because I'm allocating rotation in that lumbar spine instead of rotating in the thoracic in my trunk to start to move away so we're looking at General sequencings here the start of the golf swing would come from a rotation in my rib cage thoracic rotation as I'm finishing this rotation in the back swing and my arms start to elevate that's the start of transition that's when I'm dropping so if I'm going in here if I'm moving in here now all the sudden I'm starting to look nice the pelvis is dropping at the same time what we're going to see is if the arms are elevating so again this is just simple shoulder flexion is what makes the arms Elevate and work up as I'm doing that if I do this with enough speed and even like shoulder flexion can just be this this this map of where I'm moving the arms away and I talk about this and one of our other videos I think it's titled uh don't raise the arms in the golf swing that's an interesting title but in essence what we're talking about is sending energy in the handle or in my hands away from me so I'm not necessarily actively trying to raise my arms they will just because the force direction that I'm sending in the handle or in the golf club is always level away if I do that with enough speed look at what happens to the arms now if you look at this if you just watch my spine as I'm making this action notice how my spine all of a sudden starts to work into a into more extension now I'm not saying that we need to get crazy here and actively move the spine into excessive extension here I'm not saying that at all but we see this again out of our favorite movers look at Victor hlin in this transitional space like as he's going from roughly P3 which is where the lead arm is level to the ground all the way up into the top at P4 the arms are elevating that's going to take him into more C and t-spine extension at the same time I'm dropping my pelvis my entire spine is elongating in that extension pattern so if we're looking at this we're going from here transition the arms continue to swing away from me as I start to drop and now all of a sudden look at what the back and what the spine starts to look like we see it elongate we see it move into into passive extension not active extension I'm not actively trying to sit here and like bang up my spine by actively moving in an extension it's because of the combination of the arms Rising lifting elevating as I drop the pelvis and move into more hip flexion when we do that we see the spine the entirety of it in Great movers our preferred movers starts to move into extension if we take another step back and just look at what the setup really provides and what it looks like to get my arms and we see this out of all players really the arms need to be out in front of my trunk in order to do that my scapula go around my rib cage into into what would be considered scap protraction they go around me here to get my arms out in front anytime I'm feeling this like scap protraction is almost like this bare hug look like both arms are going around me this way to get my arms on top of my chest just this look notice how my t-spine even my c-spine moves into more flexion compared to a neutral state if you're in a cable row machine pulling the scal the scals now retract that makes the spine go into more extension we're sure as heck not here at the address position we're more in this space here with the scaps protracting humorous bones get up on top of my trunk in front of my trunk in this anterior space so now I can hold the golf button so what we see out of again preferred movers is a bit more flexion state in the sepine so the eyes start to point down and it leaks into my my t-spine to accommodate for where I need the arms to be at setup now we just talked about how we move we're starting to turn here the rib cage is is in charge of a lot of that rotation t-spine is is in charge a lot of the rotation early in the back swing rotating here as I continue to rotate arms Elevate and my pelvis drops now I move into more of an extension state in the spine but I don't stay in that extension State the reason being is as I turn here I'm looking to shoot my arms all the energy comes out of my trunk perpendicular where my trunk is in space in general so if I'm shooting energy away from me here my scals go back into protraction because I'm shooting all this energy out what do protraction leak into in the spine back into flexion so it's amazing just kind of taking a breath here as we're talking through this the spine we've talked about rotation in the spine and we've talked about extension and flexion states in the spine it does a ton the spine does a ton in the golf swing without us really recognizing it or knowing it and again most of this discussion here I don't want folks going out there and like okay I need to move the spine into extension and flexion and rotate it's this like complicated map it's just the point of this is a better understanding that staying in posture in the golf swing is a lot of ways a very misunderstood statement because people think all right I'm going to lock my spine down and I'm just going to rotate this thing around this way and just I mean just looking at that it's like that's not that's non-athlete mode the spine when we see great movers we see this like beautiful Cadence in the spine it's like lizard mode snake mode vertebra mode you can move this spine it can laterally bend which we're going to get into in just a second here but it can da absolutely go into certain amounts of flexion and extension States based on the combination of movements in in your golf swing and it can absolutely rotate in certain areas of the spine throughout certain areas of the spine now moving into lateral bin massive Hot Topic right the golf swing is 100% like again in our preferred map 100% a hitter type pattern so what's the difference between a throwing type pattern and a hitting type pattern pretty simple in that a throwing type pattern is always moving an object in space so if I had the golf club and I moved it over the top here just like I would like a baseball or a football the scapula is elevating and protracting meaning it's going across and above here this way this is the active throw and so the look of the Spiral tissue how it how it moves I in order to throw I would have as I Elevate here see how the spiral tissue elongates here and then goes over okay so this is an over pattern a hitting pattern is more moving an object in space below my center of mass so Hockey baseball golf all hitting type patterns Sledgehammer axe if I'm going this way that's a that's a hitting type pattern okay imagine taking an Axe and it if I went up and over to hit downward that would be a throwing type pattern if I'm more looking to hit like a tree level here this is more a hitting type pattern so if we're just looking at this the scap scapula in hitting patterns in our in the forward direction if I'm looking to hit the scapula would retract depress and protract this way so it's under under we call this under spiraling under spiral see how this spiral tissue is is is Motoring in order to move me in a space where I can hit underneath my center of mass th throwing type patterns again retract Elevate scap elevation protract so I would go this way that's the main difference in the two now if we're looking at that spine Bend lateral Bend in the spine happens because of this move and if we're looking at the scaps so again the scaps are just these wings that sit right back behind you your shoulder blades in a in a hitting pattern if I'm retracted here and this the scap is depressing meaning the scap is working down and then protracting just looking at the axis of my shoulders and looking at the axis of my hips they are different see how level here and how tilted I am here now that is absolutely lateral bent but notice what where it is like all the activity a lot of the activity is up here in my sh it's because of the shoulder blades so the bend that we're going to see is between the shoulder blades what region of the spine is that that's the t-spine and it leaks up even into the c-spine and you'll see players look like this like there're c-spine starts to laterally bend here as they start to hit so this entire C and t-spine if I'm in here there goes the depression State look at what my my my sepine looks like look at what my skull looks like and I start to look in here that is the shape that we're seeing out of wonderful movers again drop State now as I start to move this spiral look at my ey line my ey Line's here c-spine Bend goes into the t-spine but in between really right underneath the shoulder blades all the way down into L5 lumbar five vertebrae five all the way there very very stable when it comes to rotation and it comes to lateral Bend so what does that mean that means a heck of a lot better chance for you to stay healthy in your movement so a lot of this discussion here is not mythbusting it has nothing to do with that it has to do with just moving the needle in your favor when it comes to healthy movement and at the end of the day that's what we're looking for folks is is for you to move in a way that makes it easier for you to control the instrument what the golf club's doing through the HP where the face is where the path is the bottom out you can do it with speed all the things that make you feel really good as a as a player as a golfing athlete but also at the same time if you are moving in a way that's healthy shoot you can play golf until you're 85 and these thresholds are different for everybody I mean some people are highly pliable others aren't that's okay you can still have the same type of map in your mind in movement and mo motoring the golf club in space and and maintain this wonderful healthy pattern so working this in easiest ways to do this understand this is the hit feel the scap it goes retract depress protract there's the hit if I'm turning the chest while I'm doing that there's the hit what does that do to the club shape so it would go on top of the plane under and out on top under out but notice how I'm rotating the chest look at this Trail Gap it's in this space as I'm doing that I can be dropping the pelvis so I'm going chest rotation drop pelvis scal and ribs rotate and that's the hit so we'd go turn now as this lead arm elevates to get me to the top I'd be dropping there goes the lead arm Elevate I'm dropping now if I go scap and ribs there's the hit so we'd go back swing transition scap and hit if we just buff that off just that map I'm here there see how simple we see this wonderful bounce to this system too chest pelvis chest where's the club motoring chest under because of that beautiful scap work but the spine maintains this beautiful healthy vertebrate type movement that that allows you to move with all the freaking precision and speed that you want in a very healthy manner kind of some deep Dives in here ask questions follow us subscribe we are here the only reason again that we're doing this is we want somebody you to watch this video get inspired by movement go out to your range Implement some of these maps and hit better and better shots but again especially in this video doing so in a healthy manner go with some thumpies people let's go\n",
      "Okay, here we go. Today we're talking about what truly shallows the golf club in the golf swing. Let's dive. All right, so big deep dive today for sure. We're going to talk about rib cage, the scaps, the upper arms, humorous bones, and how that entire system really works together. And it's pretty fascinating, too, because I mean, oftent times when we're talking with athletes and students and we're looking at the rib cage, most folks think the ribs are all kind of designed just in general the same. And they're not. We have upper ribs, we got lower ribs, we have floating ribs, which is like, okay, it's a different look at just how the rib cage operates and what those ribs can do, like how they're how they're designed, how they function. But then that really leaks into scapula, leaks into the upper arms. The shoulder complex is is crazy. We've got four bones in there. The acromian, the humorous, the scalp, and the clavicle, and how they interact with one another. So really, it's kind of a complex like system if you're really looking at it like that. But what I'd love to do is really talk about obviously the golf swing in general, the shape that the golf club is is where it should really move in space. But then at the same time, how does our body really support that? So if we just start with the rib cage here and looking at the differences really between the upper rib cage and the lower rib cage and again h how that whole system, if you will, is designed, it starts to become really clear where lateral bend comes from, why the scaps move in space, where the golf club will move in space with all of that. So here we go. So, the upper ribs are fascinating and really the upper ribs, they're kind of hard to uh to really identify because they're they're inside of us right underneath the clavicle and in through the armpit. So, it's tough to actually like feel those ribs. The pecs cover them up. Um, so it's difficult in some ways to really identify and see what that upper rib cage really is doing throughout the entirety of the golf swing. When we think of the rib cage, most of the time we're talking about these guys down here. This is the lower rib cage. The lower rib cage really is its structuring. They're fixed in space, those ribs. And so when we look at them, really there's no leeway when it comes to movement in those ribs and and where they're moving in space. The movement and the mobility is higher up in these upper in the upper rib cage. And how it's designed is fascinating because it's it's designed uh like an accordion. So if the right ribs all clunk together and get closer, these ribs spread apart and and move away from one another. So when we're looking at that, what we can do is we can start to move the rib cage in this manner where we start to see up like almost in the shoulder level. We can start to see like this play where these rib cage the the right rib cage might expand these ribs clunk together and then I can bounce into an opposing movement where these ribs are starting to work apart from one another. Well, why is that important? Well, if we're looking at that, especially from a posterior view, if I go lead ribs start to clunk together and the right ribs start to spa spread apart from one another, what does that do to the spine? Now, I get lateral bend in between my scaps in my T-spine into my for me as a right-handed player into my lead side. So, I have lateral bend or left bend right here. Then I could bounce woo into right bend. So it's interesting because when we look at lateral flexion or lateral bend in the spine, most of the time players think of lateral bend in this manner, whereas I'm showing lateral bend in here. And what's the difference there? Well, one lateral bend in this manner where I'm really not using the rib cage at all in order to create that lateral bend. We're going to have the lateral bend down in the Lspine. So, number one, it's an unhealthy movement. If you do that over and over and over again, your opportunity for injury just goes through the moon. Plus, from an athletic perspective, if I'm doing this business in here, it's really difficult to manage the low point and it shuts off my ability to rotate the rib cage problems for ball striking for multiple different reasons. So looking at at lateral bend from the perspective of L-spine, if I move in this manner, you'll see that the the center of mass of my rib cage move to my right side and I'm also in lateral bend towards my right side. If I move in this manner here with my upper rib cage, these ribs, these upper ribs are starting to work away from one another as the right start to clunk together. You'll see that now the center of mass of my rib cage starts to move into my lead side for me as a right-handed player, but I'm in right lateral bend when I do that. So, it's a totally different map for getting into this trailside bend compared to working into trailside bend in this in this form. Fascinating again, right? So, where is that bend coming from? And how am I moving my body, more importantly, my rib cage in space? So from there, if we start to look at like how that leaks into the scaps. So if I'm in here, one of our favorite favorite drills is this. We we call it the boat drill. So if I'm the hole of a boat and I and I've got this the these ores, and we'll just signify like the shaft over here and the shaft over here is two ores that are right above uh the water level here. If I if I start to move in this manner with the upper ribs starting starting to play, you'll start to see the lateral bends. And you'll also see that I'm I'm working in reverse locomotion. Like when this ore, this right ore gets in the water, where am I sending that energy, moves the energy that way. So my boat would be going that direction. So this little drill in here, notice how when I do this, the pelvis is really quiet and the ribs are the main locomotion for where the ores are moving in space. Now, when we look at that from this posterior view, how does that affect the scaps? You if we just look at the trail scap, my right scalp here, when I'm doing this, you'll see how the scap works down. This is scap depression. then it'll protract and I can I can continue to move it in this way again reverse locomotion but it's the rib cage the scaps and the upper spine that are allowing for that motion to happen. Now when we're looking at the golf swing why is that even important at all? Well, when you look at the best players on earth every single one of them shallows the golf club. Now, let's define shallowing. Shallowing is not this this forced movement where I'm trying to just randomly throw the golf club behind me here. What I'm doing is I'm moving the club in space based on what my body's intent is through the hit. So, if we have an intention of moving the ribs and rotating the ribs through the strike here, well, where would the golf club need to move in space in order for me to do that? And you'll see this a lot where players get up to the top and coaches or even PGA Tour players talk about the arms lowering here and then what they want to do is turn once they get into the space. Well, the dynamic of that doesn't actually happen. Okay. If I move the arms down here, what I've got to do now is I need to move into more of a lateral bend here. You'll notice that my my rib cage all of a sudden stops turning. Okay? and I'll laterally bend to keep the golf club on plane. And the way that I'm going to square the golf club into the strike is now by rotating the arms through the hit. So in essence, the dynamic of this would be arms lowering. This is also shoulder extension. I'm going to move more into a lateral bend type of a move so that now I can go ahead and square the golf club with upper arm and and lower arm rotation. Okay? So, do you see that on tour? Of course you do. But again, if my intention through the hit is to rotate the rib cage, what I need to do is I need to be able to move the golf club in this manner so that as I'm rotating the ribs, the golf club is in the appropriate shape. So, this little boat drill here, where does it look like the golf club's going to move in space when I'm doing that? It's moving behind me. It would shallow relative to my rib cage. So, if I'm in here, boom, there's the same boat drill. Doesn't that look very similar in the ribs, in the spine, in the scalp? So, just sitting here. Boom. And moving in this kind of a shape here. This is what we want in that transition. So, that I've got the golf club deep enough. Now, I could turn in through the strike. So, this is the entire transition. how the rib cage, the spine, the scaps, that leaks into the upper arms, the humorous bones to move the golf club in space relative to my rib cage. So again, if I want to turn through the hit, what I need to be doing through this this transitionary phase, and if we want to look at this more from the P system, P3 is where the lead arm is roughly level to the ground. It'll continue to work up, and then I get back into P5 where the the the lead arm gets back level to the ground. This is all transitionary time and transitionary space. So the look for players that I that I would prefer them to have in their mind's eye is that I'm moving the golf club in this shape so that now I can go ahead and rotate the ribs through the strike. So if I'm here to P3 and I feel this little shape in here, there's the ribs, the scaps, the spine. See how the upper arms move in space because of that intention? It's all proximal stuff. Close to my center of mass. So, if I'm in here, there's the transition. What can I do through the hit? I can continue to rotate the chest through the strike. Compare that to this idea of I get to the top and then lower the arms. See how there's no play in the ribs? There's no play in the scaps. All I'm doing is lowering these arms. I've got to again work into lateral bends. See how if I do this, it keeps the shaft on plane. and I could go ahead and approach the golf ball from the inside there. So, this movement doesn't make sense if I want to turn at the same time because if I turn with that action, where does the golf club go? If I make this movement with the rib cage, the scaps, the upper arms, what can I do with the ribs? I can keep turning. So, that club is relative to me. And every single great player on earth does this. And it's easy to see as well. Just the eye test. Just the eye test of this. If you look at players, doesn't matter who it is, Scotty Sheffler, Walkin Neman, Tiger Woods, Jack Nicholas, every highle player. From the time that they are at, let's just say P2, where the shaft is level to the ground here. This is position two, P2. Look at my shoulder axis here. See how open I am or really to the target. that I'd be fairly closed here with the shoulder axis and the club's right in in here. Now, once I get to P6, which is where the club gets back level to the ground, look at how much more open my shoulder axis is relative to the golf club. So, every player on Earth shallows the shaft plane relative to the shoulder axis, which the shoulder axis is super indicative of what the rib cage is doing. So high level players, their intention is going to be to rotate through the hit. No matter what their mapping is, you see Justin Rose swing it up here and he's like, \"Okay, you just lower it down and then you turn.\" Well, he doesn't look like this at P6. He looks like that at P6. So he shallowed the golf club relative to his shoulder axis or what his rib cage is doing. So again, this transitionary space when looking at the scap, the upper ribs, the spine, that dynamic in this transitionary space is so important based on your intention of hit. If you want to be able to rotate the chest at all through the strike, which you hear that a lot, almost all highle players, they'll talk about their intention of I just want to turn through the strike. No matter if they're going, I want to lower the arms and then turn or if the intention is to move the golf club as I'm discussing here so that then I can turn. The intent is still the same. But the mapping and the understanding of where this needs to move in space relative to the rib cage is so important if that's going to map out and that dynamic is actually going to happen. So let's put this into practice here. So, if we take a look from right down the line here, I'd love players to mess around with just the intention of from again P3ish, how am I moving the golf club in here? And look at the direction of force like where that golf club is moving. I'm moving it down this rib cage line, but I'm gently turning the rib cage. See how the pelvis is staying underneath me so that I can continue to turn, but I'm still feeling a lot of this same boat drill in here. Boom. Okay. So, if I pump that a couple of times just dynamically, boom, ribs, that whole boat feel, where's the club moving in space? Once I feel that I'm in there, in there, and I continue to turn the chest. Once you have a better understanding of that, could make this a little bit more seamless where I'm back here again at roughly P3 and then I'm going in there to go ahead and hit it. But look at the dynamic of the club's shape in space. What I'm doing in this area, in this region, in order to move it there, and I'm looking to continue to rotate the chest through the strike. Once I've done that a few times, hit these really chilled out shots where in transition, look how long that took. But you can see again the intention is to turn and rotate the rib cage and my trunk through the hit while organizing the club in that transitionary time. Massively important here. Just get better with that. You just put more energy in through the hit and we're in full swing. But again, biggest importance here. Where do I want the club to move in space relative to my rib cage, especially in transition? So, that sets you up for an easy hit where you can continue to rotate. Biggest idea here is the upper rib cage, the scapula, the humorous bones, the upper arms, their dynamic in that space is the most important portion of this video. So, it helps you with the intention of the hip. So, please put this into action. Play with it a little bit. Comment below. Let us know your findings because I'll be super interested. And those comments also help me with videos that we're going to make in the future so that we help you play better golf and hit great shots. Also, make sure to hit that subscribe button. We're going to start putting out content more and more with the intention again to level up your game. Stay tuned. More to come on this. Thanks so much for watching.\n",
      "Let's go. We're so excited to rock with you today and talk about what it truly means to move like an athlete in your golf swing. >> Let's go. >> Jackson Wary, >> what up Gunit? >> How you doing? >> I'm doing great, man. We get to talk a little golf today, which makes me super duper happy. >> And I think it What's What's interesting always, right? We This is like some some of at least my beef. Maybe I won't speak for you on in on golf instruction. You tell me what you think, but there's all these like isms, you know, like, \"Hey man, your golf swing looks really good. Just make me a golf swing in rhythm now. Show me good rhythm.\" >> Right. >> Right. And you're like, \"Well, what does that mean?\" It's almost like, \"Okay, well, you know, oh, your forward swing looks nice. Just show me a good back swing. >> Well, just do it. >> What's What's the freaking tempo to that? What are the pros to Yeah. >> Exactly. Exactly. So, what we're going to speak to today is another one of our beefs uh with golf instruction. Um, we love golf instruction so much. >> Don't take that necessarily the wrong way, but it's easy for us as coaches to just like drip out these like ideas, but there's not really a map to go with it. So, it's like, well, it's up for interpretation. So, we're going to speak to athletics in the game. >> Love that. >> Right. And I'm speaking to a super high level athlete. Jackson, if you don't know, has a a big background in baseball, uh, as well as golf. What other sports? >> Uh, I did a little bit of basketball, uh, football when I was younger, but baseball main thing. Yeah. >> Underwater basket weaving. You just checked all the boxes. >> We bowling. >> Yeah. My background is is in there as well, like when I when I was younger. Much younger. Um, basketball, football, baseball, golf. So, just a couple of jocks here, bro. Couple of jocks. So, >> what's nice is like if you have like kind of a half a half a grain of freaking athletic DNA in your body, >> this stuff will resonate really well with you just because it does feel good to move well. Okay. And before we get too deep into this today, um I want I want want to make sure that whoever is watching this, you're watching stuff that will help like organize all this in your mind. And there's one there's a couple of different associations, people, whatever you want to call it, >> um that have been really instrumental to us as coaches to better understand this idea of athleticism. Um, Luke Brachie helped point me in the direction of a of a a company organization called GOTA. If you watched a bunch of our videos, we talk about GOTA quite often. Uh, God stands for greatest of all time athletes. And what's funny, I I think it's super comical anyways, is that anybody that doesn't move in a GOTA type of a a mapping, they'll they'll call those individuals or those athletes was, >> which is so funny. So, who they're throwing in there, by the way, is like LeBron James, Zion Williams, which are I'm sorry, they're great athletes, right? But the the issue is is and what Goa really has has has studied a ton and where God arose from is just health of movement. Um, and so when they're studying these de different demographics of folks and people, um, they're taking a look at at at these f folks that move in similar ways. And what they found is it just very much li limits or eliminates their chance of getting injured based on their movement. >> Now that >> right exactly. And so we're fortunate enough like >> our golf psychos that come in and work with us either playing professionals or our junior academy um folks that fly in to come work with you or myself they'll come in and I'll get these funny texts. They're like, \"Coach, you'd be so happy. You'd be so proud of me. I hit 267 seven irons. That is the craziest coolest thing. So when we're when we have like the fortune of working with these kinds of folks, it would be a big massive disservice for us to impart movement patterns that if you if you rep it a ton is going to move the needle in your favor of getting injured. >> Problems. >> Don't like that. All right. So, um, what we're going to really tie in today is is is go. We might talk a little bit to to an individual, uh, named David Wet who came up with a ton of, uh, rope exercises as well. Really like helps you with an understanding of the rib cage and how it moves in space, blah, blah, blah. So, pardon me if you know me at all. I'm a squirrel and I'll be all over the place today. But hopefully this these ideas, these concepts as Jackson and I are painting in here and trying to to give you a good understanding of the landscape of athletics in the game. Hopefully it makes some sense here. So without further ado, >> let's get into it. >> Let's dive into the mother flipper. All right. So what we're going to start with, let's start from the feet and then we'll migrate our way up. Now what's really cool, Jackson, don't even think and just walk towards the camera. Start all the way back here. Don't Don't think I'll hold this. You just walk. Just walk like you're walking down the freaking Jackson walks like a boss. He makes me so happy and he makes me so jealous because he he walks and moves so well. >> You've made me aware of it. >> Yeah. Yeah. Luke and all of us. Right. So, biggest thing like when Jackson's walking, take one step towards the camera there for me. Very nice. So when you look at Jackson right now, the pressure number one, when he's walking in his gate pattern, narrow columns, so almost looks like he's tight roping, like he's not walking into the gym freaking big old wide wide body, right? >> And when you do that, it makes it much easier for the pressure to be on your outer edge or the outstep of your foot, not on the instep. You'll also see how this foot, he's got outer edge, his last three toes, >> metatarscils are all that's where the pressure is, right? So we're not on the big toe. Nope. >> You on the big toe here? >> No. >> No. Outer three. Outer three. You'll also see this heel is thrown away from Jackson's midline. It didn't spin into into him in show the the a wo pattern with the heel. See like >> there you go. So see how this this spins in and immediately where's that pressure in your foot? >> Inside big toe >> inside. Okay. So God will talk often about uh and they have the this is also part of the fun with go instead of like all this anatomical stuff that we sometimes talk about. >> Mhm. >> Which is deep. >> It's cool but it's it can be heavy. >> It can be heavy. Yeah. >> And sometimes it's like okay there's some big study that needs to go along with this. A lot of uh shoot all of Go's um uh um what's that called? go to uh it's not an acronym. Is it an acronym? >> So they'll go IBH inside ankle bone high. >> Anyways, blank golf coach, don't mind me. >> Brain fart. >> Brain fart. IABH stands for inside ankle bone. So we got inside ankle bone, we got outside ankle bone. If the inside ankle bone is high, where's my pressure? >> Outside. >> Outside. >> Mhm. >> Okay. Now inside ankle bone if we do want to study this like this action right here is a supenation action in the foot. So here we go with the an anatomical okay but supenation really quickly is just inversion. This is everversion of the foot inversion of the foot. So the the the arch of the foot almost climbs up the inseam. Okay. So see how that that move inversion keeps the inside ankle bone high. And then if I throw in internal rotation of the femur, that's going to spin the heel away, which is another go term. H a d heels away all day. I a bh inside ankle bone high. Okay. So, when you're hitting balls, and what we'll do like up here, um, is we'll show you either ourselves making swings or, um, some of our favorite, uh, athletes or PGA Tour players, uh, that that have some of these qualities that we prefer when we're looking at movement. But if we're looking at the feet, number one piece is, hey, can the athlete actually have even in setup inside ankle bones high, not inside ankle bones low? And just the eye test of this, which one looks more athletic? This guy or this cat? Pretty easy to see. And then when we're looking at just general movement here, okay, when I'm moving, can I keep these inside ankle bones high so I'm not crashing and I'm not crashing? This is part of the reason why we don't prefer banking. Right now, you can. It's okay. If you prefer to do that, ignore this video and go move and watch another one. It's completely fine. We're speaking directly to our preferences and movement, but a lot of the reason that we have these preferences again is the health of movement and preserving your body. So, as you're going golf psycho mode, playing a ton of golf, repping, working on your game, you don't injure yourself. >> Exactly. >> Okay. So, along with that, let's actually do this. Jackson, go ahead and hit us one here. This is rep one of the day. So, I'm just throwing you throwing you right in. >> We're going to keep it kind of pitchy. >> Yep. So, let's just throw a pitchy one. Okay. And what I'd love to see, go ahead and just hit one here. But the whole focus is just IBH, inside ankle bones high. So when Jay does that, and one thing I'd love to see, see even there, Jay, how you kind of work on into that into that instep. And so when you're working on this at home, >> these are super pitchy ones. Like that was fairly pitchy. >> But the we don't care about where the golf club's moving. We don't care about the rib cage. Who cares? The only quality Yeah. can you stay on the outer edge? So, if you've got inside ankle bone high, a pretty easy way to do this is just to sense like, okay, I have the pressure here, right on the outside. I've got the pressure here on the outside. Can you just keep the pressure on the outer edge of the foot as you're hitting it? >> That's a little different. Totally different foot action there. >> So different. >> Yep. Absolutely. >> Stable as a mother trucker. >> Mhm. And and big thing. Let's hit one more like that. Okay. >> Stable as a mother trucker. Excellent. And you'll see like Jackson's throwing a ton here. Do one for us again that's like super duper chilled out. Like it doesn't do nearly as much. If anything, it's almost like a hint. Like it's hard for me to even tell. Jay, just show me that. >> Very cool. So now it's like toned down. What Jay just did is super cool cuz you're exploring the space. >> Yeah. How much How much? I went freaking full boore right away. Jackson's also hilarious because the range of motion that this homie has is just ridiculous. Like >> it's not as good as you think. I promise. >> Yeah, homie can move, man. Gumby mode over here. So, um, but that that's it's super important. Like, and again, if if you've taken a ton of golf lessons, if you've watched YouTube, if you scrolled on Instagram, it our game has this tendency for whatever reason to handcuff folks, right? Like the club needs to be a delivery at 43 degrees, not 42, not 41, 43. Right. And we just get into this point where we're just like clunking through space and just trying to hit positions >> there. Exactly. And there's no such thing as positions. We move in and out of space. This needs to be dynamic. That's why I love this go to outlook because all we're sensing is like when I'm moving, i.e. dynamic, I'm moving in space. Then can I throw some of these qualities in like all Jay's talk? Like are you thinking about anything else other than just outer edge? >> No, just outer edge. That's it. >> Outer edge. Okay. Now, let's make uh and let's do this from face on. We won't hit a golf ball cuz that that nice like TV screen over there. We don't want to put a hole through >> on TVs. >> Uhhuh. So, show us one. And you just kind of make this dynamic, Jay, where you're just kind of swinging it back and forth. But every single rep, throw the heel away and away and away. Okay. Okay, now that's again, that's a ton. Go ahead and set up again for us. Just neutral. And then throw some that are just like they just kind of kiss. Each heel just barely floats away. Okay. And the lead one can kind of float away. There we go. So, as Jay's moving like this, what he's feeling, obviously, again, we're dynamic, but we're throwing heels away from Jay's midline. Okay. So, throw show us one that's like inappropriate here where the heels would be thrown towards midline. I didn't think about that. >> Yeah. Right. Yeah. So, even there it just >> hard to do. >> Uhhuh. Exactly. >> Feel right. >> Yep. Yep. So, when when Jay's doing that, hop out of there real quick. I'll show it cuz I can do this real easy. >> So, lot You'll see this a lot like and and this is again preferences. Okay. But I think there's a misinterpretation from like the Sam Sneeed drill where he's got a basket in here and he's trying to drop it. Yep. >> What folks will do is they'll throw duel femur external rotation. Okay, so external rotation, what that does, look at where my heel is going to migrate. Look at where my heel is going to migrate. See how the heel comes into this space? Okay, so instead of that, if I if I'm in here, see how now the heels, they just can slightly migrate away. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. They're never migrating in. Okay, I'm not spinning it in this in this space at all. Okay. So, you were doing this already before, but we'll just change the outlook slightly from IABH, inside ankle bone high to H A heels away all day. >> So, let's hit us one like that. And again, from my optics as just an observer, >> just subtle. >> I just want to like Oh, I can barely see that lead heel kiss and then the trail heel kiss. Just a teeny bit. Excellent. Okay. So why this is important? So we hear about this all the time, right? >> Someone come in, I just early extent, they hate their early extension. I hate early extension. I want to get rid of my early extension. This is the bane of my existence. >> The majority of the time when we're working with somebody in regard to their again big important term here, early extension. Everybody needs to extend. >> You need to extend. We're not saying extension is a bad thing. extension just should happen in our mapping what we prefer at the appropriate time from the appropriate active move which we'll get into okay but most of the time what happens is people know what they want to do in the pelvis and then they'll say I can't do that which is BS >> you can absolutely do >> you can absolutely do it their feet are what screw it all up >> so I know I want to stay dropped I want to rotate in here blah blah blah But what their unconscious mapping is is that foot moves onto the instep here. So again, ever my arch I'm getting slammed to the to the floor. It's not my my foot that's actively doing that though. It's the femur. When this femur adducts, so adduction is just this move here. This is arm adduction. Femur adduction looks like this. See how my knee migrates in here. So now I got a problem. >> Mhm. So the femur adducting what's really happening is it's right in this joint complex right in here in the hip. So what is adduction of the femur immediately affect here >> pelvis. >> Exactly. So now my pelvis slides or migrates towards the target. >> Okay. So if I do too much of that >> doesn't feel good. >> Doesn't even feel good. >> Knee doesn't feel good. >> Exactly. And at the end of the day for us as as golfers, we're gonna freaking rotate. Whether you mean to or not. You're going to rotate. Like I have ne I've never coached somebody that does this at finish. It ain't going to happen. You're going to turn something to move that way and rotate. But if I if I shove this in here and start to rotate my pelvis, now I am rotating my pelvis in extension. Notice how from down the line here, if I go adduction, I'm rotating. See how my pelvis has rotated? My belt buckle's pointing more towards the target here. But what that did, see how now my femur and my trunk line are like one. I look like a dog gone bean pole right here. Okay. So part of what allows like from booty view here if if I'm if let's say if I'm Marian Jones >> go to go to athlete >> go. >> Okay. If I'm Marian Jones on the block and I want to motor forward here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to internally rotate the femur and I'm pushing off of the outer three or the outer edge here. Mhm. >> When I do that, watch where my right booty cheek migrates here. See where my sacrum moves? See where the pelvis moves? My pelvis move this way. Where did my rib cage move? >> Other way. >> There we go. Okay. So, this is a bow and corner from go. If I'm in here and I drop in here, this is a bow. Now, if I if I go internal rotation, outer edge, boom. This is a corner. This shape right in here. See how this entire outer edge for me is cornered out. So all of this outer edge, this is the IT band in all human beings. Okay. What we're doing is this outer edge takes the brunt of a lot of the pressure in the movement in the legs. Well, if I do that effectively, where does my pelvis migrate to? See how my my my my center of mass of my pelvis actually moves towards my right side and my rib cage moves towards my lead side bow and corner. It also leads to go to turn nose over toes. See I've moved over here. So this goes into golf as well, right? Like if I go out to the driving range here at Lone Tree right now and I pick out five people and I go, \"Go ahead and set up and make a swing and move your pressure or move your weight to to your left side.\" What do they do? >> They shove the dog gone pelvis. >> Shove your pelvis. >> And I don't even know why it's that way, right? Like everybody Okay, got it. So immediate adduction, immediate eversion, inside ankle bone, low blah blah blah. So that would freaking everything. Exactly. Low point gets jacked. Blah blah blah blah blah. So, we're super whacked out. Okay. So, that would be like me getting ready to run right towards the camera and I spin this external and push off. See my shape? So, which one looks more athlete mode? This guy or this guy? It's just an eye test as well. What we're trying to do is just explain the eye test. >> Okay. So, when we're looking at this, and this is where like for most folks, as soon as I talk to them about sacred move, the pelvis, they can migrate the pelvis there, but this becomes like a block. I'll move my pelvis, but then I have all my weight over here. >> Yeah. >> Shift it with >> Exactly. So, notice when Jay does that, do that again. >> Boom. See where his rib cage went? Where's your pressure in your feet right now? >> Freaking. >> So, you got more Yeah. And which foot has more pressure on it? >> This guy. >> Exactly. And what percentage would you say? ish. >> Uh, probably 75 >> ish somewhere in there. >> So, it's not a hundo. >> No, I'm not. >> Which is also unathletic, right? I'm not like over here with pelvis and ribs >> cuz I want to hang on here. I got >> Exactly. Exactly. So, Jay, let's do this. Go ahead and show booty view and throw the club down for a second. Okay. And if you're let let's go this way with the the left foot forward. >> Okay. So, if we just go a little bit of pressure here. Boom. Okay. Pressure in the in the femur and the outer edge. There you go. See how this this pelvis gets in here? Jay's right booty cheek here is over more of his right side. If you do that again, this blue belt loop right here, if you watch where it migrates, there you go. And his pelvis go back to neutral will actually move more that way. Right there. See how his right booty cheek now is much higher than the left. This is just gate pattern or ruting pattern. What does that move produce in his spine? Now I have right lateral bend, but his chest is over his left side. Nose over toes. They're saying nose because most of this is based on where your chest goes. So there goes your dome piece. It migrates as well >> instead of keep your head still. Let your head move. >> Exactly. Exactly. >> Sometimes I say that during a lesson is insane. >> Your head should move. You will not find one player on tour, not one, not one that keeps their head still. >> You'll have guys that will talk about that as their intention, which in my opinion is freaking that that is not the correct intention. >> Like, if your spine's moving at all, which it should move cuz we're vertebrates, and if you move it well, then you'll have this like super safe way of movement >> and and you'll be just fine. Okay. So when we're when we're migrating up right up into the pelvis now from the feet through the legs which we talked about with the bows and corners. Now if we're looking at the pelvis and you watch good movers as they walk look at where the sacrum moves. See how it like bumps from one side to the next. It's like bump bump like this big booty Judy look. Boom boom boom. Look at it swim. That's DJ look. So if I'm doing that with my with my pelvis, what you'll see is the pelvis's move. If I'm in here, like now we correlate this to golf swing. So if I go here, so I go outer edge, heel away all day. Look at the pelvis's shape. So where does my L-spine go? It gets shoved over here and it's rotary. So now I'm rotating the pelvis in flexion. So I'm in here, but look at where this L-spine goes or where the sacrum moves. See how that shoves the p the the the the rib cage forward into my lead side? And if I know how to motor the ribs, which we'll talk about here in a sec, I got the whole dog gone map. And now it's like, oh, there's the picture of how we move in golf, right from the floor up. Okay, so finally I'll be back. I promise. Medall. Okay, hold that sucker right in front of you. >> Okay. >> Okay. Piece to to throw out here. Go ahead and get in here. Just uh show Yeah. Yep. Down the line view. >> Show back chain dominance. >> So what back chain dominance is again go to term rib cage. Jackson's center of mass of his rib cage is in front of his center of mass of pelvis which every single player on earth presents that way at setup. >> Yes. Okay. >> We just lose it. >> We just Yeah. It's how fast do we lose it? And that's again the early extension. Okay. So let's go ahead and go go back towards the camera and face. Now, spiral the medball. Good. So, let's just do this with no no uh no booty move. So, go ahead and set up again. Okay. >> So, we'll be right here, Jay. So, we're just going to go right there. There we go. >> So, as Jay's doing this, what you'll notice is if he's in here with the elbows, look at where the elbows migrate. Also notice where nose goes. Nose goes nose over toes. Nose over toes. So when you're watching this, Jay's in right lateral bend right now, but his center of mass of his ribs ribs went forward towards left side. And then if he goes over here, lead lateral bend. Center of mass of his ribs went to his right side. Inappropriate movement. If we go in here, this is in inappropriate movement this way. So now he's in right lateral bend, but his center of mass of his ribs went towards his right side. Okay. Now go to the other side inappropriately. Exactly. So, what we'd have is like this look where I'm just teetering here. So, I'm still having right lateral or left lateral. This happens in the golf swing because of inappropriate feet, inappropriate pelvis. Now, I'm up here. I have to take the rib cage, rotate it counter to the pelvis, and right lateral bend to slot the club. >> Now, I'm in trouble. >> Early extension. >> Early extension. >> Okay. But if I'm in here and I go booty, outer edge, heel away. So the pelvis goes. What can I do with the ball? We can spiral. So we call these this is spiraling the rib cage. Notice as Jay and I are going forward, our center of mass of the ribs goes forward. We get into right lateral bend. Where's your pressure in your feet now, homie? >> Outside. >> That's how you get pressure left, man. That's ged up from the feet up, son. Beautiful look. Beautiful look. So, let's put this all this stuff into action because we talked about faking everything. Okay, we're all the way up in here for you on that. So when we're talking spiraling the rib cage then cuz there's a couple places that we could do it from >> as far as like laterals >> as as far as laterals which I see a lot of us I I know I've done this wrong in the past where I feel like cuz I'm so mobile >> I can get like my L spine way over here and it feels like I'm doing it >> where in rib cage should I feel that? >> Yep. Yep. Exactly. So right there when Jay's doing that do that again what you just showed. Okay. This is where Jay gets his pelvis and his rib cage migrating forward too much. Now we're overloaded here and this bend leaks down into Lspine. So how how our spine is made. I mean almost everybody's seen like what the spine looks like that's watching this. You got these big vertebrae at the base. >> L5 is humongous. >> Big. >> C1 is teeny teeny tiny. Yep. >> Right. So it's like a it looks like a uh like a freaking aspen tree. Mhm. Now, when you watch aspen trees, when the wind's blowing, the base doesn't move hardly at all. It's there for support. >> And up here, this all can go right and we don't go, \"Ooh, that's unhealthy.\" It's when the wind blows too much and now it gets into the base. Now we get unhealthy. Everything splinters. It's exactly, it's just maybe a silly analogy, but that's exactly how our spine >> is built as well. So, what's great here, Jay, like go ahead and go booty view again. Show us back swing in golf. Okay. Now, show us proper outer edge, heel away, pelvis, and ribs, the whole map. Boom, baby. So, if you're there, here, it's super easy to see. Here's Jackson's belt line. This is also relative to to what his um pelvis line is going to look at from right here all the way up to here. Straight. Now look at the look at the line the the the angle the for lack of a better term the tilt of this and then his his bends are in here. This also we've talked about this in numerous other videos. You can check these out so I won't go too deep into this. But Jackson's scap, his trail scap is depressed. His his lead scap is slightly elevated. Okay. So when that happens with the scaps what we're going to get is some side bend in here. So most of the side bend is in the at the base begins at the base of his scaps and then migrates up through his midback or upper back into his up into a C-spine. This is where we want the bend. This is safe. Unhealthy back here. So go ahead and swing it to the top. And then if we show unhealthy movement here. So the pelvis is there and rotated. Bang. Now you can see easy. And you'll feel it here too, Jay. Where the majority of the pivot of the spine is right in here. So now this takes the brunt of it. Migrates up in here as well. Unhealthy because we've got lateral bend, lateral flexion, side bend down in the Lspine. No feel good. Anti-athlete. >> Okay. No, I don't like that there. >> So, yeah. No, thank you. >> No. >> So, when you're looking at this, like how I would suggest that we do this, and we'll do this right now. Jay, go ahead and throw that ball down anywhere and then grab your club again >> and then I'll just throw out a command and just that's the only thing that you're going to think about is that particular action. Y. >> So, let's start with the feet and we'll migrate up. I A BH can be super chippy. >> Great. Let's hit one more. I A BH inside ankle bone high in both feet. Beautiful. Okay. Now, and again, let's see. Let's show this subtle. Show me heel away all day. >> Okay. >> Beautiful. Okay. Now, that's not quite as subtle as we're looking for. and show it in both feet. Like the lead foot lands with heel away. The trail foot gets thrown heel away in the forward swing. Back swing, lead heel, forward swing, trail heel. Beautiful. Okay, now let's go. Like I want you to sense this in the entire in the entire right right leg here because of the pelvis. So if I if I move the pelvis over here already that's going to help IABH and heel away but we'll keep this corner look because of that shape in the through swing. >> Okay. >> Okay. So how does that pelvis how does the sacrum move? There we go. So we're away and then how does that whole right side beautiful and what's cool Jackson's done this a ton. Obviously we talk about this stuff as an academy and as coaches a ton. what he did really well there because you still support you got the low point, right? >> Yep. >> And you brought up low point the other just a little bit ago. There's two different ways to control your low point. This is where pressure moves in the swing. You can either elect to shove the pelvis forward towards the target. And this can be the the the big dictator of low point for you. So you can still control low point to a certain degree. You can get it far enough up there, but it's not a ton. You're going to have these like AOAs that are pretty flat for the most part unless you do something drastic with the arms to make up for that. >> Scotty. >> Mhm. Exactly. Forward. Exactly. Exactly. Which clearly not our preference of moving, >> which is ironic. It shows you that you can be great. Yeah. He's the best ball striker in in today's age, probably over the last decade. >> So, that shows that there's a number of different ways to to to swing and be effective in the game. Um, it's just how you match all that stuff up. But again, we go back to just the health of movement. It scares me because like he's KT taped up over the Masters a couple years ago, last year's playoffs. He's grabbing lower back in the last three events. I'm just like gosh, cuz we love watching him play. He's super dynamic, right? >> As far as like a player, you love to see him at the top of the leaderboard. >> So, but getting back to low point, what else can manage low point for us? The rib cage. Exactly. So, and the purpose of moving the pelvis in this direction as we're discussing here is so it'll throw my spine and my rib cage forward. It's not super easy to tell where's my intention of hit. >> It's freaking out in front of the golf ball >> way the hell up here. Right? If I do this, it's pretty easy to see that like, okay, my intention of hit is here. Unless I do something to make up for that with the arms, which just clutters up a system. Okay. So, let's have one here where and I I need people to do this better because every time I talk about the pelvis, they screw up their low point because the the ribs go with it. That is not how this works. They work in opposition. So, how you see that is so important because you've got to see that be the the reason that we're moving the pelvis and the feet in this way so I can get this forward and control low point. >> I think that's a key bit is everything moves in opposition. I mean, when we're walking >> Mhm. >> I mean, I'm not going to kids all the time, I can't do it. But some of our kids do it, too, where I like I want them to walk and turn their chest >> Mhm. >> into their like lead leg or whatever leg is forward and they go, >> \"God, I >> go this way.\" >> Exactly. >> That I know walk like that. >> Yeah. Right. So, and again, you just see that you get that guy coming into the gym trying to join your basketball your team. You're like, \"Dude, homie, no, man. Like you can you can ride the bench for a long time. >> Yeah. You can go in when I'm not hitting threes anymore. >> Mhm. Right. Exactly. So, let let's hit one here where it the majority of the outlook is your trunk's movement. >> Okay. >> Your trunk's shape is going to be completely dictated by the marriage of the pelvis and the rib cage. And let's show one to start with that's a little bit overdone. >> Okay. >> Okay. So, we're going to overseason the steak a little bit just to experience. But show me that trunk shape. >> Okay. Exactly. Now, let's do it the proper amount. >> Okay. >> And so you'll feel the spiraling of that medicine ball along with that pelvis. Cool. Even dial that down just a little bit. That's almost like all sides of the space. >> I know Jackson's like we joke often with students. We go we either coach like boulders or play-doh. like boulders. I've got to like time a hot kick to make them move just a little bit, right? And they're like, \"I'm moving so crazy.\" And it's like, \"No, here you go.\" And then other guys are like, \"Here's a little taste.\" And they just run with it. >> Play-Doh. >> So, show me the proper amount. Just the proper amount of seasoning. Let's have this taste right. Excellent. That looks great. And again, like what's cool is you watch this. Like if you take a look at that swing, there's something about it without even all the BS of like what we're talking about with IBH and D. You just look at it and you go, I test >> looks good. >> Looks good. It looks right. It looks right. >> Okay. So, what we would really encourage you to do is just play with these ideas, play with these terms, mess with them. I mean, even starting off just going, okay, how would I go? There's the and it's not again we're not cheating because this is external but how would I get that that outer edge here? How would I get the heel away? This is a pretty simple movement really >> like that's not rocket science. It's like okay so I can do that. Can I drip that into the right in the right foot in my golf swing and just hit one? And again if they all don't match up let's say that I do this really well and I freaking have horrible lateral bend. I'll probably just stuff it in the ground back here. So, don't penalize yourself for hitting bad shots. If you're focusing on a movement and you execute on that movement, no matter what happens to the shot, that should be a reward, not a, \"Oh, I screwed it up. There's a penalty. That was horrible because I misit it.\" Takes time to drip all these things, all these different items in so it becomes clear that it's just one movement. It's a shape of movement, which is what we're looking for at the end of the day. And you can go play golf through that shape. So, >> I'd encourage you to also just like I I do this all the time now as I'm watching football highlights and stuff and >> John Elway came up the other day. I'm like his feet are freaking dope. >> He's freaking running all like this and I mean, why the hell do you think he has such a cannon? >> There you go. Exactly. >> Taking slack out really well. >> Loads up tissue lines like a G. >> Um, plus we like him. We're Denver Bronco fans for sure. So pray with us as well that the Broncos have a great year this year. We need that. We need that. It'll uplift Denver. We need that. Let's go. >> Money on them. So already >> Let's go. So guys, thanks so much for watching this and tuning in. Um you have any questions on this stuff? Absolutely. Comment below and definitely make sure that you subscribe to our channel. We're pumping these out as often as we possibly can so we can help you with your golf game and hit some thumpies, baby. >> Yes, sir. >> Let's go. See you guys soon. God bless. Peace.\n",
      "All right, we talk about it a lot. Swingers versus hitters. We're going to go into it today looking at Jimmy Walker versus Victor Havlin. Let's roll. [music] Okay, here we go. So, we talk a ton about the differences between these two patterns all the time. I'll bring up Havland all the freaking time. If you guys know me at all, you know how much I just love Havlin's action. Um, and then I'll bring up other guys like swinger patterns like um, obviously Sheffller, you've got guys like uh, uh, Jimmy Walker here. Um, Nicholas was a swinger pattern as well. And so instead of me just standing up here and talking about like this is what what it kind of looks like in a in a hitter pattern, this is a swinger pattern, and I'm inevitably just showing that through my own mannerisms. What I'd really like to do today is actually take a look at these two athletes, Jimmy Walker and Victor Havlin, and compare them and really study why each system can work. And obviously they're two great players. I mean they've had uh very long careers on the PGA Tour uh with a ton of success. So who am I to say that one is better than the other? Uh we obviously have preferences. Our main reason for the preference uh is first and foremost preventative medicine where we're moving in a way that's it's it's very difficult to create injury in a certain pattern and then other patterns. I mean, we can just see now uh where injury tends to come from um when it comes to how you move in in your golf swing. And then we also have different preferences with like how fast the the club face rotates through the strike, heavy ROC, rate of closure, uh increases the likelihood for the athlete to hit crooked shots, catastrophic misses. So, for certain patterns that slow down that ROC rate of closure, that would obviously be a great thing. since inevitably we are playing a racket sport. Your ability to control the club face as a golfer is pretty darn important. And then we have other pieces and other aspects like h how you control low point is much different for each one of these athletes. Um and one can potentially be a little bit easier than the other. Again, obviously we've got a cat over here and it's going to and it's going to sound like I'm going to throw all kinds of shade at swinger type patterns. again, Nicholas, Jimmy Walker, these guys are great players. Sheffller obviously is a great player. So, it's definitely going to come across like I'm throwing shade at those types of swings because, of course, I definitely do have a preference when it comes to movement. But again, at the end of the day, what we're really going to study in this video is how one swing and those matchups, how they move their arms, how they move their entire engine, pelvis, rib cage, spine, blah blah blah, how those two different systems match up or balance out. So, with that being said, let's take a look. We'll start over here with Jimmy Walker and um just just study again how he he generally moves. So, if I just play this And what I'd like you to take a look at is just everything. You're just taking a a general look at how Jimmy is is really moving. I mean, you can take a look at obviously the top of a swing here, where the arm structure is, where his rib cage, where his pelvis um is in space. And then as soon as I I let him work into the forward swing here, take a look at his feet, where his pelvis is, where his rib cage is, how the golf club works through the strike. Okay. And then second, if we take a look over here at Havland and how he moves through the strike, we're going to see a much different action there. If you take a look at at his feet, um at uh at his at his legs, at at his pelvis, his rib cage, everything here. I mean, they're two very very different looks uh when when we're looking at the golf swing. So when you hear us talk about engine, when I'm speaking to engine, I'm talking about the spine primarily. If you want to geek out a little bit, you'll start to look at spine engine theory. Um, and what this theory suggests is that all movement originates in the spine and then gets expressed outward from there. So the the the the next closest systems, if you will, to the spine, obviously your head sits up on top of your spine. You got the rib cage that really attaches into the spine and in many different ways, especially in the posterior, obviously. And then you've got your pelvis. So how I move my spine in space is going to dictate where my pelvis moves, where my rib cage moves, where my head moves in space, and then it leaks out from there. If we look at the legs, it gets into the upper legs, into the femurss, goes down through the lower legs and into the feet. So, we'll see how each of these athletes, their foot action changes drastically and dramatically. And what I would also suggest, like if you're watching this video for the very first time and you kind of don't know our stick, there's a ton of other videos on our in our library here on our YouTube. one of the the uh the closest videos like in uh in time that we've done like a very recent video that we've done. Jackson and I actually did a video on athletic traits uh in movement. Um and it ties directly in with what we're going to see in Havlin's pattern. Okay. So, let's let's take a look at uh Jimmy Walker here first and kind of break this down. So, let's start with and and what we're really going to take a look at is is more more so the forward swing here. Let's start with his upper arms and his rib cage and how those two elements really work together. So, if we start to to to take a look at this with Jimmy as he starts to work forward, what you'll see is is the rib cage here as he gets into this kind of P5 section here all the way into the strike. What you'll see is his rib cage almost stops rotating and moves more into a lateral bend type of an action. So what he is doing inevitably is he is taking his arms and rotating them through the strike here as his rib cage stops rotating works up and works into a lateral bend in his right side. So, what we're going to see out of this kind of a player, a swinger type of pattern is a player once they swing it to the top, his rib cage starts to rotate a bit and transition, but then from here it'll work up and back into this trailside bend so he can take his upper arms, especially if we're looking at the lead upper arm. It lowers and externally rotates to square the golf club. So when I swing it to the top, even if I rotate a bit, but my intuition is to go ahead and express the golf club and square the golf club to the golf ball in this type of a manner. See how much rotation there is here in the upper arms. My rib cage works up and back to go ahead and express that golf club to the golf ball. So when I do that, we'll we'll talk about the pelvis here a little bit more, but see how the pelvis is migrated quite a ways forward towards the target. My rib cage is up and tilted back here to go ahead and express the golf club to the golf ball. So, what we're seeing when we're looking at the upper arms relative to the rib cage is we'll see the rib cage stop its rotation. It elevates, laterally, bends. So, now I can go ahead and square the golf club with a lot of rotation in the upper arms. That's obviously going to leak down into the hands as well and into the lower arms. So, we'll see more rotation, pronation, and supenation in the in the lower arms as well to go ahead and start to flash that golf club closed. At the end of the day, you got to close it somehow to square the golf club. And so, athletes that resemble Jimmy Walker's action, and you'll see it even how how this right arm starts to pass over the left here. Lots of pronation in that trail trail trail wrist, trail forearm. Lots of tilt back. Lots of lateral bend here in his overall shape in his rib cage and in his spine. And you'll see how much his pelvis is trying to push to get him up and out of that space. So again, he can lower that lead arm and externally rotate that lead arm. That's the pattern that we're seeing out of a swinger type of pattern. Okay. The way that those athletes are squaring the golf club is heavy in their arm rotation, they are not going to rotate the rib cage as much as a hitter type pattern when we look at havlin. So in comparison again, if we just take a look at Javi here and we'll get him up here to the top. Okay. And all we're going to study here, we're not going to necessarily look at his pelvis yet. We're just going to take a look at his rib cage and the upper arms and how they interact with one another. So much different even right here. And this obviously I've got I've got Jimmy here at like P8ish, okay? Where the shaft gets level to the ground again. Okay. But the arm structure here, if you take a look, look at the difference in Victor's arm structure. still heavy in internal rotation in the lead arm and and very heavy in the rotation of his rib cage. So what we'll see like if we just took a look at where like his zyphoid process or his sternum is pointing you'll see how that zyoid process points down and away here. Sternum points down and away that's more or less where his sagittal plane or his midline is pointing. There's a lot of heavy rib rotation here compared to a Jimmy Walker who's sat whose zyphoid process is more pointing out towards the camera here. It there there's a bit of a uh this is kind of a misnomer. Like if I do this from face on, this is a lot of lateral bend. This can fake out rotation when you're looking from from face on. If you look down the line, you'll see how shoulder axis shoulder axis. It's almost like the right shoulder is trying to trap back away from the target line. And so we'll see more of this out of swinger type patterns this luck compared to a havland who you'll see a heck of a lot more of this. So if you look at my shoulder axis here, this lead shoulder is rotating and pulling away from where the golf ball is. Look at how much heavier the rotation the rib cage is here in this kind of a map compared to a player who laterally bends. some of that as well. Like you don't necessarily look exactly at the shoulder axis for rotation because I can fake that out as well by retracting the scap and protracting the scap and now it looks like my rib cage is shut off. I didn't do anything to my ribs here. This is all in the scaps and in the shoulders. And I could do the same thing here to try to fake out rotation compared to again havlin as he rotates his his his rib cage heavily heavily heavily. This coronal plane through my rib cage now is all the way in this axis. Look at how heavy my rotation is where my sagittal plane or my midline would be is way further forward with that type of a map. Here's sagittal plane compared to again we see Jimmy looking here. The sagittal plane is right here still pointing towards the camera rather than heavy in rotation. Okay. So big time difference in look and and a massive difference when we're looking at the lead upper arm, the humorous bone relative to the rib cage. Look at Havland. Big time internal rotation in the upper arm here. And you'll see that by taking a look at where the anacubital fossa is pointing here. The anacubital is the opposite side of my elbow. So if I take this anticubital that right now is more or less pointing towards the camera and I point it away from the target, this is a direct reflection of internal or external rotation. If you look at Hav, you'll see all of this internal rotation of this upper arm relative to the ribs. He is rotating his ribs massively in here. Look at how much this sagittal plane has rotated. for a player like Havlin, how internal that lead arm looks. So, what is squaring the club? If I have a ton of internal rotation here, look at where the club face is. It's not squaring. If I have a ton of external rotation here, look at how much I mean that club face right here just rotated 90° by me looking by me throwing it this way. Okay. Tons of external rotation. This is what we start to see out of a Jimmy Walker. Sagittal plane's pointing forward. Look at all the throw in Jimmy Walker's upper arm. Anacubital is pointing straight at the camera. Loads of external throw right here. Rib cage has stalled out, stopped rotating, works up and into tilt into lateral bend compared to a havland who keeps this internal and squares the club more from rotating the chest to get that club face square. heavy rotation pattern, heavy arm rotation pattern, heavy thoracic rotation pattern, heavy arm rotation pattern, much different. Now, if we leak down, so we'll go from this relationship of ribs to upper arm. And now we'll start to take a look at the relationship between pelvis and rib cage here for each athlete. Now, obviously, there's some similarities here. What we'll take a a deeper look at is I'll stop both athletes at about P5 or so, which is where that lead arm gets back level to the ground. Coming back over here to our boy Jimmy. Stop him at about lead arm level. Right there is. Okay. So, right here we've got some similarities in in in each athlete. You'll see rib cage, center of mass rib cage. It's a little difficult to see this, but Victor's uh trail um lat line is right in here. Lead lat line is right in here. So, the difference between those is about right in here, which is where where his center of mass of his ribs is. Center of mass of his pelvis is right here. So, we're more or less stacked up. Boom. Boom. Boom. Right in here. That's about what we're going to see out of his trunk line. So, again, center of mass of ribs, center of mass of pelvis, right in here. very stacked up for this this particular athlete. When we look at Jimmy Walker again, his lat line is right in here. Okay, lead lat line, pelvis is right here. So, when we're taking a look at Jimmy as well, what's interesting is they're super very similar looks in each athlete right here at the at the fully loaded position. Roughly P5, maybe P5.5 is the fully loaded position. Body's loaded, arm lines are loaded, we're ready to hit right there. So, incredibly similar as we work through the strike. And I'll try to stop at about P9. P9. Position 9 is where the the trail arm now gets level to the ground. And we'll stop Javi at P9 as well. Right in here. Okay. Now, this is where we're going to see the main difference. We call this at Elite Golf Schools the hit. The hit is from roughly P5 to roughly P9. So it's this half moon where if I'm in in the loaded position here, fully loaded position, roughly P5, and now I get all the way to P9, we're going to see two totally different looks from P5. Almost all players on highlevel tours, okay? So [clears throat] any PGA Tour, development, developmental tour, PGA Tour, Liv, LPGA Tour, we're going to see a ton of similarities out of athletes at the P5 position. Almost all of them have a ton of like it looks the same pretty much. Okay. Now, big difference once we get back to P9 here all the way through the hit from each athlete. This is where you're going to see the biggest difference between a hitter type pattern and a swinger type pattern. If we look at again this relationship between the rib cage and the pelvis right now, we're going to still see a ton of stacked up. Looks like the pelvis is more underneath the rib cage here. This is more or less resembling, okay, the trunk line. If we look at Jimmy pelvis, rib cage, look at how much more tilt there is in his trunk line. Now, tilt is one of these funny words. I almost hate using it. The reason that Jimmy looks tilted is because his pelvis has shoved so far towards the target that now it takes the entire trunk. Look, and if I just move the pelvis up here, look at how much my trunk looks this way compared to a havlin type pattern. where his pelvis looks like it's more underneath his rib cage. The other thing that you're going to see, look at how much passover there is from the right arm to the left arm. My opinion, here's where I start to throw shade. He just completely destroyed his arm structure right there through the hip because he shoves this up. I've tilted here. The only the only way that I'm going to express the golf club to the golf ball is through heavy arm rotation. And so I can't maintain that same structure. So the structure that I have now is completely different than the structure I started with. So when we're looking at rate of closure, Rory Moy has a way higher rate of closure than Victor Havland. And they're they're they're measured in like frames per second and or or or uh the higher that number like Rory is in like the 3400 realm when it comes to rate of closure. So very high compared to Havland is at about 1,800. So what we're saying is that the face how rapidly the face starts to close down. It's a higher rate of closure compared to somebody who doesn't slam that face shut. as early. Now, Rory's upper arm to rib cage structure is is very similar to what we see out of a Victor Havlin. Look at this structuring right here. Totally different look. See how this triangle comes right out of his chest. So, as Victor works through and unloads the club, he looks more in here. This is super similar to the structure that he started with at a dress compared to a swinger type pattern. We're seeing all this passover heavy arm rotation again. That structure definitely changes a ton. Okay. So, his ability to stay structured through the strike with his arms isn't as good as a player like Havland who controls that structure at incredibly high levels. If you think about it, how is this golf ball ever going to go massively offline if he's maintaining that structure through the hit, the upper arms relative to the rib cage? And again, the reason that he's able to do that is he's able to continue to rotate the chest heavily. Look at shoulder socket. Shoulder socket. So his shoulder axis at P9 is right in here. How heavy did his chest or his rib cage have to rotate through the strike to have that look compared to Jimmy Walker. Look at how that totally shuts down with his with his uh shoulder axis there compared to where Havlin would be. All of that runs down now into the pelvis. How much Jimmy has to laterally slide that pelvis to control his bottom out. The way that swingers control their bottom out is they shove their pelvis far [snorts] way up into their left side gets my pressure into my left side as well. So if I'm on a pressure mat right now, that pressure mat would spike in my left side because of how much I shove the pelvis up here. Arm rotate to square it. How Havlin moves his pressure to the left side. First of all, just looking at this, looking at where his feet are, he still has plenty of pressure up here, but not nearly as much as a swinger type pattern. This is like 90%. 95% maybe into his left side. This type of a player, we're going to see 60 or 70% in their lead side at roughly that that P9 position. So, pelvis for players like Havlin stays more underneath them as they rotate their chest. If I if I drop this pelvis, I keep it dropped in and I swivel it in a manner that's more of a trail hip pivot. You'll see these players like Havlin where they'll look in here. This lead hip is working away from golf ball and away from target. So the trail hip is the pivot point. So now they can take their chest, rotate it through the strike, and it moves laterally. So I have more of this type of a look through the hip for a hitter type pattern [snorts] compared to a swinger type pattern. lead hip pivot athletes. Right hip goes out towards golf ball and forward towards target. Have all this extension in the trail hip. Lots of tilt here to keep the golf club slotted. And because of the pelvis working up and forward here, I'll we'll see the rib cage and the trunk elevate so I can lower and externally rotate. That's the biggest difference out of these two athletes. What you'll also see is in a player like this, see how when we look at the feet, a Jimmy Walker type of athlete, their heel migrates towards the target. Loads of pressure on the instep of the foot compared to a Havlin type athlete, hitter type athlete. See how Havlin's heel is trying to migrate away from target and his pressure isn't nearly as heavy into the instep here. You also see where his trail femur more on this angle. This knee stays underneath him. This is all pelvic pelvis related as well. Pelvis is more underneath him rather than slit up towards the target. Knee stays underneath him. Pressure stays off of instep. Heel migrates away compared to a a swinger type pattern. Look at the trail femur here. how much this knee has migrated towards the target and it drags literally drags that foot towards the target here. So if we do this kind of take a look at this dynamically now watch Jimmy's trail foot through the strike. See how it gets drugged forward? That's all because of the pelvis migrating towards the target. If we take a look at a havlin type pattern, watch his trail foot where the heel goes. See how the heel gets thrown away from target. Knee stays more underneath him. And we see this difference as well in the finish position. Look at look at Havlin's foot action here. We still have all this spacing. Knee stays here. So the knees aren't kissing. Pelvis more underneath rib cage. Knees kissing. This is this has migrated well forward. This foot has gotten drugged forward. Look at how close those feet are because that's that trail foot's gotten drugged forward because of the pelvis and there's more of this kind of seat out kind of a shape. So again, a lot of what we're looking at out of these two types of patterns and at the end of the day guys, look, it's your decision how you want to work on your golf swing. If you want to close the face down more in a swinger type of a map, you need to do that through arm rotation. You'll also need to shove your pelvis up towards the target more and and stall out your rotation in your chest in order to have any kind of success. Now, you'll be able to close the face down. You'll also be able to to to control the low point because of where the pelvis is. If you're looking to move more into hitter type patterns, which again, it's definitely our preference if you watch all of our information out there, what you need to do is you need to tone the pelvis out from moving laterally. It stays more underneath the rib cage. We're going to be way heavier in the in the rotation in the rib cage, and that's how we're primarily going to square the golf club as well for those types of patterns. Rotate the rib cage. See how this stays internal? Pelvis stays underneath me. So I can take the ribs and rotate and now that's how I'm going to square the golf club. But that's a much different look in hit compared to that type of a look. The relationship between the upper arms and the rib cage is huge in this. Then it migrates into the pelvis. The pelvis is going to move in space to support the intention of the rib cage and arm action. And then we'll see it all the way down into the feet. But I would take a look at all of those different segments. Manage them as best you can. If they match up and balance out reasonably well, you can have a lot of success in ball striking in either pattern. So hopefully this sheds a little bit of light on the differences between swingers type patterns and hitter type patterns. And at the end of the day, what we're super passionate about here at Elite is just helping you play better golf. So hopefully this comes across as a very holistic approach to attacking your golf swing rather than just reading some kind of a tip that comes out in a magazine or your local pro just gives you one type of tip. We got to take that act, whatever the tip is, whatever the movement is, and you've got to be able to map it out within the rest of your golf swing in the in the entire movement uh of your of your golf swing. Thanks so much for hopping in. If you have questions, as always, comment below. Can't wait to talk to you guys soon. Until then, hit me some flushers.\n"
